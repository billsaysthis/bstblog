<p>Country musician Marty Stuart is lining up top name artists for a <a href="http://launch.yahoo.com/read/news.asp?contentID=207554">Johnny Cash 70th birthday tribute album</a>. Due out in March, among the songs will be Springsteen performing "Give My Love To Rose," Dylan covering "Train Of Love," and Little Richard doing "Get Rhythm."</p>
<p>Also, I heard on the radio that Springsteen is in the <a href="http://www.southerntracks.com/">studio now in Atlanta</a> recording a new album. Checking one of the primary Bruce fan sites, <a href="http://www.backstreets.com/news.html">Backstreets Magazine</a> reports that guitarist Nils Lofgren confirmed this report on a recent ESPN Radio show. Lofgren "qualified the sessions as the first step of several toward a new album, and that he hoped Springsteen would keep taking the necessary steps toward a completed album and subsequent tour." Backstreet reports the sessions were "fucking smoking" and feature a harder-edged rock sound. OMG, I can't wait to hear this stuff. Lofgren has his own new release due out Tuesday, music he composed as <a href="http://www.nilslofgren.com/store.html">soundtrack for the All-Madden Show</a>.</p>
