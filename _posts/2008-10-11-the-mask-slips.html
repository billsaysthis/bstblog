<p>In an amazingly stark essay called <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/11/opinion/11herbert.html?em">The Mask Slips</a> in the Op-Ed section of today's NY Times, Bob Herbert writes without an ounce of subtlety, politeness or indirection what so many of my friends and I have been saying to each other for years now:<br /><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><br />
<blockquote><span style="font-style:italic;">"For the nitwits who vote for the man or woman they'd most like to have over for dinner, or hang out at a barbecue with, I suggest you take a look at how well your 401(k) is doing, or how easy it will be to meet the mortgage this month, or whether the college fund you've been trying to build for your kids is as robust as you'd like it to be."</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Reading that word nitwits--the quote is the second paragraph of the essay--took my breathe away!</p>
<p>The few hundred words Herbert uses felt like a sculptor's chisel, straight to the point and unerringly profound, the undeniable truth revealed from the normal nattering of pundits and apologists.</p>
<p>The Democrats should simply buy reprint rights, run off a few million copies and put them on windshields of cars parked at school playing fields and churches throughout the so-called battleground states.</p>
