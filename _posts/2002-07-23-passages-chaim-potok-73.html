<p>One of the great Jewish American writers of the pos-WWII era, Chaim Potok <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/books/AP-Obit-Potok.html">died today of brain cancer</a>. Often compared to Herman Wouk, Potok focused more on the challenges of living as a religious Jew in American society while Wouk focused his stories more on Israel. Potok was perhaps best known as the author of <em><a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/Titles/chosen/about.html">The Chosen</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.lasierra.edu/~ballen/potok/Potok.asher.html">My Name is Asher Lev</a></em>. He was also an ordained rabbi, a university professor, and editor in chief of the Jewish Publication Society of America</p>
