<p>What an awesome start my Reds are having to the season, eight wins, two draws and... and nothing! Not one loss, even throwing in Champions League and Cup play. First in the table and the best opening run in club history. It's early days, no doubt, but for the first time in this decade the team is in the Premiership title mix.</p>
<p>86 and out refers to our win last Sunday at Stamford Bridge, 86 being the number of league home matches played there since Chelsea last walked off the grass losers. Only 1-0 but I will take it unreservedly, especially with Fernando Torres injured. Sweet, sweet news.</p>
<p>A trip to White Hart Lane this weekend will test us against the resurgent, Harry Redknapp-led Tottenham. Spurs have taken more points in his two games in charge than the eight previous under Ramos. I question the wisdom of paying in the neighborhood of $9 million for the right to sign another team's manager but Juande Ramos never got his legs with the team and surely had to go.</p>
<p>Redknapp will get them out of the relegation battle, that late comeback yesterday against the Arsenal is proof, but I do wonder if three games in seven days is a bit much to ask of his squad. If Torres is fit, I favor us to take all three points on the road.</p>
<p>Speaking of Arsene enger's boys, does this year's model seem a little less than expected? The loss to Fulham and yesterday's late giveaway make me hopeful that his team will spend this season battling Aston Villa and Hull for the four through six slots. Walcott is coming of age on the right and Adebayor is a monster in the middle but the backline may not be up to the challenge.</p>
<p>Manchester United are revving up now that the engine man is back from injury, getting both goals in yesterday's 2-0 win. So far you have to put their record down to the many injuries, plus the adjustment to Berbatov up top, but I do wonder a bit about discontent among the players. Tevez appears the most vocal now but when Hargreaves and Scholes get healthy where will that leave Fletcher, Anderson, Park and Nani?</p>
<p>Chelsea are doing fine under Scolari, better than I thought they'd start off, but again they may have too many world class stars to avoid that trouble. The Blues will be strong and challenge all year but I wonder if in May the title will be down to Liverpool and Man United.</p>
<p>One can but hope!</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Update, 1 Nov.:</span> Sadly the 'Pool fell victim to the Redknapp Revival, losing out near the death when Daniel Agger lost his man well inside the six yard box. I'd have thought the lesson Arsenal provided, that you cannot let up until the whistle against these guys, would have sufficed, especially with Arsenal's loss early today to Stoke City as compound. But no.</p>
