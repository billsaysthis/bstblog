<p>I put this short list together for friends of my parents and decided not to let it go to waste.</p>
<p><em>The Man Himself</em>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://atkinscenter.com/">Atkins Center</a> - the official website, click on Shop to get to the products but also has many articles and recipes</li>
<li><a href="http://atkinscenter.com/shop/products/Bread_Mixes.html">Bread Mixes</a> - I've had the Country White and enjoyed it<br />
</li>
<li><a href="http://atkinscenter.com/shop/products/Muffin_and_Bread_Mixes.html">Muffin mixes</a> - Blueberry, Banana Nut<br />
</li>
<li><a href="http://atkinscenter.com/img/assets/609/carbgramcounter.pdf">Official Carb Counter</a> - this is good to have on paper, lists the carb count for pretty much everything</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Elsewhere</em>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.greenbeanz.com/">GreenBeanz</a> - Good prices for an online store (probably better in general than the Atkins site)<br />
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lowcarbluxury.com/">LowCarbLuxury</a> - new to me but has recipes and other material<br />
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lowcarb.ca/low-carb-recipes.html">Low Carb Recipes</a> - Author Karen Barnaby publishes recipes and runs a good online forum where you can post requests for specific recipes<br />
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/cgi-bin/nut_search.pl">Searchable USDA Nutrient Database</a> - carb count and complete information for pretty much anything<br />
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.grossweb.com/asdlc/faq.htm">alt.support.diet.low-carb FAQ</a> - great FAQ for the Low Carb newsgroup, and the newsgroup is worth the time on a regular basis</li>
</ul>
<p>Have some more good ones? Let me know.</p>
