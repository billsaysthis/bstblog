<p><strong>I heard the news today, oh boy</strong></p>
<p>George Harrison, the quiet Beatle, <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/newsarticle.asp?nid=14998">died today</a> after a struggle with cancer; he must have known his time was near as he passed away at a friend's home with family and friends with him. I hope he got his fondest wish, to walk closer with his God. I'm not going to try and write another eulogy or biography of this man but just to pass on my favorite memory of his music. When I was little, in the late 1960s, I used to go rollerskating many Saturday afternoons with Joannie Reich in Livingston, NJ. Joannie was the first girl I ever kissed one Summer afternoon in the closet in my bedroom. When we went skating, we were the only little kids to be out on the rink during couples only skates, since you had to hold hands. Our favorite song to skate to was Harrison's biggest contribution to the Beatles and still one of my favorite lve songs, "<a href="http://www.thebeatlesongs.com/something.htm">Something</a>." The lyrics and the gentle melody are so simple and beautiful, two things one ould surely say about the man himself. Harrison did many great things in his life but this will be how I remember him most fondly.</p>
