<p>This morning's SJ Mercury News editorial page published a <a href="http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a20/News/a20New001.htm">My View column</a> by State Senator <a href="http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a20/">John Dutra</a> (D-Freemont) explaining his vote on SB773, legislation that would have given Californians some privacy from the companies with which they do business. The bill was defeated by a very small number of votes, including Dutra's. I'm sure you'll find his posturing ridiculous and a blatant attempt to cover his ass from allegations the financial industry bought his vote; I know I did. I wrote the following letter to the editor:</p>
<p>State Senator John Dutra, explaining his vote on the SB773 privacy bill, gives us a pretty good example of why so many people distrust politicians and feel they have no voice against the huge dollars corporations spend on lobbying and campaign donations. Given the recent changes in how the Mercury News reports on Wall St. and other market analysts, by giving a brief statement of their interest, I expected to see something similar accompanying Dutra's essay. A listing of companies (and their executives) affected by SB773 who've donated to his campaign efforts in recent years and perhaps other similar information would be nice.</p>
<p>Specifically, of the three "central problems" Dutra cites with this legislation, I am referring to his second and third items. Some high-tech companies would be adversely affected? Some financial companies would certainly consider the effects adverse, otherwise why lobby against it, but in his first item he points to the unfairness of treating companies differently--surprised me how quickly he lost that thread of logic.</p>
<p>To lose some chances to be marketed at by companies I already do other business with? You mean that steady flow of junk mail might find some gaps on the occasional day? I'm sure my postal carrier would be as happy as me if that might happen. Seriously, the companies can still save their customers money but it might take a little more effort on the part of consumers. Taking some time to educate themselves on what they're purchasing might end up with more people making more intelligent choices. Even if it cost me a few dollars here or there, though, this is still a small price to pay for keeping some of my vanishing privacy to myself.</p>
<p>I hope that MN columnist Dan Gilmour is right and that we get a real privacy initiative on the ballot soon. As the voters in North Dakota showed, that's the only way consumers will get any measure of privacy in our current political atmosphere.</p>
