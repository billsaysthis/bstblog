<p>Amazing tax avoidance scheme allowed by the IRS which, surprise, only benefits estates larger than $10 million: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/28/business/28TAX.html?ex=1028433600&amp;en=dacb98d97bcb65fd&amp;ei=5006&amp;partner=ALTAVISTA1">I.R.S. Loophole Allows Wealthy to Avoid Taxes</a>. Buy expensive life insurance, claim you paid the lowest fee charged despite having paid much more (the premium would be considered a gift to the heirs), then avoid even the gift tax by using a trust. Brilliant move by a creative insurance agent and lawyer and ridiculous that the IRS would approve it--but they did, in 1996!</p>
