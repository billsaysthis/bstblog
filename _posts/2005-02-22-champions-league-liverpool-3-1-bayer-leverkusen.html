<p>Continuing a strange up and down season, the Reds hosted Landon Donovan's new German club and beat them <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=169919&amp;cc=5901">3 - 1</a>; the American international didn't come on until the 69th minute, however, and had little effect on the result. The odd thing is that as much as I wanted them to win, I didn't consider it very likely given recent form, a multitude of injuries and the required absence of Steven Gerrard through suspension. Yet the team closed up after some early struggles, the only score allowed coming seconds from the end, so another strange outcome in LFC2004-05. Two weeks from now the reverse fixture will be quite the test; Gerrard will be back but how will Leverkusen's away goal play into the final result?</p>
