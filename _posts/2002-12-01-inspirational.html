<p>congratulations on three years of blogging to garret and thanks for the cool and always <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com">dangerousmeta</a>. amazing that he could go so long an never once need to use a capital letter, at least not that i've seen. funny, he posts many great and creative <a href="http://dangerous.phpwebhosting.com/ngallery/">photos</a> but hardly any of himself. garret is a friendly, helpful, caring man and i would back all of this up with links to his site except that the one thing he's never had are permalinks or a sitewide search facility. doesn't that seem strange for someone who make his living building websites and web applications?</p>
<p>i need to visit santa fe and meet this guy in person soon.</p>
