<p>For some reason Postmodernism is a topic that has been catching my eye a lot lately. garret pointed to a very interesting Daniel Dennet essay today, <a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/articleprint.php?num=13">Postmodernism and truth</a>, and I recommend it to any of you interested in a contrast of scientific and philisophical truth or, rather, Truth.</p>
