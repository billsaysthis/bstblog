<li>Putting his money where his mouth is: <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/headlinenews?id=274370&amp;cc=5901">Kirkland's dad hopes for payback time</a>. When the Liverpool goalkeeper was about 10, his dad went down to the local bookie with nine friends and the each put up 100 pounds at 100-1 odds that Chris would one day play for the English national team. With the England-Croatia match this week, that bet might just pay off.</p>

<p><em>Afternoon update:</em></p>
<p>Rob works at the company which makes the operating system running on his laptop. Said operating system seems to have reached a <a href="http://www.crabapples.net/rob/archive/2003_08_17_default.htm#106131038767681837">critical negative juncture</a> in it's life, giving off strange messages when he powers on. Yet he seems <a href="http://www.crabapples.net/rob/archive/2003_08_17_default.htm#106132807302118772">oddly reluctant</a> to call tech support. What's up with that? But Rob, still, thanks for the positive feedback on my little project.</p>
