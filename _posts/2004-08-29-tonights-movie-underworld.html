<p>Vampires and werewolves in a fight to the death, is that original or what? Not very, and neither is <a href="http://www.entertheunderworld.com/">Underworld</a>. Released last year, the basic idea is that vampires and lycans are each descended from one son of a European nobleman whose blood mutated when he survived the plague but passed it on differently to his children. Hundreds of years later, in our present, the vampire clan has nearly wiped out their wolvish cousins though the reason for the emnity is never really stated. Notice the parallel to the mythic story that Muslims and Jews are descended from Cain and Abel?</p>
<p>In director Len Wiseman's conception, the creatures are all very stylish and very human in their emotions. One vampire is driven by ambition, another by hate, another by love; the only lycan we're truly shown simply wants to save his people from extinction. And while the action and pace do finally heat up and drive to a conclusion, we're left with all sizzle and no steak nonetheless.</p>
<p><em>not recommended</em> except to see Kate Beckinsale (now Mrs. Wiseman) in tight leather<br /></p>
