<p>Speaking of photos, Bruce seems to be <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/media/thumbnails/photo/2005-04/17019512.jpg">showing his age</a>. Which is okay with me--not that anyone asked, keep yer shirts on (esp. if you're my age or older)--and that's a bit surprising as I think about it. Growing up in the '70s, being comfortable with getting older wasn't in scope. By now I expected biogenetic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trope#Literary_usage">tropes</a> from then-current science fiction stories to have traveled to reality but the scientists in their labs aren't quite ready. Dudes, get busy. Well, busier. Maybe I'm not as comfortable as I'd like to believe.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Bonus:</span> AO Scott, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">NY Times</span>, offers an assessment of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/03/books/review/03SCOTTL.html?ex=1278129600&amp;en=01c45a216b273a1a&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">many recent books about Bruce</a>.</p>
