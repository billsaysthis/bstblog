<p>After days of poorly and not at all disguised negotiations, Detroit Lions CEO Matt Millen <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/columns/pasquarelli_len/1503579.html">came to an agreement</a> with Steve Mariucci on a five year, $25 million deal. Not only does Mooch more than double the salary he would have gotten from the 49ers (although he would have earned it for doing nothing but relaxing), he gets to go home as well. Though he does take over a team that is more or less craptastic, having won only ffive games in the last two seasons.</p>
<p>ESPN is <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/columns/pasquarelli_len/1503778.html">reporting</a>, though, that the new coach will have more say in personnel matters including the hiring of a new personnel director. Which will come in handy when he looks over a roster seriously lacking in star power. Second year QB Joey Harrington and All Pro DE Robert Porcher are terrific but the cast mostly drops off a cliff after them. ESPN's Pasquarelli suggests they'll use the second pick in April's draft to take Michigan State star receiver Charles Rogers and I think he's quite right to recommend the selection to help fill the seats at brand new <a href="http://www.fordfield.com/facility/index.cfm?no_rrail=true&amp;cont_type_id=2150">Ford Field</a>. Got to start somewhere.</p>
<p>ESPN is also running a front page poll on which of the new coaches (Parcells, Del Rio, Mariucci, and Lewis) will get their team in the playoffs first. Current results show Parcells in front with over 61% and the other three way back. Of course internet polls <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/technology/local/" title="Of course they're not printed, right?">aren't worth the paper they're printed on</a> and I would say that Del Rio's Jaguars are the closest to getting back in, even though the Cowboys had a couple more wins last year.</p>
