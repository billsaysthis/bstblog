<p>Surprising how fast <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_03_14_blog_archive.phtml#107957381755733947">three and a half months</a> can go by, but my contract as product manager at Intransa has finished. For better or worse, our new-ish VP of Marketing decided he would rather use the budget on someone significantly senior to me so no renewal or conversion to perm. Definitely been a cool time, though, with many assignments thrown my way that I'd never met before but the response in every occasion was very positive.</p>
<p>So, for the short term at least, I'm moving into the Sales team. Talk about new challenges! But I've been interested in putting myself to this test for awhile now and the sink or swim will be up to me. The specific project is to drive qualified leads out of trade show booth visitor lists, meaning lots of phone calls. I'll be working together with one of my good friends at the firm who is very optimistic and positive about our success. I'm doing finger-strengthening exercises for the long weekend!</p>
