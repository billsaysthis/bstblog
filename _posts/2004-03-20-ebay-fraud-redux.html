<p>eBay can be great if you?re an honest person, I know a few people who are making a living from selling on it, but that takes a lot of work an insight into what people will buy. But as the system gets bigger, more people will at least try to take advantage of innocent/naive/unsuspecting buyers, as happened the other week <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_03_07_blog_archive.phtml#107902271683168089">with someone trying to sell my guitar</a>.

Personally, I have my doubts about buying anything costing more than a few dollars without serious fact checking.</p>
