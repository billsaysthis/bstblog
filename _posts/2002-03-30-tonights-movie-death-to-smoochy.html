<p>Having <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_03_24_blog_archive.phtml#75042117">cried my eyes</a> out over not being able to see Robin Williams in person, we decided to check out <a href="http://deathtosmoochymovie.warnerbros.com/splash.html">Death to Smoochy</a> as a substitute. And what a grand substitute it is! Williams is blast-off superb here and Edward Norton shows why people are calling him a young DeNiro. As opposed to the piece of crap movie Norton was in last year with DeNiro, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_07_15_blog_archive.phtml#4556421">The Score</a>. This film is as much about children's television as it is about world politics, what we have is a smash up of a man crashing from the peak and another coming up from the pits, sort of a buddy-buddy, heterosexual version of A Star is Born. Lots of big charicature characters, a weasly Danny Devito, Catherine Keener freeswinging from slutty kiddie show host groupie to romantic, loving partner, Harvey Fierstein showing he's taking advantage of all the cigarettes he's smoked before they put him out of the game. Lots of laughs, lots of dark humor, and don't forget the <strike>midgets</strike>little people.</p>
