<p>A Spanish movie released in 2001, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0284491/">Sin noticias de Dios</a> (titled <em>Don't Tempt Me</em> in this subtitled English version) is a conflation of the end of the world and love triangle in a humorous vein written and directed by Agustin Diaz Yanes. Penelope Cruz and Victoria Abril are beautiful angels sent from, respectively, Hell and Heaven to fight for the soul of a boxer named Manny (Demian Bichir); the Rebellion is beating the forces of Heaven so badly that if Manny goes Down, the side of Good will finally be beaten and God is unreachable to give a hand.</p>
<p>I often wonder how well subtitles are translated, especially when dialog is intentionally subtle, and that was certainly true for me on this film. While Yanes' main intents came through well enough, I felt a small level of surreality creeping in when some of the peripheral characters had focus and when characters spoke longer bits of exposition. Acting, movement, imagery were all well done, nothing to really complain about, but the subject matter was so large that these other apsects were overwhelmed.</p>
