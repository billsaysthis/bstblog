<p>I found out from a message on the <a href="http://forum.textdrive.com">TxD forums</a> this afternoon that <a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">SpamAssassin</a> is enabled by default on all their servers. I've been wondering about not getting answers or other emails over the last couple of months since switching to TextDrive and this could be the explanation. <span style="font-style:italic;">Uggh.</span> Anyway, if there are any messages you sent me (and still have) to which you thought I would or should have responded but didn't, I've now disabled SA, so please resend them.</p>
