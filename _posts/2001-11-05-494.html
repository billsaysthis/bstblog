<p><b>It is about Islam: A call for Reformation</b></p>
<p>Farrukh Dhondy, writing in City Journal, discusses <a href="http://www.city-journal.org/html/11_4_our_islamic.html">Our Islamic Fifth Column</a>, how British (and to a lesser extent, American) policies have allowed groups of what is now clearly the enemy to develop and thrive in our midst. The article is a little lengthy but discusses Muslim migration to Britain and subsequent alienation and stagnation of that group, the Rushdie fatwa, a little-reported attempt by a group of mostly British Muslims to bomb British targets in Yemen, the Summer 2001 'asian' riots in several English cities (as Dhondy writes, "The riots had no targets, symbolic or strategic."), and that communties response to 9/11.</p>
<p>All these point to a fundamental disconnect in the lives of Muslims living in Western countries, that there is a major conflict between the values of the nations in which they live and those preached by the radical Islamists. Dhondy ends by tying these threads all together into a call for an Islamic Reformation, one which allows Muslims to continue their beliefs in Allah and the Koran but also permits them to live in peace with non-believers. Otherwise, the current attacks by Al Quaeda, supported by believers in many places, will escalate into a war in which the radical Islamists attempt to impose their religious beliefs on the entire world through violence.</p>
