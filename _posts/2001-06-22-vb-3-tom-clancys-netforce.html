<p>Another one of the series co-created by Clancy, <a href="http://www.clancyfaq.com/netforce.htm">NetForce</a> is the series' name as well as the name of the series' first novel. Written by, but not credited to, Steve Perry, this story introduces us to a new FBI unit called NetForce and is set 10 years in the future. Its also the novelization of a miniseries starring Scott Bakula.</p>
<p>Virtual Reality (VR) gear is standard, as is imposing your own visual metaphor for moving on the Worldwide Web (although driving a car or riding a motorcycle seems most common). The VR, so to speak, puts you in the driver's seat.</p>
<p>Perry does a good job here and I'm looking forward to the second in the series, next on the queue. Someone is creating chaos on the web, lots of deaths (RW, or real world, deaths, that is) and pointing lots of misdirections at NetForce. Which (and this isn't a spoiler as it happens in the first pages) is caught up in trying to solve the assassination of its first commander.</p>
<p>Decent reading but I will be looking to see if it gets stronger in book two. At this point, I prefer Clancy's own novels and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Op-Center</span> series to this one.</p>
