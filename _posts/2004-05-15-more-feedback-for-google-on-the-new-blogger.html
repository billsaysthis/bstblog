<p><em>[Originally posted to the Blogger Pro mailing list]</em></p>
<p>Not sure if <a href="http://www.shellen.com/2004/05/happy-bloggers-day.asp">anyone</a> at Google is reading this list but... I am sure there are plenty of code-level improvements underneath and I do appreciate the effort. Still, since there was no public beta test, I will share my constructive feedback here:</p>
<ol>
<li>What happened to the CTRL+ENTER and CTRL+SH+S keyboard shortcuts? Not everyone likes to shift to the mouse for everything.</p>
</li>
<li>What happened to the split frame? Some of us (I) appreciated the ability to read and/or copy and paste from previous posts.
</li>
<li>The new success page ("Your blog published successfully.") is a waste and requires extra effort to begin the next task. I would rather go to the Edit Posts screen with a success message added at the top (or somewhere visible).
</li>
<li>The new design is very, um, big. Especially the text. I would just as soon have smaller text and more on the screen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Props to the team, though, for finally clearing the issue with certain HTML tags (like lists) that caused excessive line feeds.</p>
