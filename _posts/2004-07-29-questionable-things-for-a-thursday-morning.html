<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/search/redir.aspx?AssetID=DC011359641033&amp;Origin=HH011412531033&amp;CTT=5">Office System 2003 SP1</a> may be out but it still doesn't fix one of my pet bugaboos: when using the space bar to read longer than one screen email messages in the Preview Pane, Outlook often mistakes the middle of the message for the end and skips to the next one.</p>
