<p>Mike Arrington (<a href="http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=18">Microsoft Live Event - My Real Time Notes</a>) does a decent job of laying out the details of today's big news from Redmond. Interesting that BillG and Co came down to San Francisco for it, lion's den and all that. In a year or two they may have something of real value though for now I think some of the hyperbole is overdone.</p>
<p>You know what I'd like first? Fix the software I already have. How is it that Outlook (accurately) marks messages as spam but Hotmail doesn't? I use a third party tool to suck down the Hotmail into Outlook--MS used to let you do that directly but decided we should pay for the feature, yeah right--and most of the time Outlook's spam filter pushes them to the Junk folder. If anything Hotmail's rulebase ought to be fresher.</p>
<p>So Bill, do you really think what small businesses want is a <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/RolaksOnline/Blog/cns%211peycz0_mpHutLeQGjPVpzrw%211091.entry">free website with ads from competitors</a> at the top of the page? Me, I'd just like what I've got to do what it says on the box.</p>
