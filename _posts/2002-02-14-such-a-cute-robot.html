<p>Isaac Asimov was perhaps the premier author of science fiction featuring robots and created one of the premiere robotic concepts, the Three Laws. So I'm glad to read that <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news_company.jhtml?storyid=NEWS.REUT.20020214.N14174226rtr&amp;ticker=HMC&amp;provider=companynews">Honda has a robot named Asimo</a>, a four foot high humanoid, in his honor. Asimo rang the bell to open trading on the NYSE today, celebrating Honda's 25 years as an NYSE-listed stock.</p>
