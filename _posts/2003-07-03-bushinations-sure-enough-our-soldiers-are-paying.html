<p>Paying for <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_06_29_blog_archive.phtml#105716151829913882">yesterday's idiotic assertion</a> from Pseudo-president Bush. Ten soldiers <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/03/international/worldspecial/03CND-IRAQ.html?hp">were injured</a> in the next day! The Administration's idea of a response? To repeat the offer of big dollar rewards for information leading to the capture of Saddam or his sons. The arrogance of this Administration is simply beyond belief.</p>
