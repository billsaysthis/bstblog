<p>11 for 11, what a fucking triumph for Peter Jackson and Crew! As the ceremony went on, with win after win, I started wondering if the voters were giving the team lots of lesser awards to make up for losing the important ones. But no, <em>Return of the King</em> went all the way!</p>
<p>To <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_02_29_blog_archive.phtml#107808117207687010">wrap up</a>, Vivian and I were correct on Best Picture, Director and Actress, Vivian got Sean Penn and I had Baldwin and Zellwegger. Nicely done show, Billy Crystal was really funny, though I'd like to know where the rock music went, even a bad Aerosmith tune like their <em>Armeggedon</em> thing from a few years ago. Two from <em>Cold Mountain</em> was one too many but can't quibble with another RotK trophy. Anyone else think they had to put a gun to Jackson's head to get him into the suit and tie?</p>
