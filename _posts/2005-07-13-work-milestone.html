<p>For those of you hanging out breathlessly, you can now experience <a href="http://www.rawsugar.com/">RawSugar</a> for yourself. After some amazing effort from our Engineering team in Israel with support from the humble Palo Alto crew, we pushed an alpha release yesterday for public consumption. For us alpha means it works--I rarely see any errors-but isn't feature complete; we've just locked down the next rev, which should be ready around the end of the month and are arguing furiously about the follow on due in August.</p>
<p>But it works and works well. You can create collections of tagged pages (with vitamin-packed notes) and search either just a collection or the master database of all collections. Some interesting examples:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://alpha.rawsugar.com/collections/GreetingsFromAsburyPark">Greetings From Asbury Park</a>: all about Bruce Springsteen</li>
<li><a href="http://alpha.rawsugar.com/collections/wwheelers/wwbc">Western Wheels Bicycle Club</a>: biking in the Bay Area and beyond</li>
<li><a href="http://alpha.rawsugar.com/collections/shimon/Shimon%20Golan%20Site/">Shimon Golan's Music</a>: links to popular tunes played by one of our developers</li>
</ul>
<p> Like I said, we've got plenty of new features coming soon but what's there today is solid.</p>
