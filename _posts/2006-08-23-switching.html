<p>After playing the fields of Ruby on Rails for much of the last year, and seeing a buddy get a sweet one of his own from his new employer, I couldn't resist and will be joining the anti-borg in the next day or two. Timing is up to FedEx now so don't let me down!</p>
<p>Yes, I bought a MacBook, the (relatively) easy on the pocketbook <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wo/0.RSLID?mco=A4791B5D&amp;nclm=MacBook">white 2.0 GHz model</a>. I am not quite so enamored to spend $150 extra just to get it in black or $4-500 to get the two inch larger (and aluminum) MacBook Pro. I will add memory, to the 2GB limit but from a 3rd party vendor for $200 since Apple charges $500 for the house brand.</p>
<p>The makers of several software products, Parallels and <a href="http://macromates.com/">MacroMates</a> and probably a few others, can expect orders from me too. I've been tracking a bunch of open source and shareware apps in anticipation, too. Tips and suggestions will be welcome, of course.</p>
<p>Posting may be somewhat crimped from time spent getting up to speed with all the newness. I'm sure you'll understand. I can hardly wait!</p>
