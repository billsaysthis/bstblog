<p><a href="http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=608896E3-2E88-4C65-B3CF61624FF761F4">Pope to women</a>: Your place is in the kitchen and the bedroom.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&amp;storyID=5836602">Women to pope</a>: Old fart, this is the 21st Century, why don't you buy a clue?</p>
<p>I have to wonder, with all the problems the Catholic Church has these days--hardly anyone wants to be a priest, many of those that do abuse their positions of trust to sexually assualt children, forcing at least one diocese into bankruptcy with more likely to join--why this frail, barely alive old man felt the need to pick on women. The pronouncements on homosexuality and gay marriage earlier in the year were predictable, but this?<br /></p>
