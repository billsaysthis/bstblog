<p><b>Today's book: The Talented Mr. Ripley</b><br />

<p>I was going to do my usual review/writeup but Bob Wake <a href="http://www.culturevulture.net/Books/TalentedMrRipleybook.htm">has beaten me to it</a>. His review is much more eloquent than mine would have been. I wonder if I look anything like Bob Wake...</p>
<p>Ha! Read this great novel and you'll understand that crack. And yes, Matt Damon starred in the <a href="http://www.culturevulture.net/Movies/TalentedMrRipley.htm">movie version</a>. Roger Ebert has an <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/ebert/ebert_reviews/1999/12/122405.html">interesting review</a> that covers the Damon version as well as a review of the French iteration called <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/ebert/ebert_reviews/1996/07/070303.html">Purple Noon</a> and starred French great <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Delon,+Alain">Alain Delon</a>.</p>
<p>Author Patricia Highsmith <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search/002-6171523-9541634?tag=vickiehollemanbo&amp;keyword=patricia+highsmith&amp;mode=books">also wrote</a> four other Ripley novels plus Strangers on a Train, which Alfred Hitchcock made into a <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0044079">stunning film</a>.</p>
