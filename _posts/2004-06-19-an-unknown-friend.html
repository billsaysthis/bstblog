<p>Weekday mornings we drive to the train<br />
<br />Cold winters or what passes for them<br />
<br />in Mountain View and Summer my<br />
<br />Sweet answers the daily bell.</p>
<p>Buddy is our unknown friend, we<br />
<br />Pass him walking every time, even<br />
<br />in the rain, a smiley, craggy face<br />
<br />Wavy gray hair, blue windbreaker, arms swinging.</p>
<p>I call out "Hi Buddy" as we see him and<br />
<br />Sweet smiles or at least laughs since<br />
<br />in more than 18 months we have<br />
<br />Never actually met our good friend.</p>
<p>Seeing him walk across the Dana Street<br />
<br />Overpass or on Evelyn depending<br />
<br />on the time is reassuring, a constant and<br />
<br />Friendly reminder that age is not infirmity.</p>
