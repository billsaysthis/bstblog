<p><a href="http://bayosphere.com/blog/dangillmor">Dan Gillmor</a> has <a href="http://bayosphere.com/node/28">launched</a> <a href="http://bayosphere.com/">Bayosphere</a>, the first public effort of the new venture he launched after leaving the Mercury News. To Dan and the Grassroots Media team, I say congratulations on getting yourselves through the birth pangs and into the screaming infant months. Hopefully your effort will rival the impact of Karl's terrific <a href="http://www.phillyfuture.org/">PhillyFuture</a> and other localized web-based community systems. Even for a beta product, though, perhaps this launch was premature given the lack of information and/or functionality. A few things I'm pretty much in the dark on:
<ul>
<li>What I can do after registering, can I have my own blog?</li>
<li>How are my bookmarks used?</li>
<li>Can I control visibility of my (theoretical) blog and bookmarks?</li>
<li>What's already on the site other than your blog and comments people have left on it?</li>
<li>Who's behind Bayosphere other than yourself (neither grassrootsmedia.com nor grassrootsmediainc.com resolve to a 'company' site for this organization either)?</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm looking forward to a quality, exciting Bay Area-centric system and a new platform for reporting and analyzing local issues we face, opportunities we have and relationships we can develop. Thanks for taking on this challenge.</p>
