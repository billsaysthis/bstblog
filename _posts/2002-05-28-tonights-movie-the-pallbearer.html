<p>Because Friends is a successful TV show, the six stars get to make movies. David Schwimmer got to make <a href="http://psc.video.go.com/bvhe/videovault/products/1750303.html">The Pallbearer</a> and somehow convinced not only Gwynneth Paltrow but also Barbara Hershey and Carol Kane to sign on. He gets to sleep with Gwynneth and Barbara. And while he's still living at home with Mommy and unable to get a job yet. I mean, can you imagine a schlub like Schwimmer sleeping with such women? I can't but that's the magic of Hollywood I guess. Do I have to say it? <em>Not recommended</em></p>
