<p>I installed it, played with it. Seems okay, on the right track. My big issue is tabs and so far the desired functionality isn't quite there. I'm looking for Save All Open Tabs as a Group, especially, and can't seem to make that happen. Also, the help is less than inspiring, I don't want to have to go searching through forums and FAQs for every little answer. Still, worth the time to keep under inspection and I will easily admit that I might just not understand how to do some of the things I say are "not there yet."</p>
