<p><b>Will Wheaton: Truly not lame</b></p>
<p>In a classic Slashdot interview,<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/10/29/173252">Wil Wheaton Responds to your Questions</a> and shows that age 29 (yeah, I know it's hard to believe) he's actually learned a few lessons from being a teenage TV star. And for the three of you who don't know, Wil played <a href="http://trekweb.com/tng/crew/wesley.html">Wesley Crusher</a> on Star Trek: The Next Generation for the first several seasons until he went off to learn about life on a higher plane with the Traveller. Wheaton has a <a href="http://www.wilwheaton.net">decent website</a> and in this interview he responds with humor and candor to reader-supplied questions about being hated on the internet and rubbing Shatner's belly.</p>
<p>An amusingly high portion of the thread posts in response say, essentially, "Hey, Wheaton is <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=23133&amp;cid=2494687">way cooler than I ever thought</a>. And he didn't blow his life away with typical child star crap. He even knows what a <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=23133&amp;cid=2495075">karma whore</a> is." But I knew Wheaton was cool, even back in the day.</p>
