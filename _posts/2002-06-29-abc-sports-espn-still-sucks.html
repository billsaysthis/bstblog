<p>All the games that have been played, all the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_06_09_blog_archive.phtml#85172609">mess with scheduling</a>, and you'd think that with only two games left the scheduling geniuses could do a decent job. But no! The third place match, which turned out to be a <a href="http://worldcup.espnsoccernet.com/report?match=48870&amp;lang=en">decent, interesting game</a>, wasn't available live, only delayed. 11 hours delayed here on the West Coast which made it impossible to not know the result. Between ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, and ESPN Classic, they couldn't find a two hour space to show it? Then do the tape delay thing if they want, too. What a bunch of morons!</p>
