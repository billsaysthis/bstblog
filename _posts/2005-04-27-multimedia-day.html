<p>If you haven't seen it yet, the <a href="http://movies.apple.com/movies/universal/serenity/serenity_ifs2.mov">Serenity trailer</a> (warning: link is directly to the large format QuickTime movie) is online and man does it look good. I'll be there Sep. 30, not much doubt in my mind. I was a fan of Firefly as a TV series--yet another cool Fox show that the network cut down before it was barely started--and the trailer shows the same creativity and mystery plus a visual <em>sharpness</em> that one rarely sees in computer generated films. Very appealing. But then Joss Whedon has a track record for that.</p>
<p>Today also saw the release of Springsteen's <em>Devils and Dust</em>, I picked up a copy but I might until the weekend so I can savor it. Then again, might not be able to resist the temptation. The VH1 <span style="font-style:italic;">Storytellers</span> was nice but the editing and interruptions, the odd way so many of his comments were layered on top of the performance, just didn't sit right with me and so didn't sate my yearning.</p>
<p>And in a third medium, this year's novel from Harlan Coben arrived today as well. <a href="http://www.harlancoben.com/static/novels/ti.htm">The Innocent</a> stays in the tense thriller genre of his last few books but does include a new Myron Bolitar short story in the American editions. In his newsletter Harlan wrote "I don't want to say too much, but I will say, letting those two characters out for air has felt great--and I don't know that I'll be able to put them back in storage any time soon." After five years and five novels, all good, not complaining, I'm sure ready for another tale featuring my old buddy and his friends.</p>
