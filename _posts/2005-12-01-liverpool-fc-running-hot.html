<p>With the win 0-2 today at bottomdwellers Sunderland, the Reds have shaken their early season woes with an EPL record-tying fifth consecutive shutout by Jose Reina. The three points lift the club to fourth in the league table, one point behind Arsenal and two behind Manchester United, and they'll host surprisingly hot Wigan--the other team with 25 points--at the weekend. Annoyingly, I thought I'd set Tivo to record the match but apparently not; I do have the Wigan match on the To Record list and should be able to squeeze it in before the plane ride.</p>
