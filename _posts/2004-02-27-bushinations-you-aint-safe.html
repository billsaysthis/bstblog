<p>John Robb <a href="http://jrobb.mindplex.org/2004/02/27.html#a4344">points to</a> an interesting perspective from Jeff Jarvis <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2004_02_25.html#006366">on why Howard Stern was really removed</a> from those Clear Channel radio stations: the Bushies (and Clear Channel's leadership is clearly part of that team) wanted payback from Stern after he decided Bush isn't fit for re-election this Fall. The shock jock has enough clout to swing some tens of thousands of votes, which is more than enough to matter if we end up anywhere close to a repeat of the 2000 voting results.</p>
<p>This is yet another prime example of the creeping, step by step effort by the Bushies to control government now and into the future. Looking at that sentence even I feel the paranoia rising like a bad stink but damn if the whole concept of paranoia didn't come about because this shit actually does happen from time to time. I'm not saying that Karl Rove has a team of people working in a basement office at the EOB plotting every move but they are always looking for opportunity to advance their case, and Stern, via his call with Paris Hilton's stud, gave them what looked like just enough rope.</p>
<p>This is bad.</p>
