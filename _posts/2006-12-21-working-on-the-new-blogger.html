<p>After a five hour wait my account seems to have migrated to the new Blogger. I'll see if the new labels feature will do much for me, otherwise the main value will be the hopefully robust new code base and architecture that allows the Google squad to add or enhance features more rapidly.</p>
<p>Since I don't (obviously) publish on Blog*Spot the new layouts aren't available to my blogs and I'll respectfully disagree with their claim on having improved the Dashboard design (the new layout uses more screen space and all blogs show as having last updated today even though that's only true for this one).</p>
<p>Anyway, cheers, congrats on finally getting this puppy out of the barn.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Update:</span> Well, those of us not publishing to Blog*Spot cannot control the labels other than what's possible through CSS styling so they're a pass for me for now.</p>
<p>Also, this change has broken my access through the Blogger API on the Book Reviews page. I'm working on fixing this but it might take a day or two as I didn't write the underlying code.</p>
