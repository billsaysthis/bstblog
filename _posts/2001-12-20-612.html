<p><strong>Micro-advertising experiment, day five</strong></p>
<p>Wondering if the evening hours would do much, I waited until almost midnight to check the results. What were they? 21 total clickthroughs out of 1957 accumulated views for a ration of 1.07%. Very decent Tuesday with seven clickthroughs but very poor Wednesday with only two. Boo hoo hoo.</p>
