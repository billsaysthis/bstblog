<p><b>Finally, a big alliance for iPlanet Application Server</b>
<p>C|Net has report out this morning (<a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-5872830.html?tag=mn_hd">Sun announces software, service alliances</a>) on a new partnership for iPlanet and Sun with i2 to develop a version of i2's CRM software that runs on top of iPlanet Application Server. Another positive in the announcement is that PricewaterhouseCoopers is participating as a consulting partner; one thing I've found is there are nowhere near enough consultants for this stuff.</p>
