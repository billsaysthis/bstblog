<p>By the way, you can listen to all of <em>How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb</em>, the full version of every song in your choice of media players/formats (though no OGG) over at <a href="http://www.u2.com/">U2.com</a>. Just judging by the first five tracks--you have to click each one separately--this is a monster. Definitely going to be worth the $10 or $12 retail when the stores have it Tuesday.</p>
