<p>All four teams I favor have made it into the second season: 49ers, Giants, Raiders, and Jets. And Cleveland! Which is cool because it means the Patriots go home early. Yesterday was fun, although a little nerve-wracking as the crapo referees took away two Giants touchdowns with bad holding calls. The Raiders just toyed with the Chiefs all afternoon; they used the monsoon to get their first shutdown in 85 games against them. The 49ers don't play until tomorrow but their result is meaningless now and the biggest need is to avoid injury, which means that Tim Rattay, Paul Smith, and Cedric Wilson should get a lot of playing time--they even get a break with the scheduling as they'll host the late game on Sunday. The Jets <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=221229020">destroyed</a> the Packers, which was a joyful outcome, and completed an amwesome turnaround from a 1-4 start.</p>
