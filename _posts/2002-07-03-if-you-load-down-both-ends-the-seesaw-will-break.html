<p>Recently I <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_06_23_blog_archive.phtml#85203653">posted</a> about the Florida woman who is suing the State of Florida, which refuses to issue her a driver's license unless she submits to having a full frontal photograph of her unveiled face taken. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/27/national/27LICE.html">This woman</a> is a good example of one end of the spectrum regarding cultural attitudes towards women, the Islamic point of view which seems to say that men can't be trusted to control themselves unless women are covered from head to toe.</p>
<p>Today <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com">garret</a> points us to the other end, an article on <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/63173.html">the treatment of women in Mexico</a>, land of machismo, where few women report rapes and when they do the police ignore them, abuse them, or allow the men to buy their way out of punishment.</p>
<p>Just thought I would point out the contrast. Then again, how does that old saying go? Too much of anything is a bad thing?</p>
