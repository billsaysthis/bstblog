Public life is <a href="http://byrd.senate.gov/byrd_speeches/byrd_speeches_2005_march/byrd_speeches_03012005.html" title="How else would you classify something called the nuclear option?">nasty</a> these days, from any point on the spectrum, and it will get worse before (<span style="font-style:italic;">if</span>) it gets better. I find evidence of this discourtesy lately on every level of politics and every situation--internal business decisions, volunteer groups, discussion boards--where politics comes into play.</p>
<p>Perhaps I'm lately too close and too observant and this is only an example of "the grass is always greener" except, of course, with opposite meaning, intensified and more visible because modern technology has increased the breadth and amplified the speed of communications. But I doubt it; I think our civility has decreased on both absolute and relative levels.</p>
