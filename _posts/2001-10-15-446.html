<p><b>Microsoft still aiming at J2EE</b></p>
<p>Many observers have said that a target, perhaps the main target, of Microsoft's .Net web services strategy is <a href="http://java.sun.com">Sun's Java</a>. In the most clear indication yet that this is indeed true, Mary Jo Foley writes that <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article/0,3658,s%253D1884%2526a%253D16280,00.asp">Microsoft Readies "Indigo" for Web Services</a>. Indigo is the next generation web services, developer-oriented platform from MS; the article says that the company plans to include it in a version of Windows expected to be released in Spring, 2003. <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article/0,3658,s%253D1884%2526a%253D16429,00.asp">Services planned</a> for the platform include common naming, addressing, security, event and messaging using XML, <a href="http://www.soapware.org/">SOAP</a>, WSDL, and <a href="http://www.uddi.org/">UDDI</a>. A very early test release is likely to certain development partners next week at the Professional Developers Conference.</p>
<p>Indigo compliments the other .Net initiatives: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/myservices/services/default.asp">.Net My Services</a> (also known by the code name of Hailstorm) for consumer-oriented functionality and Blizzard for B2B/ecommerce functionality. Blizzard is also far from release and analysts do not expect a public announcement of it until next year.</p>
