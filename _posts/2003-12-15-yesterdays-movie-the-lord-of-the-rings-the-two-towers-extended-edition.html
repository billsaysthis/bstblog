<p>What a great way to spend a Saturday! The extra scenes were like gems except for Faramir's flashback to the day his father sent Boromir off to Elrond's council. <a href="http://www.lordoftherings.net/index_synopsis_ttt.html">The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Extended Edition</a> was a bargain at $9.50 compared to so many other films that come out these days. Peter Jackson just has the magic touch and might even convince me to see <em>King Kong</em>.</p>
<p>Can I wait for Thursday when we see <em>Return of the King</em>? Barely! I have a feeling it'll put the battle scenes from <em>Gladiator</em> and <em>Braveheart</em> to shame.</p>
<p><em>Absolutely recommended</em></p>
