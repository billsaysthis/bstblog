<p>I had the pleasure of attending <a href="http://2010.sf.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp SF 2010</a> with <a href="http://2010.sf.wordcamp.org/attendees/">over 770 WordPeeps</a> at the new Mission Bay Campus in San Francisco yesterday as I'm working on a WordPress plugin for Kachingle that will be available (very) soon (<a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23wcsf">Tweets</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/wcsf/">Flickrs</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/wordcamp2010/">more Flickrs</a>).</p>

Overall a good day:</p>
<ul>
<li>My pal <a href="http://dentedreality.com.au">Beau Lebens</a> gave a good lightning talk on <a href="http://gravatar.com">Gravatar</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://ma.tt">Matt Mullenweg</a>, who is a terrific speaker, <a href="http://artpredator.wordpress.com/2009/05/30/state-of-the-wordpress-2009/">gave us an overview</a> of the nearly-ready WP 3.0 (which this site already runs on) and the State of the Wordiverse.</li>
<li>Rinat Tuhvatshin, co-founder and executive director of the WPMU-based Kloop.kg portal (<a href="http://kloop.info">English</a>), the largest blog hosting platform in Kyrgyzstan, gave an inspirational talk about how Kloop was the only serious news organization in the country to report on the initial actions in the recent uprising that overthrew the national government.</li>
<li>Richard Stallman is a passionate and thoughtful man but why he was given a major speaking slot at this event is a bit beyond me. Dude should get past the whole GNU 'plus' Linux thing already.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/">Niall Kennedy</a> (<a href="http://videopress.com/">VideoPress</a> lead) and <a href="http://josephscott.org/">Joseph Scott</a> gave separate but terrific presentations on WordPress plugins.</li>
</ul>
<p>Quibbles: The lunch was kind of blah. I mean, no salad, just some nasty barbecued squash, no fruit and no tables to sit at while eating? And the parking was supposed to be $5 but I got charged $24--and getting out of the garage took over 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Question I did not get answered, though: When will WordPress.org get better search?</p>
