<p>So Amazon sends me an email this afternoon to announce a contest with a grand prize (excuse me, "GRAND PRIZE") of a trip for two to Honolulu with two tickets to a Jack Johnson concert there in late April. I'm not much of a Jack fan but, hey, a weekend in Honolulu, where we've never been, on someone else's dime appeals to me.</p>
<p>I click the link in the email to hit the contest landing page. Instead Amazon shows me the page of rules, with a pretty image of Mr. Johnson at the top to click to enter:</p>
<p><a href="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/music/JackJohnson._V11379660_.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/JackJohnson._V11379660_.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />What do I get after the click? A 404! "<b>Looking for something?         </b>We're sorry. The Web address you entered is not a functioning page on our site"</p>
<p>Let's see how well Amazon's web monitoring does, if they notice either the error from the 404 and send another email (either to all recipients or, since the URLs are personalized, to me) with a correction or, even better, this blog post.</p>
