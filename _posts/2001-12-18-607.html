<p><strong>Greetings from Florida</strong></p>
<p>Fooled you, didn't I? You read the headline and thought I was in Florida. I bet <a href="http://weather.yahoo.com/forecast/Boynton_Beach_FL_US_f.html">Boynton Beach, Florida</a> (where the picture below was taken) is warmer than <a href="http://weather.yahoo.com/forecast/Mountain_View_CA_US_f.html">Mountain View, California</a>, where I actually am sitting. Still, my friend Betsy sent in this recent photo of her new beau Steve and herself. Aren't they a cute couple? Here's a holiday wish that Betsy and Steve <a href="http://www.torah.org/learning/lifecycles/marriage/marriage1.html">'take it to the next level'</a> sooner rather than later. Are you listening, Steve?</p>
