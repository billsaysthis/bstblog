<p>Just saw FSW's Bundesliga highlights show for last weekend, the first games after a month+ winter break, to find out how the two new American signings made out. Kasey Keller, currently Coach Arena's choice for the US team, threw a shutout in his first start for Borussia Monchengladbach, two nice saves making the highlight show. Landon Donovan, reportedly just recovered from a weeklong bout with the flu, and so he only came on in the 84th minute, long after the scoring ended, as his Bayer Leverkusen mates <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/match?id=170856&amp;cc=5901">scored all three goals</a> to beat Hannover 96 (which is captained by USA defender Steve Cherundolo); with luck he'll be healthy and on from the opening whistle against Bochum Saturday.</p>
