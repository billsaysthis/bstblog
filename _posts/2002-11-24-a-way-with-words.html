<p>Being able to express one's self with words is very important to me. The Sweet One is very shy so the first few months we were together she didn't really let me see this ability in her conversations. As time passed she warmed up, relaxed (hell, she even passed the road test for her driver's license!), let me know her true heart, and started writing a blog. I don't think she was very comfortable writing at first. Now, though, she is really <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/vivroar/archives/2002_11_17_archive.html#85708746">doing a nice job</a>. I love my Sweet One!</p>
