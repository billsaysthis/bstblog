<p>Along with the film release page updating the other day, I've added a little feature to the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/entertain/moviereviews.phtml">Movie Review Index</a> so that my one or two word rating shows as the tooltip when you hover your mouse over the title. Exciting, I know. Don't bust a gut trying to tell all your friends and neighbors. 234 entries in that database at the moment. I'll likely add the same thing to the book review index next time I add a review.</p>
