<p>Evan, the Sweet One, and I had an enjoyable afternoon at the <a href="http://www.city.palo-alto.ca.us/entertainment/chili.html">Palo Alto Summer Festival and Chili Cook-off</a>. We took a bunch of photos, but the old-fashioned, film kind, so I won't be posting them for a short while yet. In terms of the competition, the Sweet One voted for the Palo Alto Runners Club, Evan went for booth 16, but I had the correct answer: Home Brew. There was a pretty good turnout, probably 3,000 people or so, although this made for some long lines to get chili, especially at the Palo Alto Firefighters booth. The <a href="http://users.lmi.net/flameon/bio.html">Zydeco Flames</a> made some good live Cajun music including a rocking version of Al Green's <a href="http://www.talking-heads.net/media/takemetotheriver.mp3">"Take Me to the River."</a></p>
