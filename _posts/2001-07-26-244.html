<p><b>Proposal to rebirth American news</b><br />

<p>Poll after poll for the last 20 years has shown that Americans are losing faith in the mainstream news media. Robert Parry, editor of the Consortium News, has proposed a <a href="http://www.consortiumnews.com/Print/072501a.html">Superstation Democracy</a> to win back the public trust by putting aside "today's sneering punditry and vacuous journalism" and celebrating "what's great about America: the democratic ideals, the environment, its diverse people, its rich history, its grassroots culture." <a href="http://www.consortiumnews.com/">Consortium News</a>, to be sure, is a proponent of the modern Left, an analysis made clear by simple examination of the current table of contents. Which doesn't mean <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20010717/aponline085701_000.htm">Parry is wrong</a> either.</p>
