<p>Since I wrote about this odd ad campaign a few days ago, I've been getting a lot of hits from people coming though Google and other search engines but I had no answer for them either. Now, though, thanks to eWeek we can<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.eweek.com/article/0,3658,s%253D1884%2526a%253D22186,00.asp">solve the "mlife" mystery</a> and tell you it is coming from ATT Wireless. The "m" is for mobile and refers to a package of voice and data services that will be fully explained in some Super Bowl ads. Glad that's been explained, eh?</p>
