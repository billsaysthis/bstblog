<p><b>Liverpool FC: Rockin' Anfield</b></p>
<p>With a fairly simple <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/england/news/2001/1105/20011104insider.html">3-1 victory over Manchester United</a>, the <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/england/clubs/liverpool/index.html">Liverpool Reds</a> moved into second place in the Premiership, one point behind Leeds with one game in hand, and showed that all the championships won in the last year are just the beginning of a new era. Earlier this week, the Reds shut out Borussia Dortmund to finish the first phase of the Champions League in first place in their group and draw two teams they beat in last year's UEFA Cup, Barcelona and Roma, in the round of 16 second phase. Even with manager Gerard Houllier <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/columns/2001/1031/20011031featpowell.html">in the hospital</a> and off the grounds for another two months, mad scorer Michael Owens is leading the boys for more silver.</p>
