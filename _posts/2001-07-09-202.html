<p><b>Yesterday's movie: Cast Away</b><br />

<p>Something I didn't realize until looking this movie up on IMDB bu the title is actually two words--<a href="http://www.foxhome.com/castaway/index_frames.html">Cast Away</a>--not a single word. Oh, how arty and meaningful! Hanks is Hanks, a great actor, and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Zemeckis,+Robert">Robert Zemeckis</a> (Forrest Gump, Contact) did a good directing job but overall I just don't get it. The two (since this movie is almost completely a one man show) spend two hours setting us up for a huge emotional ending and then leave us almost completely unresolved. Granted, the obvious ending would have been corny, smarmy, and completely Hollywood. But the path they chose is no better and I blame scriptwriter <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Broyles+Jr.,+William">William Broyles, Jr.</a> (Entrapment, Apollo 13) and Hanks, who together plotted this film Recommended for big Hanks fans only.</p>
