<p>I Googled this, I searched the MS Support pages and newsgroups, I asked the other people here at work who use FrontPage and yet still have no answer. So here is the question: how do I create a page which lists the files in a directory on the server? The name of each file should be a hyperlink to open it. In PHP this would be a trivial exercise for me but of course we don't have PHP installed on this Windows server. Crap.</p>
