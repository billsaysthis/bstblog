<p>Forgot to include this last night. I made the Atkins Crustless Cheesecake. Very tasty but I ate too much of it. I paid the price at this morning's weigh-in, believe me. The very simple recipe is: mix 12 ounces of softened cream cheese, a teaspoon of vanilla, and three packets of sweetener (Splenda) with a cup of heavy cream beaten to have soft peaks, refrigerate for a half hour. The result has 20 grams of carbohydrates and I ate half. Plus I used my finger to clean the mixing bowl, because waste is a terrible thing. Just terrible. And very white. And yummy!</p>
