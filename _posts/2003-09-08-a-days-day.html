<p>Started off the day with not enough sleep, for the usual reason, but then the weigh-in showed a loss of a half pound, followed by a decent workout and fine morning coffee.</p>
<p>Read about <a href="http://booknotes.weblogs.com/2003/09/08#sleepTightWarrenZevon" title="via DangerousMeta">the passing of Warren Zevon</a>, very sad. Was going to write my own little tribute but what more is there really to say? He was great, he lived wild and hard, he died satisfied.</p>
<p>Read another chapter of <em>Pragmatic ADO.NET</em>, about halfway done now, this one on "Working with DataSets." Very strong book, tightly focused, and not too much time/space wasted on repeating crap out of the reference manual.</p>
<p>Lunch with a good older episode of <em>Law and Order</em> (George Dzunda was still the lead detective) and a trip to the post office to mail off some sold merchandise and a bonus cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Back home to struggle with the CSS. I'm coming to the conclusion that I will either need some help or have to give up and revert to tables. That would suck. I've been reading a bunch of web articles on CSS and positioning/box model but to no avail. Suckage!</p>
<p>Tonight should be better. TS1 is cooking a dish called Salmon and Bok Choy, or at least features those two main ingredients--nummy! And BBC America's Mystery Monday has a new episode--the <a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/genre/drama_mysteries/rebus/rebus_ep4.jsp">fourth and final episode</a>--of <a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/genre/drama_mysteries/rebus/rebus_about.jsp">Rebus</a>.</p>
