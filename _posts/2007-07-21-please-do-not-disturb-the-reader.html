<p>There will be a break in the bill:routine this weekend as a copy of <span style="font-style:italic;">Deathly Hallows</span> has found its way here. Normally I don't purchase hardbacks, the cost is too high compared to the free library or other loan source or paperback, but the exception was made for Ms. Rowling's latest because:
<ol>
<li>TS1 and I both enjoyed the previous six so much and will both be reading this volume, a wonderful though rare occurrence;</li>
<li>The probability of avoiding significant spoilers before I could get it from the library or in paperback approaches the null set;</li>
<li>Cost was substantially reduced by purchasing it at a heavy discount;</li>
<li>The book itself was produced with extremely environment-aware resources; and,</li>
<li>We will also have the pleasure, after my lovely wife finishes her read, of donating it to an appropriate children's charity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Enough; time to start Chapter Two, <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memorium</span>.</p>
