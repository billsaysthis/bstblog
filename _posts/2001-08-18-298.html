<p><b>The Sun sets on Bill</b><br />

<p>After four and a half years, I'm sad to say that I'm no longer codependent on, or employed by, <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems</a>. Looking for a product, busdev, or tech support manager? Here's <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/misc/blazar_res_05_01.phtml">my resume</a>. I've been on a personal leave for the last few months, recovering from the stresses of the previous few years and recharging my batteries, and the economy went in the crapper so that while I was supposed to return from leave earlier this month no job exists to which I can return. I expect my timing could have been better, eh?</p>
<p>But I had a good run and won't complain. I had fun, met some great people, made a decent salary, and even have some stock that's still worth money (even if it is far less than a year ago). I signed on at NetDynamics just as the company was reving into high gear--there were only 60 employees when I joined but we added a hundred more in the next year. I had a great manager (Jim, you're the best!). I had five different jobs in 18 months. I managed a team of a dozen people who went on a death march in the summer of 1999. I helped launch the first certified J2EE application server.</p>
<p>I'm at a good point in my life and while I would have preferred to return to Sun after this break, even though finding a new job will be tough, I'll be fine. Don't worry, send me names of good recruiters and companies that are hiring.</p>
<p>So long, Sun, and thanks for all the fish.</p>
