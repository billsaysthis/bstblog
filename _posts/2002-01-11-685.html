<p><strong>AIDS Ride lawsuit petition</strong></p>
<p>Last month, I <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_12_16_blog_archive.phtml#8050567">wrote about</a> the lawsuit filed by Pallotta Teamworks against the SF AIDS Foundation and the LA Gay and Lesbian Center regarding their dispute over the annual AIDS Ride fundraising event. The non-profit SFAF and LAGLC, after contracting with Pallotta Teamworks to manage the previous bicycle rides between SF and LA, have decided that Pallotta has mismanaged the events and spent too much on overhead and are therefore going to hold their own events without Pallotta involvement. Pallotta is suing, claiming the contract it has with the non-profit orgs prevents the orgs from organizing their own bikeathons.</p>
<p>Former riders and crew volunteers are very upset about this and feel Pallotta should withdraw it. They've set up an <a href="http://mitch.phpwebhosting.com/">online petition</a> asking Pallotta to drop the lawsuit. They registered the domain <a href="http://www.ridepetition.org">RidePetition.org</a> and hopefully that will work soon too but there is little time--the suit goes to court this Monday (Jan. 14). So if you or anyone you know has ridden in or volunteered for the event, please send them to <a href="http://mitch.phpwebhosting.com/">this URL</a> ASAP. Thanks!</p>
<p>A side note: I actually did the authoring of this little website. Felt really cool to help out on a good mission and to stretch my skills in a small way.</p>
