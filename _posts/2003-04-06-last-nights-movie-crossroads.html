<p>First scene with Britney shows us the starlet dancing and singing along to a Madonna tune wearing only panties and a tight, barely there top, then wriggling into pajama bottoms. So we know who the target audience is for this film, no doubt. <a href="http://www.crossroadsmovie.com/">Crossroads</a> is a poorly made piece of pop twaddle which I only watched because TS1 desired it, and I was drained after two <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=234000031">really</a> <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=234000062">good</a> NCAA semifinal games. And there was the unintentionally hilarious scene where Spears and her high school pal rent a room to finally shed their virginity.</p>
<p>What's wrong with <em>Crossroads</em>? Just to name a few things: she drives crosscountry to meet the mother who abandoned her at age three but the confrontation lasts all of 45 seconds and avoids the actual difficult emotional interaction; in what is alleged to be her first time singing on stage, Britney belts out <i>I Love Rock and Roll</i> using all kinds of tricks and techniques that only a professional knows; Dan Ackroyd plays her Poppy in yet another wooden, emotionless payday performance; and, every problem encountered by anyone in the cast is solved without more than shedding a few tears, except for one medical situation, which can't have been very hard either since the girl involved is up and bouncing around a stage a short time later.</p>
<p><em>Recommended only for ogling Ms. Spears</em></p>
