<p>This sounds cool: New Line <a href="http://www.theonering.net/staticnews/1061560805.html">will re-release</a> the first two <em>Lord of the Rings</em> installments for one week each beginning two weeks before the release of the concluding movie, <em>Return of the King</em>. But not just what we saw before, the extended versions: 208 minutes for <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em> and 214 minutes for <em>The Two Towers</em>. Some theaters will even go over the top: on Dec. 16, a daylong marathon during which all three films will be shown back-to-back. Exhib guidelines call for a 3 p.m. showing of <em>Fellowship</em> followed by a 7 p.m. screening of <em>Towers</em> and then an 11 p.m. screening of <em>King</em>. Oh my. Think of your bladder and the big picnic baskets. OH MY!!!</p>
