<p>Props to Luke on a very nice new rev of <a href="http://www.sharpreader.net/">SharpReader</a>. Not sure why he doesn't call this 1.0 yet, but that's one of those little mysteries in life that will one day be answered. My main concern is that with each micro-release he's fixed more of the usability issues I had. This time he got some biggies:<br />
<br />&nbsp;<br />
<br />Remembering the app's window size and position. I would have though that some of the basic .Net plumbing would have handled this from the start but good to see he's conquered it.<br />
<br />Remember treeview expansion-state across sessions. Handy for me because I like to keep the category nodes closed and read them at that level rather than the individual blog level.<br />
<br />MouseWheel now scrolls control over which mouse is hovering, instead of the focused control. So now long entries won't require the entry window to be selected.<br />
<br />&nbsp;<br />
<br />All told, much to like especially since SharpReader is still freeware. I even got in the first thank you in the <a href="http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2004/07/19-200.html">announcement thread's comments</a>.</p>
