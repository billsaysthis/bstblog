<p>Woooo! We're having an earthquake as I type this. The desk is moving from side to side, though not strongly enough to flop anything down from shelves. No loss of power.</p>
<p>The Sweet One says there were some books and files falling off the shelves in her office in San Jose. No damage, no one hurt. A buddy down the block, who was relaxing on his couch, says he didn't even feel it in the least.</p>
<p>Okay, over now. That was vaguely disorienting, almost enough to give me a little motion sickness. First one I felt here in Mountain View for over two years.</p>
<p><em>A Few Minutes Later:</em> <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/recenteqsUS/Quakes/nc40148755.htm">This was a 6.5</a>, centered about 130 miles south of here not far from Hearst Castle outside of San Luis Obispo. Apparently felt well into Southern California too as <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/30367">comments on MetaFilter</a> show.</p>
