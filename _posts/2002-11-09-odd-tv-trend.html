<p><a href="http://www.fox.com/firefly/">Firefly</a>, Alias, Birds of Prey. What do they all have in common? Not just that I watch them. All have such complex backstories that an explanation must be repeated at the beginning of each episode. Not the opening credits but "After the Earth was used up, we found a new solar system and hundreds of new 'Earths' were terraformed and colonized." <a href="http://www.thewb.com/Shows/Show/0,7353,%7C%7C1002,00.html">Birds</a> explains the origins of our three heroines. Alias, which changed up from last year's explanation, gives us the scoop on how Sidney Bristow came to work for the evil men at SD-6. I find this...strange. If one simply watches the show, these facts are known and repeating them every week gets under the skin of regular viewers.</p>
<p>Firefly also has a <a href="http://www.fox.com/firefly/weblog.htm">weblog</a>!</p>
