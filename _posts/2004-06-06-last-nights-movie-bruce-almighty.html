<p>Jim Carrey's character in <a href="http://www.brucealmighty.com/">Bruce Almighty</a> might, to quote a song from the soundtrack, "have the power," but the movie sure doesn't. There are some funny bits, I am hard pressed to imagine a Jim Carrey movie that wouldn't unless he decided to do a remake of <em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em>, but director Tom Shadyac equivocates on the movie's core. For a comedy, especially farce, the movie dips too far into melodrama and for anything more serious it goes way past acceptable into slapstick.</p>
<p><em>don't bother</em> unless you're a Carrey fanatic</p>
