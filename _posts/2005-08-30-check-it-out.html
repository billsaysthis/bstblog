<p>Our engineers are so cool. Not only did they throw together RSS feeds--though by throw I mean seriously engineer--we now also have the ability to import from del.icio.us (the file produced by <a href="http://del.icio.us/api/posts/all">http://del.icio.us/api/posts/all</a>). This is an important feature because, for now, a lot of people who could take advantage of RawSugar's capabilities have substantial sets of tagged pages there; providing a two step import means their collections can start with all previous work reused. A big win, for sure.</p>
<p>Compare for yourself: I set up a clean <a href="http://www.rawsugar.com/collections/billsdelicious">RawSugar collection</a> into which I imported all my <a href="http://del.icio.us/billsaysthis?settagview=list">del.icio.us links</a>. Navigate through both and see the difference in your experience finding information and specific pages. You can have the same, <a href="http://www.rawsugar.com/">no charge</a>.</p>
