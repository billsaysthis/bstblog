<p>Halftime for USA-Mexico and the Americans are ahead 1-0  at Jeonju Stadium on Brian McBride's blast in the eight minute off a lovely pass from Josh Wolff. The US is playing a very defensive layout, four defenders plus Reyna hanging back from a rightside midfield spot, and this is frustrating our southern neighbors. Enough so that their extremely agitated coach Javier Aguirre has used one substitution already, sending MLS vet Luis Hernandez on in the 28th minute in place of Morales in order to have an extra attacker. The strategy has had its plusses, the Mexicans have twice the possession time of the Americans, and the Mexicans held the ball in the US end for most of the last five minutes of the half.</p>
<p>By the way, McBride has a hottie blonde wife, they showed her during a halftime profile without naming her. But definitely hot.</p>
<p>USA: 45 minutes away from the team's first win ever in a World Cup knockout stage game. And a matchup with Germany.</p>
