<p>Culminating a Summer of increasingly difficult hiking, Byron and his buddy Rob took on <a href="http://www.nps.gov/seki/whitney.htm">Mt. Whitney</a> and beat it like a silly snow toy. Mt Whitney, for those of you unfamiliar with your American geography, is the tallest mountain in the lower 48 states and is a part of the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. If you think you're up to the challenge, check out this good informational site: <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~bclk/dayhike.htm">The Mt. Whitney Day Hike Page</a>, and then think again.</p>
<p>This photo was taken at the summit, which is (drum roll please) 14,436 feet above sea level:</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are friends like Roger, who had the following response to the picture: "Will those guys who did all those fake Apollo/Man-on-the-Moon pix ever quit?"</p>
