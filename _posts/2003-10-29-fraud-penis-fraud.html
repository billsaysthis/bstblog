<p>People (including me) <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001002.html">complain about spam</a>, about the voluminous quantities of it, the frequency of the message being pornographic but lately I've decided that the real problem is that most spam is fraud. Out and out criminal fraud because there is no way to increase penis size or legally watch PPV movies without paying for them. So why do we need laws against spam when so many of the sleazes could be prosecuted on that basis?</p>
