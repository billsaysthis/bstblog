<p>Turning out to be quite a lovely day here. After breakfast TS1 and I went to the farmer's market for the first time this year to pick up fruit and flowers for gifts and brocolli and English cucumbers for ourselves. Tasted <a href="http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/pomelo.htm">Pomelo</a> for the first time ever, a fruit related to grapefruit but even larger and not as much bite, I liked it. The fruit and some of the flowers are for a gift basket for our neighbors to celebrate the recent arrival of their baby Alan.</p>
<p>The other flowers are to bring to Pam's wedding in a few hours. I'm so happy for her and Henry because they make each other so happy. I think the sunshine is nature's blessing on the joining, the forecasts were for clouds and a chance of rain as recently as yesterday morning, and yet we have blue skies and a warm Spring day.</p>
<p>We're making a diet change soon and Sunday morning visits to the farmers market will be a regular part of it, I'm excited.</p>
