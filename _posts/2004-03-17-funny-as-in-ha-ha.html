<p>You'd think, those of you who've read this site with any frequency, there's nothing I won't write about. Mostly, you'd be correct but there are a couple of very different things going on right now that I'm just holding off mentioning but are taking a lot of my time and mental energy so not much posting. Both of these things are very exciting and interesting and I look forward to writing about them. One will be sooner (tomorrow?) than the other though. Cross your t's and dot your i's and come back again.</p>
