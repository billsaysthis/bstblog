<p>If you are receiving a few dozen of this annoying fucking infested messages every day like I am, take a gander at the article Microsoft has posted on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/antivirus/authenticate_mail.asp">how to recognize them</a>. Fortunately my Norton Anti-virus installation has caught every single one and I'm not foolish enough to run their attachments anyway, but I sure would appreciate a chance to shove my fist down the throat of whoever's sending them, repeatedly.</p>
