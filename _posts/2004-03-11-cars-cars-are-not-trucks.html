<p>Today is definitely a sad day for my family because, for the second time this week, close friends of my parents were involved in a serious road accident. Last Friday one married couple was hit head on by a driver who drifted into their (oncoming) lane at reasonably high speed; both of them are still in intensive care and one still in a coma.</p>
<p>Worse, yesterday afternoon another couple, a wonderful, caring husband and wife I've known since I was 15, were <a href="http://www.nj.com/search/index.ssf?/base/news-13/1078989247122020.xml?starledger?ntop">killed in a major pileup</a> on the NJ Turnpike, their car crushed between a truck and a bus. I remember the Trotts so fondly and their older daughter Susan was responsible for me meeting my first wife. They will be missed.</p>
