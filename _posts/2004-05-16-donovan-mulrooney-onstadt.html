<p>Fox Sports Net gave Man of the Match to Earthquakes keeper <a href="http://www.sjearthquakes.com/fan_pages/051104onstad_diary.htm" title="He keeps a weekly diary, but no RSS">Pat Onstadt</a> tonight in the game against Dallas but I say Landon Donovan's goal in the 14th minute was the key play, not to mention his slick passing and tireless running up and down the field all game. Okay, Brian Mulrooney's deep drive in the box in first half injury time ending with a terrific pass back into the center which Brian Ching touched into the net was their play of the game and hard to argue with a beauty like that.</p>
<p>Whichever choice you make, there is no doubt this was an important road win for San Jose. They withstood serious pressure over the last 10 minutes as the Burn did their best to pick up the tying goal. Here's one indicator: the Burn had 13 corner kicks to none for our side. Onstadt is generally so emotionless but he must have been stoked after last week's debacle.</p>
<p>Amusing aside: The Quakes are running a cute TV commercial featuring a preacher (does anyone know this actor?) who eventually turns around and shows the big team logo on the back of his suit jacket as he starts chanting "We want three! We want three!" Referring, of course, to the team's goal this season of capturing their third MLS Cup, sentiment with which I obviously agree.</p>
