<p><b>The ND bosses are at it again</b><br />

<p>I'm not complaining. NetDynamics was a great place for me to work and the company's sale to Sun Microsystem has to be rated as a win too. So I can't wish anything less than the best to Zack Rinat (ND co-founder and CEO), Yarden Malka (ND's most important engineer),  and Olivia Dillon (ND VP of Engineering) in their new venture, <a href="http://www.modeln.com" title="New motto: Building Smarter Bricks">ModelN</a>. <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/cn/20010515/tc/b2b_start-up_zeroes_in_on_relationships_1.html">C|Net</a> and <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/st/010515/24486.html">Industry Standard</a> have brief looks at ModelN's new positioning, an attempt to move beyond first generation B2B software (this was the thrust of their launch PR a year ago) into what they call Private Business Networks.</p>
<p>For a look at their original plans, see this <a href="http://www.redherring.com/index.asp?layout=story_generic&amp;channel=%25rh_channel_id&amp;doc_id=RH490013449">Red Herring article</a> from July, 2000. Where now only ModelN is spoken of, in this article ModelN is described as a set of three companies (with more to come). Model T1 was to be the center, a technology company that owned significant stakes in the rest, which were to be vertical Internet marketplaces. "The first of these marketplaces [Veranto] is for medical supplies. The second is for construction." Checking out the Veranto website, only <a href="http://www.veranto.com/contact.html">Contact page</a> is publicly accessible, and it asks interested parties to email ModelN. I can't find any references to either marketplace company on the ModelN website although since the site has no search function it's difficult to be certain.</p>
<p>I'm not sure it's really anything more than accepting the reality that public B2B markets are not living up to expectations but I believe Zack and Yarden are probably smart and savvy enough to make this a success too.</p>
