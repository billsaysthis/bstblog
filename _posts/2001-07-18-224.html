<p><b>Sleeping policeman</b><br />

<p>A lot of what government does is regulate behavior: under 21? can't drink, have an infection? get a prescription before you can buy antibiotics, really mad at someone? oh no, you can't kill them! Coming soon, per this <a href="http://www.economist.com/science/tq/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=662350">Economist.com article</a> is intelligent speed adaptation, technology being developed in Europe that will combine GPS with maps that include speed limit information to prevent drivers from exceeding that limit. Sure, I know, speed kills and causes more accidents and higher insurance premiums but somehow I doubt this will get too far in America, the home of the free. <a href="mailto:bill@billsaysthis.com?subject=intelligent speed adaptation">What do you think</a>?</p>
