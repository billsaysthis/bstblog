<p>Just stupid. A Montana man who was legally Bob Craft until, in late 1997, he changed his name to Jack Ass is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/12/31/offbeat.jackass.reut/">now suing</a> Viacom (parent of MTV) for defamation and wants $10 million in damages. He's concerned that people will confuse the MTV show and movie of the same name with him and his good works. As if <em>anyone</em> stupid enough to call himself Jack Ass, whatever the reasons, could be defamed.</p>
