<p>Ghana coach Ratomir Dujkovic says teen sensation <a href="http://www.worldcupblog.org/world-cup-2006/freddy-adu-should-play-for-ghana.html">Freddy Adu should play for Ghana</a> at World Cup 2006 this summer. Seriously dude, put the has brownies down. The DC United star has already played for the US National Team, coming on as a sub in the last CONCACAF qualifier against Jamaica, so I'm pretty sure <a href="http://www.fifa.com/en/media/index/0,1369,101644,00.html" title="See article 15 paragraph 1 of the Regulations Governing the Application of the FIFA Statutes">he can't play</a> for any other country's side. Besides, why would he want to play for the country his parents had to flee when he was a little child? Is that how people where Dujkovic comes from say thank you?</p>
