<p>For the third straight year, playmaker Landon Donovan <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/headlinenews?id=316794&amp;cc=5901">has won the Honda Player of the Year award</a>, given to the top American soccer player. DeMarcus Beasley, definitely one of my favorite players as well, was second and defender Carlos Bocanegra third. Donovan becomes the first player to win three in a row and he was already the youngest winner two years ago, though DMB would have beat that and still could if he wins next year.</p>
<p>This probably seals the deal in terms of him joining Bayern Leverkusen, the German club that owns his contract, when the transfer window opens with the new year. If he does, will FoxSportsWorld show more of Leverkusen's games? They broadcast one German league match every Saturday morning now, not sure how the specific matches are chosen. Playing in Europe is important for Landon to take his game to the next level and the timing is right for America's World Cup 2006 effort.<br /></p>
