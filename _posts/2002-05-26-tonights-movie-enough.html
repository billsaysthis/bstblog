<p>"You have a divine animal right to protect your own life and the life of your offspring." Of course, a slutty waitress (played by Juliette Lewis) knows the philosophical laws of life, right? Anyway, <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/enough/main.php">Enough</a> is a decent movie, especially for the female viewers--the women in the audience I saw it with applauded when J. Lo finally struck back. Given the epidemic of violence by idiotic (moronic) men against women in this country and others, I'm not at all surprised that this film was finally made and Jennifer Lopez was a good choice for the lead. Though I don't get why so many people think she's so sexy. Billy Campbell has no problem being the big, bad scary dude. And, yeah, once again we did not get into About a Boy. <em>Recommended</em>.</p>
