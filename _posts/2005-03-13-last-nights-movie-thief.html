<p>After seeing <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2005_02_27_blog_archive.phtml#111008261674308264">Heat</a> again the other day, I noticed Mann's 1981 similar themed <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083190/">Thief</a> coming on one of the movie channels and put it on the Tivo's to do list. Yesterday I sat down to watch the movie and was surprisingly disappointed; so much so that I deleted it after only 40 minutes.</p>
<p>The elements that Mann would go on to develop in <em>Miami Vice</em>, <em>Heat</em> and most recently <em>Collateral</em> are all present: dark but sharp visuals, quickly cut; ambiguously good or bad man as protagonist; and pulsing, pounding synthesizer music. One significant improvement in his later productions was adding a substantive contrasting character, here James Caan has no real mirror to work off and so is left dangling like a boxer alone in the ring punching at air.</p>
<p>Further, even at the 40 minute mark I wasn't even sure of the movie's central conflict. James Caan's character is the titular criminal and is his problem the fact that a bigger fish in the Chicago criminal scene (Robert Prosky) wants to assign Caan work? If so, Mann made a big mistake devoting a single scene to this after a full third of the movie has passed.</p>
<p>Further, what's the story with the waitress Jesse (played by Tuesday Weld) relationship? I turned off the film after Caan's long autobiographical soliloquy to her in a coffeeshop. Perhaps we're being told that Caan wants to get out of a life that has given him little pleasure but setting it up by having Caan physically drag Weld out of a bar--he's two hours late and she's lost interest--and throw her into the car completely destroyed my sympathy/empathy for him.</p>
<p>Enough. Mann's made better and spend your time watching those. One good thing, can't finish without mentioning, is the soundtrack. Though he turned to Jan Hammer and a smoother, more commercial take for <span style="font-style:italic;">Vice</span>, German art rockers Tangerine Dream deliver a great soundtrack to <span style="font-style:italic;">Thief</span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">not recommended</span></p>
