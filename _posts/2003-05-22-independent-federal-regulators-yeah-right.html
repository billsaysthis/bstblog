<p>Just to show how our federal government really works, check out this <a href="http://www.reuters.com/financeNewsArticle.jhtml?type=governmentFilingsNews&amp;storyID=2789648">Reuters article</a> on an analysis by the Center for Public Integrity which shows that "Federal Communications Commission officials have taken more than 2,500 trips since 1995 that were mostly paid for by the industries the agency regulates." The agency's spokesperson claims that they don't have the budget for the trips but getting out to the people is necessary to properly regulate the industry.</p>
<p>Put that up with William Safire's most recent column, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/22/opinion/22SAFI.html">The Great Media Gulp</a>, in which he explains that the future of our media regulation rests on the shoulders of an unknown 36 year old lawyer who holds the swing vote on the FCC. Lovely. Of course none of the major media outlets are covering the story anyway: <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/05/22/fcc_blackout/print.html">The Big Blackout</a>.</p>
