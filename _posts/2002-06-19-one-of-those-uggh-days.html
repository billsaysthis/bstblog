<p>Wake up too early, before the alarm clock is even close. No Italy-South Korea match on Tivo, no idea why, but the overtime would have been left off even if the game had been recorded (think I fixed that for the quarters). Email access from work seemed spotty although difficult to diagnose. Someone entered a request in our other system to have the ads removed from their Blog*Spot account with no payment because it "messes up the look." A person I know writes and makes me jump through hoops for no particularly good reason.</p>
<p>Worst of all, no Sweet One!</p>
<p>Will dinner and Bad Company with the bud cheer me up?</p>
