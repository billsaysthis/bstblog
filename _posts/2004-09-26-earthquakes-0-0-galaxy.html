<p>I really don't know what's wrong with the Quakes lately. Tonight they played as if their bodies were wrapped in cold fish, and that's typical of the whole season really. No Ching and Derosario could only manage a final 20 minutes, which didn't help, but Landon had only one play on goal. Chris Brown, the other starting forward, was stuck up top all alone for most of his time, vainly tracking down 40 yard passed with his head and no other players in support. Fortunately the Galaxy had crap for energy and creativity themselves. The point does get us out of the division cellar, on goal difference with the Burn, and three matches left: at Colorado, Kansas City and at Dallas.<br /></p>
