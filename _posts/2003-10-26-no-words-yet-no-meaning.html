<p>As usual with this irregular department, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2003/10/25/opinion/26OPART.html">today's Op-Art graphic</a>, crafted by Steven J. Newman, is utterly incomprehensible. I applaud the Times' Editorial Page editors for their attempts to move beyond the strictly linear and literal but wonder just what commentary we are intended to take away from such work.</p>
