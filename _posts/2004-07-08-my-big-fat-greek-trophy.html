<p>Just finished watching FSW's replay of Sunday's Euro2004 championship match which ended, of course, with Greece lifting on the only goal of the game on a sweet header from their scoring leader Charisteas. Or maybe not so sweet, looked perhaps like another Greek player was holding back Portugal's keeper so he couldn't get to the ball first though no one made a big fuss during or after the game.</p>
<p>Did Greece deserve the win? I thought the hosts played a much more aggressive match and had most of the offense. But the visitors' defense was rock-like and the few shots Portugal had were either off-target or not difficult, I don't recall a single really tough save by Nikopilidis. And Greece, bottom line, scored the only goal. <em>Congratulations!</em></p>
