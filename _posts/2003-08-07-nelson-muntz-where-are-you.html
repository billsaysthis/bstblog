<p>Darrell Issa spent over a million dollars of his own money to get the Gray Davis recall vote only, in the end, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A29341-2003Aug7.html">to drop out</a> before he ever got started, overshadowed by the Terminator. Personally I don't see how Ah-nuld could be elected governor of California, though stranger things happen every day, and I would bet that something (or numerous things) <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/archives/003710.html#003710">will come out</a> of his closet to bite him in the ass.</p>
