<p><strong>Understanding our allies in the War on Terror</strong></p>
<p>I have often cited Steven Denbeste, Captain of USS Clueless, in recent months for his masterful analysis of curent events. But in <a href="http://denbeste.nu/entries/00001478.shtml">this far from Clueless mini-essay</a>, he takes a close-up view of our European and Arab allies. First he debunks the current mouthings of some sadly mistaken European ministers (lots of hot air), then he looks at the material contributions from other nations in the fighting and whether we could have succeeded without them (we could, although Pakistan and Britain's assistance was quite useful), before concluding with a piquant note on the Europeans' realization that "Europe is no longer the center of the universe."</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://denbeste.nu/entries/00001494.shtml">second post</a>, based on a poll just done for The Washington Times and ABC, Steven explains how little Americans care about European attitudes towards our foreign policy and the strong probability that NATO will whither away from (U.S.) neglect.</p>
