<p>Of course we're all very sad that David Letterman is stuck at home recovering from shingles but Elvis Costello was really good subbing for him last night. Very funny, topical monologue, showing that good writers can make anyone with a little smooth funny, and a terrific vamp on <a href="http://www.lyrics.net.ua/song/73991">Allison</a> with the lyrics changed to be "I Want to Be a Talkshow Host." Catrell, strapless dress, va-va-va-voom! <a href="http://www.mitchhedberg.net/">Mitch Hedberg</a>: stoner? Fer sure, dude! Then, when Elvis and the Imposters played, what else but my favorite Power Pop tune ever, <a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/Lyric.nsf/songUnid/25D761B09B30B7CF482568AF0020BCEE">(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding</a>, total happiness.</p>
