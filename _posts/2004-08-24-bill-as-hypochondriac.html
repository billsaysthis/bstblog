<p><a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/">Garret</a> linked <a href="http://www.innovations-report.com/html/reports/medicine_health/report-32699.html">an interesting article</a> regarding CFS today, makes me wonder if this is what's causing <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_08_22_blog_archive.phtml#109331068420380309">my condition</a>. Particularly catching my eye was the connection to sore throat, muscle weakness, post-external malaise, sleep and cognitive disturbances and that it's commonly (mis-)diagnosed as depression. Not really sure what myalgias are but a little googling turns up diffuse muscle pain but that doesn't seem like anything bothering me.</p>
<p>Seth, in a comment to Garret's post, suggests a related illness: <a href="http://www.fmnetnews.com/pages/basics.html">fibromyalgia syndrome</a> (FMS), a widespread musculoskeletal pain and fatigue disorder for which the cause is still unknown. Seems a little further from what I'm experiencing but both seem more applicable than the nothing my doctor has got so far.</p>
<p>Still, note the post title I added. As the Big Guy said yesterday, as one gets older one tends to jump to the worst possibility right at the start.<br /></p>
