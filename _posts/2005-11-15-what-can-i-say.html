<p>I know this place has been quiet lately. Honestly there's a lot going on, plus I was sick over the weekend, but mostly behind the scenes stuff. For example, I'm moving this site to a new hosting provider but hitting hiccups after getting put on a new, not quite shaken out, server and just trying to understand what's happening has taken an excessive amount of time.</p>
<p>Also, I've mostly worked through the Rails book and have been obsessively reading the fairly active newsgroup to keep up with things. I even got some help last night from a couple of friendly, more experienced guys to understand how to do a form with a model that doesn't connect  to a database table. With the Thanksgiving holiday and a week off next month there should be something worth showing soon.</p>
<p>Finally, there's all the fan mail. The life of an Internet superstar can have its downside. People expect that I'll actually read their messages and won't take a generic "the check's in the mail" response. No, I have to go into the bank website and literally pay the bill. You tell me, is that any way to treat li'l ol' BillSaysThis?</p>
<p>All in all, keep your fingers crossed. Think a positive thought. Remember to pour the beer down the middle of the glass. Keep on swimming.</p>
