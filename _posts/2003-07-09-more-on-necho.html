<p>Lots of grassroots activity on this new protocol/API/religion. Please note that the affectionate nickname I'm using, (n)Echo, is used simply because the members have yet to come up with the replacement name for Echo and I'm respecting the existing project of that name.</p>
<p>Tristan Louis, a fellow PHP <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&amp;q=acolyte">acolyte</a>, emailed to let me know about <a href="http://www.tnl.net/blog/entry/RSS2Necho">his implementation</a> of an RSS-&gt;(n)Echo converter. Seems like a useful tool at this point, when few blogging engines provide the new format feed natively, and his site allows you to create the conversion as a service or, if one asks nicely, he'll send you some code.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://bitworking.org/rfc/draft-gregorio-02.html">new draft</a> of the API spec has been posted.</p>
<p>Mark, one of the key members of the cabal, has been writing up and linking commentary, so <a href="http://diveintomark.org/">go review</a> his last week or two's worth of posts.</p>
<p>Aaron Schwartz, the teen techno-politician, has created a <a href="http://notabug.com/echonews/">(n)Echo news blog</a>.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm waiting for Luke to add support in <a href="http://www.sharpreader.net">SharpReader</a> before I worry about getting or sending feeds since every currently-available feed also publishes in RSS.</p>
<p>My big hope is that with this system in place and supported by Blogger, I'll be able to get some really nice, not necessarily browser-based authoring tools for my blog. Which, due to slow movement by the home team, don't exist just now.</p>
