<p>A last minute letter to the editor at the Mercury News:</p>
<p>Several times now, when confronted with questionable behavior or choices, Arnold Schwarzenegger has said, literally, "Trust me." Most recently in regard to the sources of the money that will repay his multimillion dollar bank loans but also in response to the accusations that he groped and otherwise sexually harassed numerous women. Why should we trust him? "You know me," Arnold said. And while he has been a public figure for the last 30 years, the public has only had the opportunity to know him as an actor. Someone, that is, who lies for a living. What do we know about the real Arnold? With only three days left until the voting, instead of showing us the answer to that extremely important question, he seems to recede further and further into the distance.</p>
