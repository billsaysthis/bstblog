<p>My Realtor, <a href="http://www.bettychen.com/">Betty Chen</a> is now hosting the Mercury News' <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/classifieds/real_estate/ask_expert_front.htm?forumId=1779">Ask the Expert</a> forum on Saratoga real estate and is activating <a href="http://bettychen.blogspot.com/">her blog</a>. If you're asking, I'd definitely recommend her to anyone looking to buy or sell in the South Bay--she's a ball of energy and got us a better price in less time on the market than two neighbors selling the same units two weeks and two months before us, respectively.</p>
