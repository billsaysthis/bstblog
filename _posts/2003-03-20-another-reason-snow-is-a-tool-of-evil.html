<p>When was the last time you heard of an NHL game being snowed out? This is not, after all, eight year olds playing on a pond in Moose Creek but it <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/news/2003/0319/1526238.html">happened last night</a> to the Sharks. Who get to celebrate by playing three games in three days, something which hasn't occurred in 23 seasons. Snow: forget about sledding, it's a weapon in <a href="http://www.theonering.net/movie/char/sauron.html">the Evil Lord's</a> quiver!</p>
