<p>Everyone knows about the ludicrous version of <em>Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds</em> recorded by William "Capt. Kirk" Shatner back in the late '60s. Bad enough that my beloved Trek was tarnished by Shatner's vocalization. But this morning I heard something even worse. Something that shook me to the core. I'm almost scared to write about it in case I might hear it again in my mind.</p>
<p><a href="http://members.tripod.com/startrekthestore/nimoysings.html">Spock Sings</a>. Yes, Leonard Nimoy, who was never content to play second fiddle even though that was to be his lot in life, also recorded an album in those late, lamented psychedelic days. This being the web, there are even parts available for current day viewing displeasure, such as this QuickTime movie of his <a href="http://www.tolkiencollector.com/bbaggins.mov">song about Bilbo Baggins</a>. On KFOX-FM this morning, Greg Kihn played a bit of the Baggins song, some of <em>Twinkle, Twinkle Little Earth</em> (think of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star with the lyrics reversed), and far too much of Nimoy's take on <em>Proud Mary</em>. I swear I will never be able to listen to the Creedence or Turner versions of that song again without cringing!</p>
<p>Amazon even offers an imported CD featuring "the best" of Shatner and Nimoy together: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000089JE/ref=pd_sim_music_1/104-1311536-2132752?v=glance&amp;s=music&amp;n=507846">Spaced Out: The Best of Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner</a>. For the masochists out there.</p>
<p>Is this another sign that Humanity has just gone too far and should retreat to the caves and trees?</p>
