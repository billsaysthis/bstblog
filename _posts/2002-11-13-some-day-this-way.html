<p>Jesus swings his heavy arm<br />
<br />Sometimes, I wonder in the recesses<br />
<br />Walk, walk with a diamond broach upon your lapel<br />
<br />Turn and talk to the woman on your right.</p>
<p>Take a moment to check a clock<br />
<br />Set it back to front, firmly<br />
<br />Grasp the hand when extended<br />
<br />Listen closely for skittering animals.</p>
<p>Running across the flat slate roof<br />
<br />Soft grey clouds pass along a powdery blue sky<br />
<br />I wonder what the color-blind man sees<br />
<br />Looking up, does he cry?</p>
<p>Tears are fat and wet with salt<br />
<br />Then absorb, pain recedes, recurs, redolent<br />
<br />An interior monologue revisits a childhood<br />
<br />Sadness will find a mate in a fierce, fearsome widower.</p>
<p>A path appears at the edge of a meadow<br />
<br />To one side a red and yellow bird screetches<br />
<br />To one side a green grass snake hisses, slithers, flicks its tongue<br />
<br />Can the color-blind man see the arm waving him on?</p>
