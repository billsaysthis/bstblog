<p>I'm writing this post at the time we're usually at the gym huffing and puffing because, instead, I just got back from dropping TS1 at SFO. She's off to Florida (Tallahussee) to visit her best friend and <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=wedd2&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=vivdewi_exterior.jpg">matron of honor</a> for a few days. The 28--a nickname for the Metaverse's board of directors--didn't help much by blasting Missing You on the ride up!</p>
<p>It feels funny. Any time we've been apart overnight before I'm the one who traveled, to Seattle, Southern California, and staying at a hotel made me feel less strange. Now I'll find out what she felt sleeping in our bed alone. OTOH, the odd feeling could just be the lack of sleep from getting up at 4:30; at least the drive was early enough to miss any traffic on 101.</p>
<p>Ladies, don't get your hopes up--this isn't an invitation of any kind!<span style="font-style:italic;"></span></p>
