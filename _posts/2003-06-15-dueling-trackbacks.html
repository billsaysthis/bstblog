<p>Ever since Ben and Meena came up with the <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/log/trackback/index.shtml">Trackback feature</a> in MovableType, I've been waiting impatiently for Blogger to add it. They haven't even got it in the new Blogger. But <a href="http://kalsey.com/tools/trackback/">Adam Kalsey</a> and <a href="http://www.aylwardfamily.com/content/200306archive001.asp#1055599157001">Kevin Aylward</a> have brought out, on the same day no less, standalone implementations. While neither (just yet at least) has posted the code for others to use, sending the pings only requires filling out a form; I at least want to try it. Hence this entry. (True, the Trotts have posted code for a standalone TB server, not overlooked, but it requires CGI and Perl and I'm not much good with those, or at least too lazy).</p>
