<p><b>Doc gets funny</b></p>
<p>Doc Searls, co-author of <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a> and an often insightful weblog made me break out in laughter <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2001/11/15#slaveryMayBeOkayPrisonersSaybrstudyFindsAcceptanceOnParWithIncarceration">todday</a> with this line:</p>
<p>"Follow plainly unwanted advertising to the limits of wanton self-justification and you arrive at a <em>Fart of Darkness</em> like no other." (Emphasis mine)</p>
<p>Gotta love this stuff. He was discussing the self-serving, not to mention self-deluding, logic of some folks at advertising research firm Dynamic Logic.</p>
