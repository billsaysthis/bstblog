<p><b>And Bayern Munich makes it FIVE!!!</b><br />

<p>This is a little out of the understanding for most Americans, since teams play in one league and then the leagues have their playoffs/championships. College, in most sports, have national championships that roll up the league winners. In soccer, though, there are all kinds of competitions. For top English clubs, there is the regular season (Premiership), the FA Cup, the Worthington Cup, Charity Shield (Premiership winner faces FA Cup winner), the UEFA Cup, Champions League, and Super Cup (one match pitting the Champions League and UEFA Cup winners against each other). There's also a world club championship but it was cancelled this year and apparently won't be played until 2003. <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/europe/news/2001/0824/20010824supercup.html">Reds win 3-2</a> against Bayern Munich to take the Super Cup to cap an amazing run of five of these: FA Cup, Worthington Cup, Charity Shield (their third win over Man United in a row), UEFA Cup and Super Cup. Liverpool must be regarded as one of the top five clubs worldwide.</p>
<p>And it should only get better. Liverpool FC chairman says the team is <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/england/news/2001/0824/20010824lfcvbayernpre.html">aiming for a Super era</a>, and they did get a <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/championsleague/news/2001/0823/20010823lfceuroseeds.html">good draw</a> to help with that. Early voting on Soccernet shows Liverpool as reader favorites to take this year's Champions League. Go Reds!!</p>
