<p><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/11/04.html#a5278">Scoble traces</a> the MSFT wants to buy Google rumors back to a dinner he had a couple of weeks ago with Brin and Page at O'Reilly's Foo Camp. I mean, of course a huge company like Microsoft would choose a guy who can barely keep his mouth shut (though in a good way) to approach such a visible company on M&amp;A business. Of course they would use someone whose job is to get information out to do this. Of course the highly experience executives would have him do it in a meeting where there were 200 or so other people present. Talk about your ROFLs!</p>
