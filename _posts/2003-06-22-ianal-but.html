<p>The three young guys responsible for a disgustingly popular Bum Fights video series were sentenced to a $500 fine, 280 hours of community service, and three years' probation Friday. I couldn't find more detail than the Mercury News had in a brief mention but I don't understand how they got off so lightly--they made a deal to plead guilty to a single count of conspiring to stage an illegal fight. The videos they produced sold <em>only</em> 300,000 copies and also featured homeless men and women performing such entertaining acts as ripping out teeth and ramming themselves into doors.</p>
<p>Let's jut make a conservative guess that these guys (Ryan McPherson, Zachary Bubeck, and Daniel Tanner) made about $7 per video net of production and marketing costs, or about $2.1 million total; not unreasonable conjecture when the tapes and DVDs sold for something like $19.95 each. And in exchange for all the harm they did to the featured players, the DA in San Diego made them cough up a big $1500 without even putting a felony on their records.</p>
<p>I wonder, though, what the police and DA would have done if they came upon two of these poor people fighting over a bottle of alcohol or a nice sleeping bag. Say a knockdown, dragged out affair in a visible location with one of the men really doing damage to the other. Somehow that sounds like the kind of situation where the "winner" would get a real prize: felony assault and one to three years in a state prison.</p>
<p>So Ryan, Zachary, and Daniel ought to thank their lucky stars that business-oriented crimes are seen as <a href="http://www.thesandiegochannel.com/news/1903588/detail.html">much less important</a>, especially when the defendants have some cash to mount a good defense. Fortunately for sanity, these clowns <a href="http://www.thesandiegochannel.com/news/1699306/detail.html">also face civil lawsuits</a> from some of the performers where one can hope they'll have to disgorge their ill-gotten gains.</p>
