<p><b>Stupid people do stupid things</b></p>
<p>Too bad they are such prominent people with so much ability to influence the world and our lives. First, there is the <a href="http://www.doonesbury.com/strip/dailydose/index20010902.htm">ongoing matter</a> of George W. Bush as exemplified by the latest on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/national/AP-US-China.html?searchpv=aponline">China and its nukes</a>. Then there are the people <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/international/AP-Racism-Conference.html">out to ruin</a> the UN World Conference on Racism by turning truth on its head. And, since bad things come in threes, let's end by mentioning those religious zealots running Afghanistan and their <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/international/AP-Afghanistan-Aid-Workers.html?searchpv=aponline">ridiculous persection of foreign aid workers</a>; after all, Afghans have an incredibly high standard of living and don't need charity from anyone else, do they?</p>
