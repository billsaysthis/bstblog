<p><b>Cool pix</b></p>
<p>This is neat, not to mention prizewinning: <a href="http://www.dcmilitary.com/stillserving/3_4/news/9297-1.html">Navy Photographer Snaps 'One in a Million' Photo</a>. Lt. j.g. John Gay, who took it said: "You see this vapor flicker around the plane that gets bigger and bigger. You get this loud boom, and it's instantaneous. The vapor cloud is there, and then it's not there. It's the coolest thing you have ever seen." Thanks <a href="http://www.camworld.com/">Cam</a>.</p>
