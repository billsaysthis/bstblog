<p>Just finished watching Monday's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Show</span> with Zell Miller as the guest. As Jon Stewart said in the closing, he and Miller disagree on, well, just about everything. Frankly I expected a bit more of a blow up, a confrontation based on that extreme difference but Stewart decided not to go there. Oh well.</p>
