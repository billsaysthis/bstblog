<p>Props to Sean Hickey, the Head Zookeeper, for getting <a href="http://www.headzoo.com/alinks">aLinks 1.0</a> out the door. Don't miss the <a href="http://www.headzoo.com/alinks_modules">plugin module</a> for <a href="http://www.headzoo.com/modules/rawsugar.zip">RawSugar</a>! aLinks is a free WordPress plugin that takes a set of phrases you commonly use and turns them into links whenever you include them in a post. With the RS module you can make a list of words and phrases which, whenever used in a blog post, are automatically linked to the search for the word/phrase at RawSugar either in your directory or all of RawSugar.  Very cool.</p>
<p>Sean has apparently rebuilt HeadZoo.com using <a href="http://www.cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> in the couple of weeks since we worked together on the module. Beyond being a bit surprised, since the site is all about WordPress plugins, I'm impressed to see that Cake has finally reached a useful state. I remember seeing the initial announcement early last year and trading a few emails with original developer Michal Tatarynowicz before other folks got involved and Michal found himself crowded out of his own project. The project's basic idea is to recreate the magic of Rails in PHP but as far as I'm concerned that isn't possible. Despite this the smart folks carried on anyway, as well they should.</p>
