<p>I suppose that's putting the mildest spin I can on the last few days. Liverpool lost twice, to Arsenal and Charlton, and the Quakes could do no better than a scoreless draw. Houllier has got to be a goner if the Reds slip from the fourth position (and last qualifying spot for the 2004-05 Champions League) and I'm really wondering what other changes will be seen over the Summer at Anfield. Reports are that French striker Cisse is a sure thing to come on board, probably pushing Heskey into a transfer, but we have to have something new in central defense next season as neither Henchoz nor Biscan seem to have an answer. Overall Liverpool seems to be about the worst fourth place team in the (short) history of the EPL.</p>
