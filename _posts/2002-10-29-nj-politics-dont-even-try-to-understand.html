<p>As <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/">Karl</a> says, I used be from there. My parents still live there, outside Princeton. I gave trying to explain why there is no such thing as an <a href="http://pro2.blogger.com/blog_form.pyra?blogid=2791351&amp;id=3389455">honest politician</a> in the state long ago, though I don't know how different any other state is in this regard; probably <a href="http://pro2.blogger.com/blog_form.pyra?blogid=2791351&amp;id=8719091">fairly similar</a>. Still today's headlines hit home: the County Executive of Essex County, where I grew up, <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/ny-bc-nj--treffinger-profil1028oct28,0,3412691.story?coll=ny-ap-regional-wire">was indicted today</a> on some serious corruption charges. Of course, Treffinger came to office in 1995 as a corruption-busting Republican, after his Democrat predecessor, Thomas D'Alessio, was convicted on federal corruption charges.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/28/nyregion/metrocampaigns/28CND-TREF.html?ex=1036472400&amp;en=91882a94dcde0906&amp;ei=5062&amp;partner=GOOGLE">According to the New York Times</a>, "In the last two years, the United States attorney's office in Newark has obtained convictions of more than 20 public officials. Most of the investigations began independently but have come to intertwine, officials say." Just shocking, eh?</p>
