<p>I 'met' <a href="http://caterwauling.com/blog/">Dawn</a> online while handling some support issue on the Blogger mailing list, we traded some friendly email, and since then monitor her blog. Let me tell you, if I was single and living near D.C., she would be high on my Have to Date list.  (Note to TS1: this is just hypothetical.) She prints on her homepage buttons that say "Oral Sex: Donations accepted" and a Virginia license plate mockup that says "GR8 LAY". But best of all is <a href="http://caterwauling.com/blog/2003_06_01_caterwauling_archive.html#105700119477881079">language like this</a>:</p>
<p><em>"I found myself feeling incredibly horny today. Seriously, today is one of those straddle-anything-that-moves days. Unfortunately, that turned out to be a lively piece of plastic, but still -- it was something. :) Something about this heat brings out the sex-starved, raving lunatic in me."</em></p>
<p>Are you single, smart, attractive guy living in her area? Get your ass in gear!</p>
