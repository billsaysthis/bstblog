<p>Today I saw something that really made me wish I had a <a href="http://jenett.org/jenett/002754.shtml">cameraphone</a>. On the way back from Office Depot I had the good fortune to be driving behind a maroon mid-80s Dodge K car for several blocks. The rear deck (or whatever you call the surface behind the back seat of a sedan, inside the window) was filled from side to side with two or three inch high plastic figures. All colors, types and desciptions. Making it even better, the driver had long frizzy hair standing straight out from his head that Don King only dreams of having. I think he's kept the car all this time just for those figurines!</p>
