<p>I'm thrilled that Google is <a href="http://buzz.blogger.com/2006/08/blogger-in-beta.html">finally releasing an update to Blogger</a> that adds serious new features, not that infrastructure improvements are nice but, face it, Blogger is so far behind other platforms it stopped being funny a year ago. I was even happy to see I was invited to beta test the new version.</p>
<p>But... the beta currently doesn't work for users who have Pro accounts and publish via FTP to their own server (i.e., not a BlogSpot blog). Raise your hand if you have a Pro account. Raise your hand if you publish to your own server.</p>
<p>(Both my hands are up and nose-typing is really slow!)</p>
<p>One of the skills Google has certainly mastered is databases, in pretty much all the different forms they can be made these days. My meaning? Shouldn't the G Men and Women be holding off the invites for folks like me until they resolve the problems blocking these uses? The information is readily available in the blog settings.</p>
<p>While I could create a new blog just to test with, frankly I'm not that interested in using my time that way. This wouldn't be a big deal or worth it to me to write about except that I just wasted 10 minutes trying to log in after clicking the invitation page link to NOT skip for now.</p>
<p>One of the changes in the new system is that everyone will need to use a Google account, and the old Blogger ones will go away. (Didn't Yahoo just have this headache over Flickr?) Again, no big deal except that I use the personalization features of Google News and so am signed in for that as well. I use <a href="http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=41971">the browser Google recommends</a> so I can have multiple tabs open all the time. UH OH, cookie conflict.</p>
<p>In fact, I'm kind of nervous that since I just logged in to News in another tab this post won't get published when I hit the orange button. Better take a copy, just in case.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">After Publish:</span> Glad to report no issues with the push. Still, one would really hope the folks at the 'Plex could have done a tad more testing before pushing this beta out.</p>
