<p><b>Mr. Consolidation visits the database market</b>
<p>C|Net is reporting that <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-5705678.html?tag=mn_hd">IBM will purchase the Informix database unit</a> for $1 billion. IBM plans to continue marketing and development of the product, giving them a two pronged path. Having lived through this scenario when Sun bought NetDynamics and then partnered with AOL on iPlanet, I have serious doubts that this will do anything but hurt IBM. The biggest questions will be:</p>
<p>- Customer uncertainty, regardless of IBM statements, that Informix will continue to be supported and enhanced; and,</p>
<p>- Salesforce uncertainty over which product to sell, especially (but not only) to new customers. If they stop selling Informix to new accounts, eventually the business will wither away.</p>
<p>All in all, while initial <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010424/tc/tech_ibm_informix_dc_4.html">analyst</a> <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/oo/010424/56262.html">reaction</a> is positive, I doubt this will be sucessful.</p>
