<p>As usual <a href="http://sportsfilter.com">SportsFilter</a> is having <a href="http://fantasy.premierleague.com/M/table.mc?id=68196">its own league</a>, plus I put my team in Ives Galarcep's <a href="http://fantasy.premierleague.com/M/table.mc?id=212292">SBI league</a> and Michael Romero's <a href="http://fantasy.premierleague.com/M/table.mc?id=187858">Liverpool fans league</a>.
<div></div>
<div>The players I'm launching with are</div>
<div></div>
<div>Goal: Mark Schwarzer/Fullham</div>
<div>Defense: Bret Hangeland/Fullham, Ryan Shawcross/Stoke City, Maynor Figueroa/Wigan</div>
<div>Midfield: Steven Gerrard (Captain)/Liverpool, Frank Lampard/Chelsea, Dirk Kuyt/Liverpool, Jon Obi Mikel/Chelsea</div>
<div>Forwards: Jozy Altidore/Hull, Fernando Torres/Liverpool, Bobby Zamora/Fullham</div>
<div></div>
<div>Subs: Tomas Sorenson/Stoke City, Phil Neville/Everton, Kamil Zayatte/Hull, Michael Turner/Hull</div>
<div></div>
<div>Note that the fantasy rules limit selections to three players per club, one must select two keepers, five defenders, five midfielders and three strikers, and at least three defenders must be played.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Last year I dropped a few slots to 10th in the SpoFi league, mostly due to not having Cristiano Ronaldo as my captain when most others did but as he's on holiday in Spain this should be less of a problem.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I'm hopeful of recovering my 'Champions League' position of two seasons ago as Stevie, El Nino and Dirk bring goals and gold to Anfield!</div>
