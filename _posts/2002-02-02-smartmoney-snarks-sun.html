<p>In the latest <a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/weekendreport/index.cfm?story=20020202">Weekend Report</a>, Smart Money gets all up and nasty on my biz-oys at the old hiz-ouse:</p>
<p style="font-size:80%;">"Starting on Wednesday, Sun Microsystems (SUNW) will torture analysts for three straight days while saying as little as possible about its financial targets. It would much prefer to talk about its plans to be the next EMC (EMC), now that it knows it can't be the next IBM (IBM). Meanwhile, Hewlett-Packard (HWP), and Compaq (CPQ) and Dell (DELL) all plan on being the next Sun, because they can't be the next IBM either. And even IBM hasn't been its old self lately."</p>
<p>Last I looked, no one put a gun to the analysts to make them attend these sessions. Quite the opposite, as their jobs are made much easier with this access to company executives. But hey, journalists got to have something catchy to say, right?</p>
