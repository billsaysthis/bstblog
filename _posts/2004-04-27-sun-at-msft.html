<p>I've been looking through the multitude of case studies Microsoft has posted and came across one that is particularly interesting: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/casestudies/CaseStudy.asp?CaseStudyID=15125">Microsoft TV Information Systems: Hardware Development at Microsoft</a>. This covers some aspects of Microsoft's internal development process but what I found especially interesting is the mention of "[m]ore than 250 Solaris-based servers" right at the start. The white paper was posted in early March, weeks before the historic deal the two companies made to close their legal wrangling, but one does wonder if the approval process took that into account.</p>
