<p>The 64 games finished today with, of course, the Italian Blues beating the French branch of the color. The game was pretty decent, not a complete defensive afternoon, but there are plenty of news sites to dissect the play so I won't go into detail. I'm glad of the result and felt the winners had the better of the play.</p>
<p>I just want to capture my complete mystery, even seven hours later, on why three time World Footballer of the Year and hero of France's 1998 World Cup glory Zinedine Zidane <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/5163528.stm">went nuts</a> only minutes before the end of extra time and got tossed for lowering his head and blasting it into Marco Materazzi's chest. Already commentary is saying this incident, in what is supposedly Zizou's last professional match, will overshadow one of the best careers of this era.</p>
<p>The 2010 tournament in South Africa is only four years away! Just enough time to get the American team shaped up.</p>
