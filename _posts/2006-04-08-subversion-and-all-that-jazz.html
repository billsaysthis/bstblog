<p>Open source project <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> is pretty much the source control system of choice in the Rails world; TextDrive includes it in the shared hosting plan I use. From all I've read it meets and even exceeds the requirements for such a tool so fine by me. Never having had to use any SCM tools in the past, always having been pretty much developing off by myself, getting started isn't simple but the time has come when it must be done.</p>
<p>Installing is brain dead, just unzip the Windows binaries, install the highly recommended <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN client</a>, reboot. Create repository. Import a special trio of directories (trunk, branches, tag). Import the existing Rails project into trunk. Rename the existing project directory. Check out the project. Ooh, look at all the <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/images/ExplorerView1.png">shiny icons in Windows Explorer</a>!</p>
<p>I also installed <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> this morning, finally removed the redundant standalone Ruby and Apache web server installs (<a href="http://instantrails.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl">Instant Rails</a> is better for me, I think) and just need the <a href="http://www.radrails.org">RadRails</a> boys to get 0.6.2 out the door with <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/articles/2006/04/06/rails-1-1-1-fixing-a-slew-of-minors-but-you-must-still-freeze-typo">Rails 1.1.1</a> support and I'm good to go.</p>
<p>Sure, I actually need to write the code but with all these swell, free tools how hard can that be?</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">p.s.</span> I just checked the news at Instant Rails and see they've got an update which, since it includes the very cool Mongrel, I probably need to pull down.</p>
