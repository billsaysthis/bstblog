<p><b>Another AMT horror story but this time, a plan to fight back</b>
<p>Jeff Chou, a Cisco engineer who faces a $2.5M AMT tax bill, is taking his <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/business/center1/tax0414.htm">protest over AMT public</a>. Besides speaking out to the press (and selling everything he owns to pay Uncle Sam), he's launched <a href="http://www.reformamt.org">campaign</a> to push for reform of the Alternative Minimum Tax focusing on <a href="http://zoelofgren.house.gov/AMTTAXRelease.html">HR1487 - Proposed AMT Relief Bill</a>. 1487 is viewed as a low probability for passage this year but, if passed, would eliminate AMT consideration for incentive stock options.</p>
