<p><b>Yesterday's Book: First Contract</b><br />

<p>A new novel by <a href="http://www.crossover.com/~costik/">Greg Costikyan</a>, First Contract is a very funny story of what might happen if aliens contact us and they're hardcore business types. Beside 50% unemployment in the U.S., some of them are really hardcore--like the Grishneg, who enforce contracts with planet-killing seriousness. Definitely recommended.</p>
