<p>Fight the insane predations of INDUCE! My personal take: If this legislation existed in the time of the Revolutionary War, would we have had the Federalist Papers and other important works?</p>

<p>Click the beta tape and join the effort.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Update, 9/14:</span> My assigned time to call just passed and I made two of the three calls. The woman who answered the phone Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi's office told me that since the bill is currently in the Senate and not the House that she would be glad to add a notch to the anti-bill tally and report it to the Congresswoman for consideration if and when it does come to her chamber but that's all.</p>
<p>I had a longer conversation with a very polite woman in Senator Patrick Leahy's office. She did admit that after the first few dozen calls they realized there was something organized going on today but even so, and even though she was clearly getting a sore throat from all the talking, she did listen to what I had to say, answered a few questions and took my name and state down for a list for the senator. She did tell me that Leahy, even though he's co-sponsoring the legislation, is not happy with the current wording; specifically with the way the bill would overrule <span style="font-style:italic;">Betamax</span>, so he is currently working to change this. HEre's hoping!</p>
