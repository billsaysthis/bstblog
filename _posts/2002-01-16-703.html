<p><strong>Radio Userland 8 as a Blogger authoring tool</strong></p>
<p>This post is a test, first of several I expect, to see how I like using <a href="http://radio.userland.com">RU8</a> as an authoring tool in place of/in addition to&nbsp;the others I already use.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Blogger and RU seem to disagree over some formatting so this was hand-edited using the standard Blogger client.</p>
