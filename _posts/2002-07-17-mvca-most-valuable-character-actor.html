<p><a href="http://alwheaties.com/Tony_Todd.html">Tony Todd</a> shows up all over the place. He's had a number of role in various Star Treks including a recurring spot as Worf's brother on Next Generation, the older Jake on Deep Sapce 9, and the Alpha Hirogen on Voyager. When will he be on Enterprise? Two weeks ago I saw him as the Ancient Mariner on Xena. Last night I saw him as the Krypton-infected janitor gone whacko on Smallville. Now I'm watching an old episode of Homicide (an incredible cop show if you get Court TV) and his was the first guest name listed. <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/person-exact?Todd%2C+Tony">Tons of movies</a>, both film and TV. <em>Cool!</em></p>
