<blockquote><span style="font-style:italic;">Thank you for your patience during this process. Providing outstanding service is our top priority at PayPal. Although we didnâ€™t meet your expectations -- or our own -- in the past few days, we look forward to the opportunity to regain your faith in our service.</span>--<a href="http://www2.ebay.com/aw/announce.shtml#2004-10-14142423">Meg Whitman, President and CEO eBay</a></p></blockquote>
<p>So that's it. People and <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=125307&amp;cid=10500173">businesses</a> lose their potentially primary PayPal payment service for up to five days and the best the <a href="http://www.fool.com/News/mft/2004/mft04100802.htm">most powerful American businesswoman</a> can, or will, do is apologize. Wouldn't want to offer some kind of financial remuneration, that would impact the bottom line and imply some ongoing liability. There's a rock solid non-starter. Kind of puts a stick in <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/archives.blah/008079">Matt's idea</a>, until they get much better on reliability.<br /></p>
