<p>Seems like a smart idea to me. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/01/nyregion/01turnpike.html?ex=1259557200&amp;en=2d3b3d60933b9e6d&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">The project</a> would significantly increase the carrying capacity right near where my parents live, so I know the writer isn't kidding in claiming this might be the worst congestion point in the area and that the number of huge warehouses, not to mention new housing developments, are simply exploding.</p>
