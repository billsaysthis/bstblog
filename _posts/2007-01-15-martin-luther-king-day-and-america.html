<p>After reading the excerpt <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/weblog/kmartino/archives/004698.shtml">Karl posted</a> from Dr. King's speech <span style="font-style:italic;">Remaining Awake Through A Great Revolution</span> and Dan's <a href="http://www.danshafer.com/onemind/?q=node/440">brief rumination</a> I feel very sad. To go back 40 years and see that so little has changed, in fact the change there's been has gone in the wrong direction, is truly disheartening.</p>
<p>I can only imagine that the cost per dead terrorist is far higher, even adjusted for inflation, than the $500k King cites from the Vietnam era though I suppose the political achievements are and will be similar. That is, nothing good will come of this adventure, not security nor better lives for the vast majority of Iraqis, Afghanis or Americans.</p>
<p>A friend emailed this link to Dr. King's <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm">I Have a Dream</a> speech, if you want to feel the passion and promise he offered in depth.</p>
