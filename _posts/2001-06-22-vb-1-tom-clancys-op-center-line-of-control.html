<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0425180050/002-6171523-9541634">eighth book</a> in a series created by Tom Clancy and Steve Pieczenk and written by Jeff Rovin, <span style="font-style:italic;">Line of Control</span> takes the National Crisis Management Center into action to prevent a nuclear war between India and Pakistan. The dozen members of Op-Center's Striker military team are en-route to work with India on a secret reconnaissance to find suspected Pakistan nuclear missile sites near disputed Kashmir when a Free Kashmir Movement cell blows up a police station. Oddly, the temple next door and a bus full of Hindu Pilgrims outside explode as well in the next moment. Everything changes and Striker must lead a race through the Himalayas.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how much involvement Clancy has with these books, one of these series he co-created but doesn't write (<span style="font-style:italic;">Net Force</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Politika</span> are the others). Rovin, who was not given authors credit on the first Op-Center novels, does a good job with them. I've read most and while the subject matter does fall into expected Clancy territory, that is where politics meets intelligence meets military, there is less complexity than a typical Clancy novel with it's dozen plus sub-plots and less explanatory digressions. In short, 350-400 pages instead of 1200-1400.</p>
