<p><a href="http://wbloggar.com/">w.bloggar</a> is moving towards v4, this is composed with the beta version. Looks nice, not sure it's enough to get me to use it as the main tool. One nit is immediately visible: Clicking menu options that go to web pages automatically open in Internet Explorer, not the system default browser and given all the foofaraw around IE lately this will probably not be making many people happy. Good to see non-US (and non-European) software developers though!</p>
