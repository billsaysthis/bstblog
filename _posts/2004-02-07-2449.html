<p>BBC America is now showing a classic (1995-96) Rowan Atkinson series called <a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/genre/comedy_games/thin_blue_line/thin_blue_line.jsp">The Thin Blue Line</a>, about an <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112194/">extremely incompetent police squad</a>. It was written by Ben Elton, who also did Atkinson's various <em>Black Adders</em> and <em>Mr. Bean</em>. Just thought you'd like to know.</p>
