<p>Because actions speak louder than words: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/06/arts/06rich.html?ex=1265173200&amp;en=056b2273368da49a&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">The Year of Living Indecently</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/03/opinion/03thu4.html?ex=1265173200&amp;en=829b4654e8fc5e55&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">'Pay to Play' in New Jersey</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/03/opinion/03thu2.html?ex=1265173200&amp;en=2e3e6e50ed8eef56&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">Blaming the Messengers</a>. Ack! Four more years of this and then what? Will the Dems still be wandering in some disconnected wilderness, unable to find the nose one their faces while the Republicans pound out the lies rat-a-tat-tat? I can't recall where I saw it but I read an article a month or three ago which mentioned that there have been people in every age who believed they were living in the Last Days. <a href="http://mb-soft.com/believe/text/millenar.htm">Millenarianism</a>, though the religious component is no longer required IMO. Anyway, there are days when I read about amazing people and wondrous things just around the bend, and then there are the days when I read all this shit and truly wonder why.<br /></p>
