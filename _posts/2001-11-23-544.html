<p><b>Good deal: No PFA strike</b></p>
<p><a href="http://msn.espn.go.com/soccer/news/2001/1123/1283225.html">Players, Premier League reach deal</a> to avert a Football Association strike Dec. 1. We hardly get enough English soccer here as it is and this would have messed up some good matches. Amusing from an American perspective as they were fighting over all of about $15 million, far less than what's at stake in our pro league player negotiations. Heck, Jason Giambi and Barry Bonds will both get more than that per year in their new contracts.</p>
