<p><b>Star Trek V: It's Official</b><br />

<p>TrekToday has a <a href="http://www.trektoday.com/news/110501_01.shtml">detailed report</a> on the <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/010510/lath131.html" title="Official press release">Paramount announcement</a> confirming the series name as Enterprise and  announcing the actors cast in regular roles. As expected, Scott Bakula (star of Quantum Leap) will play Captain Jonathon Archer leading the crew of the Federation Starship Enterprise exploring the galaxy in the late 22nd century. The offical Star Trek website also has <a href="http://www.startrek.com/news/news.asp?ID=119952">the news</a>. Producer Ron Berman says none of the Internet rumored premises is correct but won't say what the correct one really is; current concensus is a series that is largely set as mentioned here with a blend-in of 29th centruy time travel. As an optimist, I have high hopes for this series--could be seven more years of fun!</p>
<p>The story seems to be generating a ton of hits on the TrekToday server, as I can't get back to the page!</p>
