<p>I know Ronald Reagan was a hero to many Americans. Though I disagree, their attitude is no problem, this is the Land of the Free blah blah blah. Talk about adding his visage to Mount Rushmore, fine. Put his picture on the $10 or $20 bill or the dime, well, okay, not a big deal to me.</p>
<p>The California and Federal governments will be spending millions of dollars on security, travel and other arrangements while the ex-President lies in state. Even that seems reasonable.</p>
<p>But the California and Federal governments are running huge deficits and on top of all this will be giving an extra vacation day Friday to all "non-essential" personnel? WTF? How in the world do they justify this huge expense? We don't have enough money to properly fund education and healthcare, to name two massively more important government functions, but the State of California (haven't seen the comparable number for the Feds) is going to spend $60 million on a 15th day off for people, at least 95% of whom will not even spend two minutes remembering the Gipper on this bonus holiday? I repeat WTF?!?!?!</p>
<p>Give me a fucking break!</p>
