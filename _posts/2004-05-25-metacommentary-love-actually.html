<p>We just finished watching <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_11_16_blog_archive.phtml#106900545240338026">Love Actually</a> with the commentary track featuring director Richard Curtis and actors Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy and Thomas Sangster (plays the drummer, Liam Neeson's boy). Chemistry and a good sense of humor really made this enjoyable, probably something I should do with more of the DVDs; also brought out a ton of little factoids. Still, I can't believe the poor reception this terrific film got when it came out, I think it's so funny, sweet, smart and romantic.</p>
