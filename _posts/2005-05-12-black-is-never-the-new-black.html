<p>37signals posts an article pushing back on Google Web Accelerator, <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/google_web_accelerator_hey_not_so_fast_an_alert_for_web_app_designers.php">Hey, not so fast - an alert for web app designers</a>, which was a reaction to the way <a href="http://webaccelerator.google.com/">GWA</a> prefetches even destructive links. Now arguments have been made, pro and con, on how wise it is of Google to do this and for web developers to use GETs instead of POSTs so the functionality is vulnerable to it, I'm not debating which is the best answer. I am sitting here laughing because on the same page as this blog post, 37signals has an add for the book they authored, <a href="http://www.37signals.com/book">Defensive Design for the Web</a>. I personally expect people who write books about defensive design to actually design defensively, don't you?</p>
