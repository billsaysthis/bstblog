<p>Blogger is apparently being hit with a <a href="http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/denial_of_service.html">Denial of Service attack</a>, and has been for the last 24 hours or more. Which is why I had the trouble posting yesterday and into today. Some asswipe probably doesn't like the fact that Pyra sold out to Google, or has some other beef with Google and the Blogger servers are the ones must vulnerable, or something, but whoever's doing it is an asshat and sucks. Way to fight the 3vi1, d00d!</p>
