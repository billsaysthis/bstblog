<p>Finally! I was waiting to find Stross's book in a cheap paperback or at the library and last week good old MVPL came through. Let's just say not only was <a href="http://www.accelerando.org/">Accelerando</a> worth the wait, I was incredibly anxious to see how he resolved the story. Think of three day old peeling sunburn on a hot, sweaty afternoon with no Aloe Vera lotion. LOL--you can <a href="http://www.accelerando.org/2006/03/17#download-2">read it free</a> but for all my geekness reading books on a computer screen isn't comfortable for me.</p>
<p>As in <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/singlepost.php?id=111095193944318669&amp;titl=Singularity%20Sky&amp;sy=review">Singularity Sky</a> Charlie unleashes a blast of technofuturism that I've rarely seen outside of Hamilton or Macleod. This time he takes the idea of the Singularity head on and shows how his characters live through it. While Stross and others have written great books set before and after this so-called Nerd Heaven, <span style="font-style:italic;">Accelerando</span> is the first one I know of that tries to show the event as it happens.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">absolutely recommended</span></p>
