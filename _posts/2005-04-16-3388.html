<p>NBC is putting <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Third_Watch/index.html">Third Watch</a> to sleep after a few more episodes but from the promos being run you'd think this was the proud end of the second coming of, oh, <em>Hill Street Blues</em> rather than the nearly invisible petering out of just another mediocre series. Not to be singling out this show or even NBC because almost every network does it for every show that lasts more than two seasons. And the more times the suits do this, the more annoyed I get.</p>
