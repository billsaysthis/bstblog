<p>From 2001, this is a small English movie that mainly comes across as an author's attempt to disgorge the emotional aftermath of a childhood friendship that spoiled. <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0263725/">Me Without You</a> was written and directed by <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/celebs/bio/celeb/1676581">Sandra Goldbacher</a> (following up her Minnie Driver debut feature, <em>The Governess</em>), though I could be reading more into this than really ought to be. Mark it down as a character study rather than a story film.</p>
<p>Michelle Williams (yes, the blonde from <em>Dawson's Creek</em>) does her best English accent, adds a few pounds and darkens her hair for most of the movie, playing Holly, the slightly mousy next-door neighbor and best friend to <a href="http://www.d-follower.freeservers.com/annafr.jpg">Anna Friel</a>, taking the part of the gregarious, daring and not 100% connected to reality Marina. The only other names are Trudy Styler, Mrs. Sting, as Friel's loopy, slutty mother and Kyle MacLachlan as a college literary theory lecturer who beds both of his students. The film is composed of sequences in five different years--1973, 1978, 1982, 1989 and 2001--showing the growth of the girls and their friendship.</p>
<p><em>Not really recommended unless you want to relive your English '70s and '80s upbringing as a female</em></p>
