<li>Tonight is the last Buffy; I'm sad to see her go but Whedon has done a pretty interesting job so I'll be expecting a huge ending. Not. Reading. Any. Reviews!</li>
<li>Noted SF author Greg Benford posted <a href="http://www.locusmag.com/2003/Reviews/Benford05_Matrix.html">Theological Science Fiction: Why The Matrix Matters</a>, an insightful essay. [<em>via <a href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/sgentile/posts/7277.aspx">Sam Gentile</a></em>]</li>
<li>There's just something different about Mississippi, especially <a href="http://www.thejacksonchannel.com/education/2215667/detail.html">the politicians</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/2003/05/18/automobiles/18BUIC.html">Buick Turns 100, Smoothly</a>: we had a few Buicks when I was growing up but I can't imagine buying one myself, not when their styling is either five years late or just plain weird.</li>
<li>Speaking of cars, <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,58750,00.html">fart-powered fuel cells</a>! If only they could capture my output, as TS1 can testify, there would never be another energy crisis.</li>
