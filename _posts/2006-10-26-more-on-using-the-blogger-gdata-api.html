<p>I've been working closely with <a href="http://ngoprekweb.ngikutin.com/">Eris</a> all week on moving his new class library to production quality, and he's now put out v0.1. Its been really enjoyable, not the least because he's very open to my feedback and code suggestions. If you're still using the <a href="http://www.dentedreality.com.au/bloggerapi/">class library</a> that Beau Lebens and I put together <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_02_03_blog_archive.phtml#9389656">a few years back</a> I highly recommend you grab this and start moving your code over. While your client code will definitely change you should be able to keep all existing functionality.</p>
