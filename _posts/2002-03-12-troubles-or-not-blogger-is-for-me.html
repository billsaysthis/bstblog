<p>Lately, <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> has been having some serious down time and performance weirdness. Just so the non-bloggers of you understand, the authoring/publishing part of the blogger system runs on Pyra Labs servers; as <a href="http://denbeste.nu">Steven</a> pointed out, this is a single point of failure from which other personal publishing systems that run on one's own system are not subject. In practical terms, this means that I cannot publish when the Blogger servers are down. The last few days have had a serious bout of the outties when Ev and Jason began upgrading the servers. Hopefully, the worst is past. Being a careful, thoughtful guy (stop laughing!), I investigated a couple of the alternatives, <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a> and <a href="http://cafelog.com/">b2</a>. Let's just say I spent several hours on each and neither comes close to what I get in Blogger. Movable Type is probably closer but I couldn't get all the way there. Oh well. <a href="http://www.evhead.com">Ev</a>, I'm counting on you!</p>
