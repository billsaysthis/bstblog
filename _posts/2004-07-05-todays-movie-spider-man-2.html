<p>Was looking forward to <a href="http://www.spider-man2.com/">Spider-Man 2</a> since walking out of the theater <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_04_28_blog_archive.phtml#85059282">two years ago</a>. Was I satisfied? Not as much as many others were to judge from the newspapers and blogs though it was okay. I still have a bit of trouble with Tobey Maguire as an action hero (can't wait for a buff, goateed <a href="http://bladetrinity.com/" title="Click the All Hail King link">Ryan Reynolds</a>) and at 29 he's getting a bit old to play a 20 year old anyway.</p>
<p>My biggest complaint is that the picture overall lacks coherence, that director Sam Raimi wasn't able to ride herd on the posse of producers, cast and studio execs with their endless notes and suggestions. The bits and pieces seem jammed together, not seamless as they ought to. Example: after the subway fight, Spidey is laying flat on the floor and the camera dives into the insignia on his chest to transition to the next scene, a common enough device but to be effective it needs to be used throughout the movie not just the one time. And couldn't someone have sent Alfred Molina a personal trainer so he wouldn't look flabby during his shirtless scenes?</p>
<p><em>recommended</em>, good but not great</p>
