<p>Why, why <a href="http://breakingnews.iol.ie/entertainment/story.asp?j=128415752&amp;p=yz84y6458">is this</a> news? Are we not taking the cult of celebrity too far when even the christening of celebrity children is worthy of <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/hi/news/5033944.html">reportage</a>? <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/?p=5486">Garret</a> and <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/weblog/kmartino/archives/003641.shtml">Karl</a> have much more important stories to share but finding their kind of stories are judged far less interesting by editors everywhere, unless it can be fitted into <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/nyregion/nyregionspecial/index.html">self-promoting</a> <a href="http://www.mercurynews.info/wishbook/">campaigns</a>. We received some gift cards as holiday presents and, in honor of these two fine bloggers, will be buying a winter coat and some food to donate.<br /></p>
