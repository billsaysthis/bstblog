<p>Germany's Spiegel has posted a very interesting <a href="http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/spiegel/0,1518,340395,00.html">Interview with Bill Gates</a>. The magazine's interviewer takes a very strong tone with his questions, much more so than we see in American media, but BillG keeps his cool and stays on message thoughout. The article was originally published in German and then (I suppose) translated to English and I wonder if some of the impression is an artifact of the translation; when I hear Germans speaking English there often seems to be a similar harshness. Still, an interesting read. [<em>via <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/05/02/06/1556209.shtml?tid=109">/.</a></em>]</p>
