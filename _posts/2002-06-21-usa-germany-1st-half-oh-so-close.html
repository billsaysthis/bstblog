<p>For 38 minutes, the Americans were giving the German players as much as they could, with five shots against one, forcing the German keeper Kahn to make three quality saves. The marking was tight but fair, no cards shown. Then, quickly, off a direct kick from Christian Ziege, Michael Ballack led a rush into the American box, got the ball on his head, and knocked it just to the right of Brad Friedel and in for the 1-0 lead. Landon Donovan, playing forward alongside McBride in an unusual for USA 3-5-2 lineup, has had the chances for us but Kahn showed hy he is the world's best.</p>
