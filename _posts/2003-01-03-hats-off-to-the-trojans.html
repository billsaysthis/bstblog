<p>Just finished watching the Orange Bowl and saw my alma mater USC just destroy the allegedly superior Iowa Hawkeyes 38-17. The game started off looking bad--Iowa ran the opening kickoff back for a touchdown--but USC marched right back for an answering score. After trading field goals the rest of the first half, the Trojans took charge right from the start of the third quarter, scoring 28 unanswered points before giving up a garbage touchdown with 34 seconds left in the game. Carson Palmer versus Brad Banks? Palmer went 21 of 31 for 304 yards and a touchdown versus 15 of 36 for 206 yards and one touchdown and one interception for Banks, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=230020030">not even close</a> considering that 80 of Banks' yards came on that <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=230020030">last drive</a>.</p>
