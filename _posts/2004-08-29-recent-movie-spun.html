<p>Life for this crew is all about the junk, the stuff you shoot into your veins, snort when necessary. Tell yourself you're not addicted, that you can stop on a dime whenever that day comes. No problemo. Anyone who isn't an addict can see immediately that self-deception of these people.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="http://www.spunthemovie.com/spun/main.html">Spun</a> is essentially an attempt at an American version of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/">Trainspotting</a> but director Jonas Ackerlund doesn't come close to the humanizing success Danny Boyle had with that film. Depending on Mickey Rourke for a major role is a good predictor, I'd say, and trampling too many storylines on top of each other is another. Ackerlund's done some terrific work with music videos but not here.</p>
<p><em>don't bother</em><br /></p>
