<p>The latest email from the Bruce Springsteen mailing list (that is, the announce-only official list) pointed to his new video, <span style="font-style:italic;">American Land</span>, which for now is exclusively available though cable net CMT's website. Cool, so I clicked over to give a look.</p>
<p>Yet when I clicked the video link I saw a big blank space and this annoying message:<br />
<blockquote><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/we_are_sorry.jpg" />
<div style="font-style:italic;">In order to offer a broad selection of full-length music videos on-demand and free of charge, CMT Loaded uses Windows Digital Rights Management (DRM) to protect videos from unauthorized re-distribution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Microsoft's Windows Media Player Plug-in for Macintosh does not support Windows DRM. If DRM support becomes available for Macintosh, CMT will develop a version of CMT Loaded that works on a Mac.</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Bruce, you have got to be kidding me. Mr. Blue Collar, man of the people, and yet you're bent out of shape at the possibility fans may take a copy to keep or pass on to other fans? I can't watch the new video because I have a MacBook and OS X doesn't support the "digital rights management" that you and/or your management feel is needed to preserve his financial interests?</p>
<p>Bruce, you've been my favorite musical act since 1974 and I've splashed out plenty of money over 32 years on records, CDs, DVDs, concert tickets, shirts, hats and books; for you and/or your people to block me from watching a freely available video is just sad.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Later:</span> Just came across Bob Lefsetz's <a href="http://www.rhino.com/rzine/StoryKeeper.lasso?StoryID=410">entertaining, angry essay on Springsteen</a> on the Rhino Records website, which is his response to <a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/albums/devils.html">Diamonds &amp; Dust</a>. Let's just say that though Bob--a highly-respected music industry analyst--was a fan early on he didn't take well to Springsteen's post-<a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/albums/tomjoad.html">Ghosts of Tom Joad</a> releases (though no mention of <a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/albums/tracks.html">Tracks</a>, not clear where that might fit in to his thinking). A very enjoyable read nonetheless.</p>
