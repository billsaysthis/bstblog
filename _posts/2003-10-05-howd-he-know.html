<p>Conspiracy nutjobs sometimes turn their surreal gaze towards pro sports. Claiming, for instance, that the games are scripted, at least in their outcomes. The effort involved in doing so for only the major sports (NFL, MLB, NBA), even given the huge amounts of betting taking place, doesn't seem to be justified--how would you keep the secret year after year with so many thousands of individuals involved? Nevertheless, listening to Dick Enberg's play-by-play during the opening drive of today's Raiders/Bears game and proclaiming that a first down was made several steps before it appeared obvious to me, the thought did come to mind. Then again, the Raiders do exist only in <a href="http://www.kingfeatures.com/features/comics/bizarro/about.htm">Bizarro Universe</a>.</p>
