<p>Contrast: <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/06/19.html#a7812">Scoble</a> vs. <a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2004/06/the_disruption_.html">JRobb</a>. Somehow I'm thinking we (and by we I mean relatively well off Americans and Western Europeans) might be much better in the long run by putting immediate and harsh focus on what's really happening in the Middle East. I don't mean make sure we <a href="http://electionimpact.votenet.com/declareyourself/index.cfm">get out and vote</a>, though that's an important task, but figure out how as individuals we can do something meaningful to avoid the JRobb scenario. Hint: emailing, calling or writing a politician is unlikely to be sufficient either.</p>
<p>Must. Think. Harder!</p>
