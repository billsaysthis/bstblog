<p><b>Today's book: Section 31: Rogue</b></p>
<p>The second of four <a href="http://www.psiphi.org/cgi/upc-db/feature/section-31.html">Section 31 books</a> (and for a change really worth packaging into separate books), <a href="http://www.psiphi.org/cgi/upc-db/0671774778.html">Rogue</a> shows us a Next Generation mission where Picard and Data, of the regulars, are called in to clean up when a Section 31 mission goes off the rails, on a strange planet whose populace is about to vote on whether to join the Federation or the Romulan Star Empire. Seems Section 31 wants them to join the Romulans, part of a deal with the Tal Shiar, but the Romulans have a little something extra up their sleeves. Picard and Data, along with First Contact's Lt. Hawk (the first openly gay Star Trek character as far as I can remember), must foil the dastardly plans at great peril to themselves; <a href="http://www.maximumwarp.co.uk/8pic19.jpg">Hawk</a> is the poor bastard in the film who goes with <a href="http://www.startreklibrary.com/MOVIES/first-contact3.htm">Worf and Picard</a> out onto the Enterprise's deflector shield and is assimilated and then killed by Worf. Cronan Thompson wrote a <a href="http://ducttape.simplenet.com/cronan/stfc.html">Mystery Science Theater version of the movie</a>, quite funny.</p>
<p>This adventure is mainly set six months before <a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Contrib/SciFi/StarTrek/STTNG/firstcontact.html">First Contact</a>--it takes only a few days to unfold--but is wrapped in a post-First Contact prologue/epilogue for some reason. Decent pacing and good characterization for the non-regular characters.</p>
