<p><b>Sum 41: punk rock's Backstreet Boys?</b></p>
<p>Never heard of <a href="http://www.sum41.com/">these clowns</a> before but saw them on <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/episode_guide/10.html">Saturday Night Live</a> just now. What's with the bouncing and the "you take three words, I'll take the next three" vocals? I guess 25 years after the Clash rocked Brixton, we're just as likely to get commercialized punk bands as anything else. But did the audience at SNL have to go quite so wild? Dayum!</p>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="http://www.saturday-night-live.com/snl/news/2000/february/life-after_chase.html">Chevy Chase</a> showing up on the <a href="http://mypage.uniserve.ca/~divten/sounds/Update.htm">Weekend Update</a> segment as the Land Shark was great, excellent use of the tons of comic history SNL has made.</p>
