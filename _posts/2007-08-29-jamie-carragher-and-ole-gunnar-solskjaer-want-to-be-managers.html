<p>What other conclusion are we to draw from Carra's attire at today's Champions League delousing of Toulouse at Anfield? There he was, sitting in the stands with fellow injured listee Steven Gerrard wearing a proper suit and tie while Stevie had on a simple collared shirt under a sweater watching the 4-0 drubbing his teammates gave the third place French side to advance to the group stage.</p>
<p>Rafa threw out a pretty makeshift side with Pepe Reina, Dirk Kuyt, Daniel Agger and John Arne Riise the only regulars starting. Arbeloa made another decent showing, this time at right back, and Sami Hyypia was recalled to take Carragher's spot, with Agger getting the last bit off after Steve Finnan came on for him. The midfield was all new look, with Yossi Benayoun, Javier Mascherano, Momo Sissoko and Sebastian Leto from right to left; Leto and Sissoko were subbed off in the second half by Ryan Babel and Leiva Lucas. Crouchie got a start up top with Kuyt.</p>
<p>Goals came from:
<ol>
<li>Crouch, who toe-poked in a cross from Kuyt to the near-side in the 19th</li>
<li>Hyypia, heading in Benayoun's corner minutes into the second half</li>
<li>Kuyt, from a give and go with Babel, and,</li>
<li>Kuyt again, just before the end of regulation getting a foot to the ball milliseconds before the keeper could claim it off a very nice Benayoun pass</li>
</ol>
<p>So 5-0 on the aggregate with the Reds showing early in the season the summer additions have given us options and depth to handle the very full schedule. I wouldn't be shocked to see a seasoned central defender purchased before Friday's deadline, but then again perhaps not after seeing Riise shift into the middle after Agger was substituted. John Arne is clearly a versatile player but does he have the stay at home defensive quality required of a center back?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</span></p>
<p>Though I'm not any sort of a Man United fan, I've been an Ole fan ever since his wonder goal capped the Red Devils comeback to win the 1999 Champions League final. That and his boyish face and always positive play. The last few years had to have been miserable for him with multiple longterm injuries reducing him to spot play and late substitute minutes, and the hurts took their toll as Solskjaer announced his retirement today at 34.</p>
<p>In 11 years with the team, the Norway man scored 126 goals in 366 appearances for the club. That's a pretty amazing rate when you consider that he had to take what was left over behind Ruud van Nistlerooy, Wayne Rooney, Eric Cantona, Ryan Giggs and the rest of the stellar cast at Old Trafford. He had 11 goals last season, several of which were crucial in helping ManU to the league title and FA Cup runner-up spot.</p>
<p>Anyway, the striker is staying with the team as a coach and ambassador, and one would expect him to study for his managerial license as well. Good luck, Ole!</p>
