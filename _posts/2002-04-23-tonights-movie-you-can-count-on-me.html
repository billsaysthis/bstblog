<p>Turns out that Matthew Broderick has one of the leads in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0203230">You Can Count on Me</a> because he was high school buddies with writer/director Kenneth Lonergan, how's that for a juicy tidbit! Okay, this is Lonergan's first major film and getting someone of Broderick's history probably helped more with getting the financing. This is an odd little film that had a lot of critical acclaim and got nominated for a lot of awards so I figured to give it a shot. Can't really recommend it to others unless you like really small scale character studies where the characters undergo almost no growth at all. None of the actors give all that exciting performances although Laura Linney comes closest in what I suppose is the lead role.</p>
