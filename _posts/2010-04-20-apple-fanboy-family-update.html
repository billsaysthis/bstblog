<p>A couple of years ago I posted that TS1 and I <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/blog/2008/03/were-an-apple-fanboy-family/">had become true Apple converts</a>. Since then I've gotten a MacBook Pro (parting gift when I left Aptana) and we got my dad's Mini when he decided to go back to Windows. The Mini is our entertainment computer, hooked up to the living room big screen, which let us get rid of the DVD player.</p>
<p><strong>Hat tip:</strong> LogiTech makes a very nice, free iPhone app called <a href="blog.logitech.com/2010/01/29/new-logitech-touch-mouse-turns-your-iphone-or-ipod-touch-into-a-wireless-trackpad-and-keyboard">TouchMouse</a> so the phone can be used as wireless mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>We've resisted buying matching iPads. So far.</p>
<p>One other thing we bought some time ago was some Apple stock and that's the reason for today's post. The company just released their Q2 numbers and they blew the doors off expectations. Stock was down a little in regular trading--normal the day earnings are announced--but in after hours trading it shot up about 6% to $260. Probably won't open at much over $250 tomorrow but still awesome.</p>
