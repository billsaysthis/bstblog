<p>Why am I not surprised that country singer Faith Hill has a featured role in the coming comedy remake of The Stepford Wives (<a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movies/feature/thestepfordwives.html">teaser trailer</a>, which is a faux ad much like the one for <a href="http://www.irobotnow.com/index.php">I, Robot</a>)? She is probably a nice enough person, certainly I've never met her and cannot comment on that, but between her perfect marriage to fellow singing star Tim McGraw and perfect children and her so good she looks manufactured appearance, it's almost satirical that she's been cast as the perfect robotic wife in this film.</p>
