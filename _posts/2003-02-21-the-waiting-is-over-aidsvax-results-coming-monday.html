<p>Three days from now, an event for which I've been waiting over three and a half years will finally happen: Vaxgen <a href="http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=VXGN&amp;script=410&amp;layout=-6&amp;item_id=384961">will announce</a> the results of the Phase III clinical trials for the AIDSVAX vaccine Monday morning. Before the market opens, at 6:00 a.m., and you can listen in (instructions in the linked page).</p>
<p>I had a feeling that the announcement would be sooner rather than later (Vaxgen announced late last year that this news would be forthcoming in this quarter), and made a last minute bet that the results will be positive. Already holding 1600 shares of stock, I added 16 contracts for March $15 call options! Kind of like pressing your bet at the craps table, but if the vaccine works my payoff will be turbocharged and, if not, well I was already betting plenty and this won't make too much of a difference to the downside.</p>
<p>Most important, the results should be good so that we can start taking proactive steps to fight this disease that's killing so many people all over the world. Kudos to Drs. Donald Francis, Lance Gordon, Philip Berman, and the rest of the team for over seven years of hard work.</p>
