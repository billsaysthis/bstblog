<p>Just had an annoying little episode with billsaysthis.com. I'm playing with a beta of some PHP software that suggests using <a href="http://www.aallnet.org/support/password.asp">.htaccess</a> to password protect a particular directory. Only I was a little to quick with the enter key at one point and overwrote the .htaccess file in the webserver's root document file (the one which serves up the homepage) and KA-BOOM! no more pages served here. Of course I had no backup and couldn't remember the stupid <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/configuration.directives.php">include file syntax</a> either. How annoying!</p>
