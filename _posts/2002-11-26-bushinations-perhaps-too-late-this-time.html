<p>One can never tell what may happen with technological discoveries and developments that threaten entrenched economic interests. Even more so when the interests are as politically powerful as the energy companies currently stand. Add in a stark ideological wall demonstrated by the way the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission dealt with the State of California during the energy crisis of 2000-2001. Any proposition that goes against these companies faces a hard, hard path.</p>
<p>No reason, then, to be surprised by last Friday's announcement by the Environmental Protection Agency that the New Source Review program was being cancelled. New Source Review ensures that power generation plants do not use a very large loophole in the original (1972) Clean Air Act to increase the pollution produced by expanding these plants instead of building new ones. The power companies have been trying to get rid of it for years and now that the Republicans are safely ensconced in power, the companies got their wish. Paul Krugman provides <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/26/opinion/26KRUG.html">an excellent analysis</a> of these shenanigans in today's Times.</p>
<p>However, <a href="http://www.spacedaily.com/news/solarcell-02m.html">a recent scientific discovery</a> at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory may make this advantage, and the corresponding ecological damage, short-lived. A group of Materials Science researchers have found that indium nitride has slightly different electrical properties than previously thought and as a result likely makes possible extremely efficient, low cost solar power cells. That is, economically viable use of solar power on a very large scale. The very thought gives me shivers--consider the economic and environmental implications here, which are simply staggering!</p>
<p>A friend, though, raises the point that I mentioned in the opening of this entry. How will the very powerful, very rich, very entrenched companies clearly threatened by such a massive dislocation respond? Will they be able to use their money and connections to stiffle this change?</p>
