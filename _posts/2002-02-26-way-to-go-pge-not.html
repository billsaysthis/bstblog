<p>This is the age of the Internet, no? And Pacific Gas and Electric is the home team energy supplier, yes? So how come these idjits can't post <a href="http://search.pge.com/query.html?qt=outage">outage information</a> on their website? My power was out for two plus hours this morning. A call to the automated information line says they are experiencing a system failure and restoring power might not occur until 2:00. Not great but no big deal. I headed over to the wonderful <a href="http://library.ci.mtnview.ca.us/">Mountain View Public Library</a> to use their PCs and internet access, thinking I would check for details and also to see when power is actually restored. But no, they don't actually publish this information! Hey, if the automated phone system has the data, there's no way that piping it to the website would be difficult. By the way, did you know that the MV Library allows folks to bring their own laptops and hook into the network? Next time for sure I'll be bringing my own rather than use the crippled old machines they have.</p>
