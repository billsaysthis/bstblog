<p>The following is a letter sent to Michael Vizard, the editor of InfoWorld:</p>
<p>"Just curious but do you guys ever get positive comments on the excessive, obsessive dictionary-like linkage in the articles online? For example, I was reading Chad Dickerson's CTO Connection column <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/op/xml/02/04/01/020401opconnection.xml">The unsung heroes</a> and noticed the phrase software development is linked to the same javascript popup window six times. In case my sarcasm isn't heavy enough, I'm suggesting that myself and probably most other readers would prefer that this be changed. Perhaps a glossary at the end of articles? This practice gets particularly confusing when the term is part of a longer one, such as the title of the book in this article, and one might reasonably expect the link to resolve to a page about the book."</p>
<p>Even though three weeks have passed, Mr. Vizard has not replied. Isn't that just rude?</p>
