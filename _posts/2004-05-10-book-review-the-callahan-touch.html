<p><a href="http://www.spiderrobinson.com/index.html">Spider Robinson</a> is an old favorite, especially for his Callahan's Saloon stories that go back over 25 years. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0441001335/qid=1084159622/sr=12-27/103-7429778-3851856?v=glance&amp;s=books" title="Amazon link but I really couldn't find anything better">The Callahan Touch</a>, originally released in 1993, is the sixth of ten in the series.</p>
<p>Robinson is a master of the punning art and he shows it off throughout this tale. If you haven't read any of the previous books, however, I'm not sure you'll really get as much enjoyment from <em>Touch</em> as I did. Most of the characters are well worn, old friends that I'm meeting again and know well.</p>
<p>Although in science fiction aliens are not, of course, unusual, in the Earth of these set in the present stories they're as unknown as in reality but several make appearances here as do a <a href="http://www.shee-eire.com/Magic&amp;Mythology/Fairylore/Cluricaunes/page%201.htm">cluricaune</a>, a half Far Darrig/half Pooky and a talking dog.</p>
<p><em>recommended to Callahan fans</em></p>
