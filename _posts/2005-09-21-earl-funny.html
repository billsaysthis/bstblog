<p>I'm not surprised that <a href="http://nbc.com/My_Name_Is_Earl/">My Name Is Earl</a> made me laugh. After all, Earl is played Jason Lee and he's made me <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120655/">laugh</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118842/">many</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705/">times</a>. But the show comes from the guy who gave us the craptacular <em>Yes, Dear</em> so that about evened things out. Trust me, this is no <em>Yes, Dear</em>, after one episode that is extremely clear. Politically incorrect, self-effacing, direct, the running Carson Daly joke and a couple of hotties in the mix.</p>
