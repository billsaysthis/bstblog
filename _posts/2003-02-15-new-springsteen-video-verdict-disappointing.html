<p>In the run up to the Feb. 28 TV special, the Springsteen camp has released a new video of <a href="http://channels.netscape.com/ns/wrap/linker.jsp?floc=MU-EV-GRAMMY-SL1&amp;ref=http://demand1.stream.aol.com/ramgen/aol/us/aolmusic/artists/sony/brucespringsteen/brucespringsteen_waitinonasunnyday_nb.rm">Waiting on a Sunny Day</a>. Not really a video, more like a bunch of nice shots, none more than a few seconds long of Bruce and the band playing over the live version of the song. Which is a terrific song, but just judging the video as a video, I'm disappointed. Lots of shots of Bruce smiling, waving to the crowd, congratulating the band. Really does nothing for me. Too bad.</p>
