<p>No! Rivaldo ties the match off a Ronaldinho run well into injury time. Seaman made a valiant attempt with a dive to his right but the ball was too well placed. Chalk this against Beckham, who had pushed way into the Brazilian half and couldn't get back to help stop the counterattack. And perhaps the other England defenders who were weary and thinking it was time for the referee's whistle.</p>
<p>Interesting to me: no cards, yellow or red, in the half and although there have been a reasonable number of fouls I haven't seen any really rough play. No one acually did anything worthy of a card.</p>
<p>Remember, although teams scoring first in this tournament are 33W-8T-13L, that Brazil went down early against Turkey and still ended up with the win.</p>
