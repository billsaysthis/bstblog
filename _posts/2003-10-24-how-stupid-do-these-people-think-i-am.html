<p>The text of an email I recieved this morning:</p>
<p>"Dear Citibank Member,</p>
<p>This email was sent by the Citibank server to verify your e-mail address. You must complete this process by clicking on the link below and entering in the small window your Citibank ATM/Debit Card number and PIN that you use on ATM.<br />
<br />This is done for your protection -T- because some of our members no longer have access to their email addresses and we must verify it.</p>
<p>To verify your e-mail address and access your bank account, click on the link below. If nothing happens when you click on the link (or if you use AOL)B, copy and paste the link into the address bar of your web browser.</p>
<p>[some URL I won't include, structured to look like it goes to Citibank's site but actually goes somewhere else entirely]</p>
<p>w---------------------------------------------<br />
<br />           Thank you for using Citibank!<br />
<br />R---------------------------------------------"</p>
<p>Viruses and spam are bad enough but this is simple out and out fraud! Stupid fuckers.</p>
