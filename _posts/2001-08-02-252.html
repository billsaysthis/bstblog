<p><b>Tonight's movie: Croupier</b><br />

<p>The Brits know how to make movies about <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Clockwork+Orange,+A+(1971)" title="A Clockwork Orange">crime</a> and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0117951" title="Trainspotting, which you either love or hate but either way is incredible">addiction</a>. Not surprising that I liked <a href="http://www.croupierthemovie.com/">Croupier</a>, as its directed by Mike Hodges, who also did the original <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0067128" title="The 1971 version with Michael Caine as Carter, not the 2000 version with Stallone">Get Carter</a> (although Hodges did <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093771">hit a rut in the '80s</a>). This one was on Starz! so catch it if you can.</p>
<p>This film is a tense little thriller about a would-be writer who can't break into the paying ranks. Having been raised by a gambler/con man father he knows all about casinos and takes a job in one in London. The <a href="http://www.homunculus.com/profane/reliquary/kingstonalex/images/kingston0065.jpg">gorgeous Alex Kingston</a> (ER's Dr. Elizabeth Corday) plays into his life, although he's living with the quite attractive <a href="http://www.cp16.com/qc4/gina-mckee/gina1.shtml">Gina McKee</a>, which gives us the requisite criminal element, although the film is as much about addiction. Many, many gamblers (such as Mr Tchai, a wealthy Chinese man who plays thousands of punds night after night) but also <a href="http://www2.blockbuster.com/bb/person/details/0,4487,BIO-P+54491,00.html">Clive Owen's</a> Jack Manfred as the title character, who drinks to hallucination and smokes constantly as he finally writes a bestseller based on his life at the casino.</p>
