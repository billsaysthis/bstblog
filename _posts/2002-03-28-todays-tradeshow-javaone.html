<p>A friend was good enough to share his pass to the exhibit floor at the biggest annual Java conference up at Moscone Center and so I drove up for a couple of hours of booth trolling. The most interesting product I saw was M7 Web Foundry from <a href="http://www.m7.com/">M7 Corporation</a>, a Palo Alto startup, that aims to simplify the life of web app (J2EE) developers. The company was founded by some of the top managers and architects from Visual Cafe but unfortunately they aren't doing any hiring now. CNet's Tech News has a <a href="http://news.com.com/2009-1001-868096.html">roundup of show highlights</a> but somehow the articles listed are all about the big companies--Sun, SAP, IBM, Microsoft (who isn't even there, of course)--and nothing about the useful new products from the small companies like M7. Wonder why that is, don't you? &lt;wink&gt;&lt;wink&gt;</p>
<p>I also had the pleasure of running into a few of the old team from iPlanet and Greg Doench from PTR Prentice Hall.</p>
