<p>Continuing the recent theme of what's good for us to eat (good in a healthy, not tasty sense): <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/19/opinion/19POLL.html">When a Crop Becomes King</a>. Another Op-Ed piece from the NY Times, this short essay by Michael Pollan covers why some people might begin to wonder if we've domesticated corn or if corn's domesticated us. We use more of it for more purposes each year and it rewards us by making us and our food animals unhealthy, driving our small to medium size farmers ever closer to bankruptcy, destroying marine systems anywhere connected to the farms, and using up our limited supplies of petroleum ever faster.</p>
