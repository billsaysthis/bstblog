<p>Hello Muddah, hello Faddah, here we are at Camp Grenada:</p>
<p><em>The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals issued an preliminary injunction Monday stopping California's Oct. 7 gubernatorial recall election, in the latest unexpected twist of the unprecedented ballot to decide whether Gov. Gray Davis remains in office. "The secretary of state is enjoined from conducting an election on any issue on October 7, 2003," a three-judge panel ruled Monday. The court stayed its order for seven days to allow the parties to appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.</em></p>
<p>What does it matter know that we know Ah-nuld <a href="http://www.charlotte.com/mld/observer/news/6767869.htm">came to this country illegally</a>? Odd, then, that he would be against laws that benefit illegal aliens. Next, do not forget that Bill Clinton was in state yesterday <a href="http://www.ajc.com/nred/content/news/0903/15clinton.html?urac=n&amp;urvf=10636481270000.7762606567670652">preaching in favor of Davis</a>. I do mean preaching, the event took place at a church in Los Angeles with a gospel choir backing the ex-Prez. Anyway, if the recall is <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,97360,00.html">delayed until March</a> (the next possible date after Oct. 7), it's all over for the Republicans. Which would make me cry but not out of sadness.</p>
