<p>After hearing that Rolling Stones members Keith Richards and Charlie Watts are fans of The Sopranos, Warner Brothers has cast them for acting roles in the mobster drama, reports the Sun. An unnamed source at the show says the legendary guitarist and drummer ''might appear as themselves, but we would like to have them play a pair of old-school British gangsters...We know they love the show just like we love the Stones, so it's really a match made in heaven.''</p>
