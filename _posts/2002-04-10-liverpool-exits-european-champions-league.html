<p>What a bummer! The Reds <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/championsleague/news/2002/0410/20020410lfclead.html">lost 4-2 after Owen misses chances</a> and after keeping things in control until the 68th minute. Even then, with a goal in the 79th minute from Litmanen, the boys were on track to make it through to the semi-finals against Manchester United. But goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek slipped once too often and let Bayern Leverkusen's Ferreira Lucio put one in the net with six minutes left. That made for a 4-3 aggregate score in the Germans' favor. Now Liverpool needs to buckle down, take the maximum points in the remaining Premiership matches, and pray that Arsenal slips to take at least one major Cup home this year.</p>
