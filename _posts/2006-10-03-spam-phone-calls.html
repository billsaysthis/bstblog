<p>Sure, they're telemarketing but I think the spam label is more appropriate since they wanted to help me 'market' this website. As soon as I told the guy it was a personal, non-business website he hung up. Step back to explain: I got a call just now from a man who said he was with  Advertising, who asked if I was saitisfied with being found through the Yahoo! Web Directory.</p>
<p>Posting this as an advance warning to those of you who own their own domain and have supplied accurate phone information in registering it. I wasn't listening closely enough as he started speaking and didn't catch the company name, nor did I think to mention being on the <a href="https://www.donotcall.gov/default.aspx">National Do Not Call Registry</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone will see this and then get called, if so please try and get the company name so we can report these sleazemeisters. Feel free to <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/content/contact.phtml?sub=Do%20Not%20Call%20violation">drop a note to me</a> too, thanks.</p>
