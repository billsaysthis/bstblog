<p>[<span style="font-style:italic;">I can rarely resist adding my 3.14159 bits... even if my own site design lacks any sophistication or </span><a href="http://www.christung.com/2005/03/information-aesthetics-information.htm">aesthetical appeal</a><span style="font-style:italic;"> itself.</span>]</p>
<p>Color and image-wise, <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/">the redesign</a> is definitely nicer, much more sense of space, but the Groups home and My Groups pages don't provide nearly as much information/links as the previous version. This is not so good.</p>
<p>My preference is to see <span style="font-weight:bold;">all</span> of my subscribed groups before any space is used for lower value content such as Editor's Picks, Tips, Create a New Group. More wasted space: the group logos and the separate lines for Organize/View All Groups (the latter links to the <span style="font-weight:bold;">same page</span> as Manage up top after all) and for =owner ...=moderator (both of which could be indicated right next to the name of the groups).</p>
<p>However, I'm also chuffed that after so long with no significant (visible) changes Yahoo! is putting some effort into a good service. Interesting, in a positive way, that <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/2005/03/first_look_at_y.html">several</a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/AWholeLottaNothing?m=425">changes</a> at <a href="http://docs.yahoo.com/info/address/">'hoo!ville</a> are <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/004362.html">happening</a> concurrently.</p>
