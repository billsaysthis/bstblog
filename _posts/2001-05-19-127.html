<p><b>Friday: Slow news day</b><br />

<p>Nothing much to write about today. Went to lunch with <a href="http://home.pacbell.net/bnevins" title="He shoots...he misses">Byron</a> and hung around with some of the <a href="http://www.iplanet.com/products/iplanet_application/home_2_1_1n.html" title="SUCKERS!">gang who still work</a>. Went to the oral surgeon for a consult and will be getting my three wisdom teeth removed early next Thursday. <a href="http://www.santheo.com/restaurant/" title="Blog for The Making of a Restaurant">Surfed</a> the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/links/reading_list.phtml" title="See where I frequent">web</a>. Watching the Avs beat the Blues (at least halfway through the game [Wait--the Blues just scored to close to 3-2]. Yesterday watched the awesome, excellent <a href="http://www.newjerseydevils.com/site.html">New Jersey Devils</a> go up two games to one over the Penguins with a <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/2001/20010517/recap/njdpit.html" title="Brodeur Rules!">3-0 shutout</a>. Reading a cool book and will report in a couple of days when I finish it.</p>
