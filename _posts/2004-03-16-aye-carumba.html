<p>Geffen Records won in court today, or rather they defeated a motion by Axl Rose for a temporary restraining order that would have prevented the label from releasing a Guns N'Roses greatest hits package as scheduled next week. But what really caught my eye was this bit on the long-awaited new GNR release: A "source familiar with the situation said the label has been waiting seven years for Rose to deliver <em>Chinese Democracy</em> and has poured <strong>$13 million</strong> into production of that album after repeated promises that he was about to finish the project." I know studio time and studio musicians are not cheap but day-um, I've never heard of any album costing more than $10M to record!</p>
