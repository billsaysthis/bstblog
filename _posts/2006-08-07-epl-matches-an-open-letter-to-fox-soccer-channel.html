<p>I <a href="http://www.soccertv.com/england.cfm">just read</a> about the deal FSC made <a href="http://www.setanta.com/portal/article/football::england?open&amp;articleid=66adadb97f99928f802571c00060ffd4">with Setanta</a> on EPL broadcasts. I think this is a terrible decision, coming on the heels of fairly good ratings for the World Cup.</p>
<p>I think this is bad not because I might have to spend $150 to see the games but because Setanta has such limited availability in America that I won't be able to subscribe at all! The limited PPV your channel has had in the past was annoying but bearable but this deal will cherry pick even more of the best games.</p>
<p>I suppose fans of Bolton and Middlesboro will be happy since so many more of their matches will feature on FSC but for fans of the big teams--I root for Liverpool--it's simply terrible.</p>
<p>I was thrilled when FSW turned into FSC but now am decidedly unhappy.</p>
<p>I understand that letters like mine are not going to change things any time soon but your executives should understand how badly they messed up this time!I just read about the deal SC made with Setanta on EPL broadcasts. I think this is a terrible decision, coming on the heels of fairly good ratings for the World Cup.</p>
