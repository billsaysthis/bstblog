<p>Normally I would just link this column in <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/linksblog/lbmain.phtml">LinksBlog</a> but Paul Krugman has something to important to miss in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/10/opinion/10FRIE.html">Blunt Question, Blunt Answer</a>. He attends a luncheon with Arab newspaper editors in London and is asked "Are Jews in the media behind the campaign to smear Saudi Arabia and Islam?" Krugman turns the question on his head points out that not only is there no conspiracy but instead the question is asked because the Arabs are deluding themselves. Bravo!</p>
