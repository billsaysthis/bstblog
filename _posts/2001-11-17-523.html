<p><b>Today's movie: The One</b></p>
<p>Considering how <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/2001_05_13_blog_archive.phtml#3648797">anxious</a> I was to see it, I'm as surprised as anyone that it took me two weeks to get to it. But Jet and his buddies at the <a href="http://www.spe.sony.com/movies/theone/" title="Yeah, this is the official website">Multi-Verse Authorities</a> were worth the wait, this flick is far superior to the last <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_11_11_blog_archive.phtml#7049111">two</a> <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_11_11_blog_archive.phtml#7111124">movies</a> I saw. Others (friends, critics) weren't too impressed but I sure was. Li plays the hero and the villain this time out and he really creates two separate, very different characters--this is the first I've ever seen him play a baddie and he's a nasty boy! Writing/producing/directing team James Wong and Glen Morgan found a way to take  cool concept right out of today's physics journals (<a href="http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/213.web.stuff/Jared%20Mixon/page3">the multiverse</a>) and make a tense action movie out of it. Okay, they went a little too far with the central conceit that drives the bad Li but you have to give them a little slack. This is 90 minutes that keeps moving and moving until a titanic confrontation and a conclusion that leaves both Li's happy, sort of.</p>
<p>Wong and Morgan came together as a team writing for the X-Files in its early years, went out on their own with the underrated and sorely missed <a href="http://www.scifi.com/spaceaab/">Space: Above and Beyond</a>, worked again with X-Files creator Chris Carter on the darkly serious TV series <a href="http://www.casfs.org/connote/columns/sftubetalk/6_2/milleniumpreview.html">Millenium</a>, made their feature film debut with last year's <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0195714">Final Destination</a>.</p>
<p>Carla Guigino plays her character in two of the universes, also as different as the two versions of Li, with few pitfalls. Delroy Lindo shows up here with hair! Morgan and Wong bring some of their regulars in here to good effect, especially James Morrison and Tucker Smallwood who played starring roles on Space: A&amp;B.</p>
