<p><b>TV: Weakest Link is too weak to watch</b>
<p>There may have been <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010419/en/television-link_2.html">nothing weak about NBC's "Link'' launch</a>, that is the ratings may have been great, but I watched last night's show and it wore out quickly. This <a href="http://home.nbci.com/LMOID/bb/fd/0,946,-0-5505-headless,00.html?tag=e-nt.pro4.s-2757.e-nt.0">show</a> features a sarcastic, condescending <a href="http://home.nbci.com/LMOID/bb/fd/0,946,-0-5488-headless,00.html" title="what a bitch">host</a> and eight contestants in a mix of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" and "Survivor" to answer several rounds of questions with one contestant being voted off by the others after each round. I think Anne Robinson is going to go insane soon and walk around saying simply "You are the weakest link. Goodbye." to one and all.</p>
<p><i>Update:</i> NBC is planning a special episode, to run against the Survivor II finale, featuring several Survivor I cast members (Richard, Susan, Gervaise, and so on). But, and here's the catch, they <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010419/en/television-weakestlink_2.html">can't use the word Survivor</a> when promoting the episode!</p>
