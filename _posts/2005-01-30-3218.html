<p><a href="http://www.gmailusers.com/">GmailUsers.com</a>, "owned and operated" by Kathie Fry, is another interesting example of a site that could easily deliver a small (but nice for a single person) revenue stream without too much work. Matt Haughey's <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/index.rdf">PVRBlog</a> and <a href="http://80211b.weblogger.com/">Wi-Fi Networking News</a> by <a href="http://blog.glennf.com/">Glenn Fleishman</a> are ones I've known about for a while, though Matt and Glenn (appear to) put in more effort on their sites. And Glenn's might <a href="http://www.glennf.com/vanity/whatido.html">not belong to him personally</a> any more.</p>
