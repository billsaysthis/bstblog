<p>I'm always interested in finding tools that do more, especially when they are essentially free. So after finding out that <a href="http://wbloggar.com">w.bloggar</a> by <a href="http://wbloggar.com/marcelo/blog/" title="His blog is in Portuguese, he's in Brazil">Marcelo L. L. Cabral</a> supported Blogger's title field, I decided to give it a try. This post was made with it. I'd like to find an easier way to edit previously published posts, analagous to the bottom half of the Blogger authoring page, though.</p>
