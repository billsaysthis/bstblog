<p><b>Studying emotional response to the Attack on America</b></p>
<p>The Stanford University School of Medicine Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences Center on Stress and Health is conducting a survey on <a href="http://coping.stanford.edu/">Coping with the Stress of the Terrorist Attacks</a>. The survey took me less than 20 minutes to complete and is easy to complete--other than identifying information, all the answers are checkboxes and radio buttons. I think this research should be supported, scientists rarely have such timely, large scale opportunities to collect data.</p>
