<p><a href="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue358/books2.html" title="SciFi Weekly book review">Pandora's Star</a>: Peter F. Hamilton, who wrote what I consider one of the masterworks of recent science fiction, starts a new series of books. I'm referring to <a href="http://books.fantasticfiction.co.uk/c0/c3358.htm?authorid=3816">The Night's Dawn Trilogy</a>, which sprawled over 3400 pages or so and was actually published in America in six separate volumes. Looks like I missed <a href="http://books.fantasticfiction.co.uk/n9/n47281.htm?authorid=3816">a standalone novel</a> last year but since it's now out in paperback...</p>
