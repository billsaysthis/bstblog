<p>Haven't printed a recipe in awhile, so here's a pretty basic number that goes well with a short pasta like Ziti, rice, or even just some fresh Italian bread (we had it with some Chiabatta bread from the Mountain View Farmer's Market) and a nice salad. Forgive the somewhat pretentious dish name, it was something I just made up having never cooked this before. Nothing too fancy but fresh ingredients make a big difference in taste, serves three-four.</p>
<p><em>Ingredients</em>
<ul>
<li>1 lb. Ground beef<br />
</li>
<li>1 lb. Tree Ear mushrooms, roughly chopped<br />
</li>
<li>1 medium size yellow squash, sliced thin<br />
</li>
<li>2 medium beefsteak or hothouse tomatoes, diced<br />
</li>
<li>2 shallots, diced<br />
</li>
<li>1 cup, fresh cilantro<br />
</li>
<li>5 cloves garlic, smashed and chopped<br />
</li>
<li>2 tbsp. soy sauce<br />
</li>
<li>3 tsp. Hoisin sauce<br />
</li>
<li>Olive oil<br />
</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Preparation</em>
<ul>
<li>About 1-2 hours before cooking, marinate ground beef in soy sauce and 1 tsp. hoisin sauce, with a pinch of salt and a few turns of fresh ground pepper<br />
</li>
<li>Heat olive oil in cast iron pan, then add meat, stirring and chopping to brown meat and separate into tiny bits, then drain oil<br />
</li>
<li>Stir in shallots and garlic, then add two tablespoons of olive oil, simmer for a minute<br />
</li>
<li>Stir in tomatoes and half the cilantro, simmer for a minute<br />
</li>
<li>Stir in squash and 2 tsp. hoisin sauce, add a pinch of salt and a few turns of fresh ground pepper, simmer for 2-3 minutes<br />
</li>
<li>Stir in mushrooms, simmer for 5 minutes<br />
</li>
<li>Turn off heat and fold in remaining cilantro, then serve hot</li>
</ul>
