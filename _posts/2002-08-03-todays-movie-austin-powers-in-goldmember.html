<p>Yeah, baby! I have no clue what the reviewers were going on about when they said <a href="http://www.austinpowers.com/">Austin Powers in Goldmember</a> was a tired and stale retread of the formula. I walked out thinking about AP4 and how the "secret" ending opened up all kinds of interesting possibilities. Okay, I do understand what the reviewers meant about formula: lots of the same bits from the previous film show up again but dammit they did it really well.</p>
<p>Verne Troyer is the big surprise here, even though he never speaks, with some great physical humor. Michael Caine's father is spot on, you see just where Austin got his mojo. The Goldmember character, who hopefully won't be back next time, didn't work quite as well, but was not really important enough to the film to be a problem. Seth Green and his disappearing hair and incipient insanity gave good laughs.</p>
<p>Maybe next time around we'll meet Austin's teenage son?</p>
<p><em>Highly recommended</em></p>
