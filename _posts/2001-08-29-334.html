<p><b>Being a modern woman or a skanky ho?</b></p>
<p>Maureen Dowd wrote an interesting Op-Ed piece for the NY Times called <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/29/opinion/29DOWD.html">The Manolo Moochers</a> all about attitudes towards who pays on a date. Apparently, a lot of women think that men are supposed to pay, but it sure doesn't mean they're going to put out. And men tend to agree:</p>
<p>"It is, as one guy says, 'one of the few remaining ways we can demonstrate our manhood.'"</p>
<p>I know I generally pay but I'm not averse to a woman treating me some of the time when we're in a committed relationship.</p>
