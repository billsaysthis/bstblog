<p>You can probably see the content on this site much better now. For IE or Opera users there should not really be any visible difference. I'm really not too clear on the changes I made in the CSS (a new-fangled presentation markup language for us web geeks) that had this effect though. One really big weirdness was that Navigator on pages other than the homepage was not correctly using the width attribute set on the style used for the left side site navigation menu, even though the same style is used on the homepage and all the others. The difference between the pages is that on the home page there is also a right side set of links in their own DIV (a CSS thing). So I added an invisible DIV on the other pages and now Navigator obeys the width attribute. Yes, you can have INVISIBLE content on web pages. Anyway, this is strange and someone like Eric Meyers could probably explain it, and also point out that the pages on this site do not validate, but as long as it looks good for now at least I am cool.</p>
