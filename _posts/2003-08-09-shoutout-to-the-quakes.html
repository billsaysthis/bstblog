<p>Just want to give some props to the excellent road work last night by the San Jose Earthquakes as <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=95793&amp;cc=5901">they beat</a> the Kansas City Wizards 1-0. The team was lead by Landon Donovan, in his first game back from a month of National Team duty, as he scored the only goal in the 23rd minute off his own rebound (take that, Tony Meola!) and was all over the field in the last half hour after Ramiro Corrales was ejected on a second yellow. The league ought to be reviewing referee Marcel Yonan's work in the game as he was giving out cards like strip club fliers on Eighth Avenue--there's no way Corrales should have gotten that second yellow.</p>
<p>Pat Onstad had another terrific night in goal with his league-leading seventh shutout and Coach Frank Yallop earned his club record 36th win on the night as San Jose pulled six points clear of Kansas City on top of the Western Conference. MLS changed the season organization this year, so I was surprised to see that the team still has a <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/team/results?id=191&amp;cc=5901">dozen games</a> to play but I think I'm going to try and make their next home game, against DC United on the 24th.</p>
