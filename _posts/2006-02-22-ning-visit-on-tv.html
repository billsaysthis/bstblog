<p>Not being one to miss out on an Adam Kalsey visit to the Valley, I went to last week's Ning visit and was surprised to find KRON4's blogger/journalist Brian Shields there with a video camera. He must be good at it because I completely forgot he was there until Adam posted the result of the work in <a href="http://kalsey.com/blog/2006/02/ning_visit_on_tv/index.html">Ning visit on TV</a>. If you watch the clip closely I do appear two or three times but got no lines and once again missed my chance to earn a SAG card. Showing that I am not always the aware and observant geek you see here, I completely didn't realize the tall guy talking with us was none other than Marc "I made the first useful web browser" Andreeson.</p>
