<p>Charles Cooper <a href="http://news.com.com/What%20was%20Sun%20thinking/2010-1071_3-5729856.html?tag=nefd.ac">said pretty much</a> what several people on the Sun Alumni wrote to the mailing list, only better. Love these two quotes:<br />
<blockquote>Sun needs to do something to get Wall Street off its back. The company's stock has been a dog. Shares hit a 52-week low of $3.29 on Aug. 12 and are still stuck below four bucks. If Sun's board of directors wasn't on quaaludes, Scott McNealy would have joined Carly Fiorina on the retired CEO rubber chicken circuit long ago.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later:<br />
<blockquote>Each time McNealy or his No. 2, Jonathan Schwartz, gets through talking, I walk around starry-eyed for an hour thinking, "Gee, that really makes sense. Those guys might really be onto something." Then the aura wears off and I'm back to wondering what I was smoking in the first place.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cooper's been writing for CNet and other techpubs for years. But wow, just wow, what language. Has to be an effect of blogs, no way you'd see that kind of verbiage in such a mainstream outlet five years ago. Really, the board of one of the largest companies in our little burg "on quaaludes!" Excellent.</p>
