<p>I suppose one could put The Smiths in a <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2002/01/17/news/column_wastler/">list of best rock bands</a>. The Beatles would surely be number one almost any criteria. But to leave out Bruce Springsteen, well, these people have to be morons. Springsteen doesn't have a history changing sound, he doesn't raise the roof? What concert have you been at lately? I guess the lesson is not to expect to much from the son of one of America's <a href="http://www.penthouse.com/index.html?skipintro">least creative pornographers</a>.</p>
