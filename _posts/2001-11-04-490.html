<p><b>Rushdie: The politics of terror are religious</b></p>
<p>Salman Rushdie, the outspoken Muslim author, writes in the NY Times that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/02/opinion/02RUSH.html">Yes, This Is About Islam</a>. The "this" referred to, of course, is the current battle between Al Quaeda and it's allies and the rest of the world. Rushdie's honest appraisal follows hard on the heals of related writings by <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_10_28_blog_archive.phtml#6735571">Thomas Friedman</a> and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/FACT/?011022fa_FACT1">Seymour Hersh</a>. The picture of the political Islamists that is emerging is unpleasant, unfriendly, and in need of a massive change if we are to see the end of terror in any reasonable amount of time.</p>
