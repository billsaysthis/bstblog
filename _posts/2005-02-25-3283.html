<p>Excellent OpEd piece in the <em>NY Times</em>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/25/opinion/25milhollin.html?ex=1267074000&amp;en=52a5ff181f9c7622&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">A Shell Game in the Arms Race</a>, that nails our government for doing business with companies that break weapons sanctions. This is not just a Bush/Republican thing, the primary example cited began under Clinton, but IMO the author doesn't go far enough. All these conflicts we see in the news, the fighters on both sides get their weapons from somewhere. Almost always from companies in countries not directly involved. If we want to shut down the Islamic terrorists, the janjaweed militia, the FARC and so forth, why don't we go after the arms suppliers? I cannot believe nearly all the material involved cannot be traced to the originating factories. But that, my friends, would cut into profits!</p>
