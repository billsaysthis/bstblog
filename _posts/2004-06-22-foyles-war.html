<p>Last night I caught an episode of this <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/foyleswar/">charming BBC police procedural</a> from 1994 as shown on PBS' Masterpiece Theater. Missed the first two but there's still one more next week, though this is on KQED's bonus/HD channels not sure if it will be on the regular channel 9; not that <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel9</a>! Michael Kitchen stars as a police inspector for a small village in Southern England in the months before WWII got truly serious.</p>
<p>And what it made me wonder is why does England, mainly BBC from what I can tell, do such good TV so consistently? Less important but also interesting, how come their actors, especially so many of the leads, are older and less physically attractive. Kitchen is not ugly but he had to be in his 50s when this was filmed. I would also point to Ken Stott, star of <em>The Vice</em> currently showing on BBC America's Mystery Monday, is about as attractive as Dennis Franz. And Helen Mirren, from Prime Suspect, not saying she's ugly but she is showing the signs of age.</p>
