<ul>
<li>Amusing visual comparison: old, current, and future versions of the $20 bill <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2003/05/26/arts/26BILLCA01.html">on display</a> at the NY Times.</p>
</li>
<li>Laughably deceitful: AOL <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001046.shtml">wants out</a> of the promise it made (instant messaing interoperability with other IM services) to gain FCC approval for the Time Warner merger. Helps that the current chairman, the laughably useless Michael Powell, was the main dissenter to placing the condition in the first place. Clearly AOL is taking its lead from the Bush Administration's playbook and claiming a full of crap, extremist position is reasonable, moderate, and patriotic.
</li>
<li>Laughably slutty: RomaKimmy, a fellow <a href="http://www.sportsfilter.com">SpoFite</a>, had an extremely honest (and eye-opening, for this male) <a href="http://favolosomondo.port5.com/pMachineFree2.1/comments.php?id=P43_0_1_0">blog post</a> on a recent Friday night bar outing. I always wanted to be a male underwear model when just a tike but never attained the slender, muscular body, large package, or sufficiently vacant stare for the job.
</li>
<li>Laughable (old) interview: Nothing on this afternoon, TS1 and I turn on the tube while munching leftovers for lunch and <a href="http://caroline.warnerbros.com/">The Caroline Rhea Show</a> happens to be on with Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn as the guests. The episode is a repeat from the days when their <a href="http://www.oldschool-themovie.com/">Old School</a> was just released. I had no doubt that Vince and Luke were onstage only because they were required, probably on pain of amputation or similar, and you would agree from their body language, but the interview was beyond hilarious because the men just turned the situation around, constantly interrupting and making Rhea answer or giving nonsense but on target answers. The demographics for the talk show must be barely 17 year old females or women who think like them, which was confirmed by the next guest, a champion baton twirler who gave a lesson as part of her five minutes.
</li>
<li>Laughable sex product concept: Women (and I suppose men) can wear edible panties to excite a partner, but how about something like an edible condom for men to wear? With the appropriate "Does not prevent pregnancy warnings" of course. (note: this was my own laughable idea, hence no linkage, but if you own a company that can produce these, just call and we'll talk royalties or licensing.)
</li>
<li>Not at all laughable, just cool: <a href="http://www.scaled.com/">Scaled Composites</a>, Burt Rutan's company, <a href="http://www.xprize.org/teams/scaled.html">took us</a> one step closer to a real space travel system a week ago.</li>
</ul>
