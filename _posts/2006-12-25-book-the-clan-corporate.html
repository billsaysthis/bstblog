<p>The third book in Charles Stross's entertaining series that meshes science fiction (intra-multiverse travel), fantasy (two of the three Earths featured--so far--are 100 and 500 years behind our's in development) and present-day drug and national security politics, <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/fiction/index.html">The Clan Corporate</a> starts a bit slow but perks up about 30-40 pages in and never lets up.</p>
<p>Still, given its place in the middle of things, the book doesn't really settle any big questions though it does put more plates spinning at the end of sticks. Miriam Beckstein a/k/a Helge voh Thorold d'Hjorth is still in hot water from the events of <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/singlepost.php?id=114391938780908446&amp;titl=Hidden%20Family,%20The&amp;sy=review">The Hidden Family</a>, and we spend much of this episode learning about her clan and its place in the politics of Neijwein.</p>
<p>The defection of Mattias at the end of the second volume has made everyone more than a little paranoid, you see. Plus, the Clan is still interested in bringing the royal family into the worldwalkers' braiding scheme and there are non-Clan political players as well. The results of Mattias' defection on our own American government, personified by DEA agent Mike Fleming, are not, er, unsurprising either; Stross puts the lever squarely in VP Dick Cheney's hands and thereby escalates the scheming.</p>
<p>But Stross really does political well. Further, Miriam's frustration and missteps build throughout and thus she becomes much more human.</p>
