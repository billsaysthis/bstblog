<p>Okay, this sounds really strange, I know, but I'm watching the <a href="http://www.eonline.com/On/Holly/Popup/episode.cheech_chong.html">E! True Hollywood Story episode</a> on the greatest drug comedy duo of all time and one of the first things they bring out is Cheech's dad. Who is a retired Los Angeles policeman. Talk about the minister's daughter! So how did this Chinese guy from Canada and Mexican from East L.A. meet? Cheech was in Canada dodging the Draft (this was the late '60s) and wandered into a strip club run in Vancouver by Chong's family. Not that Chong was some innocent either, he was 30 years old at this point and already had three daughters by three mothers, the most recent mother a 15 year old.</p>
