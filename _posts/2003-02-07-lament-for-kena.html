<p>I concede that you are not a terrorist<br />
<br />That you are a man of passion<br />
<br />Who happens to enjoy the sight of fireballs.</p>
<p>Do not remind me that the sand slipping<br />
<br />Between your fingers is not the same<br />
<br />Substance beating within your heart.</p>
<p>Not that stars shine steadily and only<br />
<br />Appear to blink when filtered by our atmosphere<br />
<br />Filled with protective gasses.</p>
<p>The Sun shines all the time, not only when<br />
<br />Visible to my eyes--Kena is awake in Perth<br />
<br />When I sleep and she sees it bright.</p>
<p>A woman I knew well for a short while,<br />
<br />A vacation years ago to the other side of the world<br />
<br />A memory that burned bright.</p>
<p>I sleep and dream of your fireballs blossoming<br />
<br />With agony and bloody trails facing away<br />
<br />From Kena, whose back is turned forever.</p>
<p>She no longer sees the Sun while I sleep<br />
<br />No longer writes me beautiful letters<br />
<br />Of the feeling of sand slipping through her fingers.</p>
