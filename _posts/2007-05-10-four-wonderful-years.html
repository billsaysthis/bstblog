<p>While I might not have made mention of crossing the 46 line last week, this is a milestone that needs bragging on. <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?pg=gall&amp;gall=wedding">Four years ago tonight</a> Vivian made me happier than I could expect by <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?pg=gall&amp;gall=wedd2">marrying me</a> in front of our family and close friends. Life outside our home has had its ups and down but never intruded into our relationship, only strengthening our bond and commitment.</p>
<p>Thanks Sweetie, and here's to <del>40</del> 400 more years of love!</p>
