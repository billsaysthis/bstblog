<p><b>Cascadia: For real or another web prank?</b></p>
<p>Surfing around this morning, I came to <a href="http://zapatopi.net/cascadia.html">The Republic of Cascadia</a> website. What? You've never heard of this nation? Okay, it isn't recognized by the United Nations just yet and the governments in Washington, D.C., and Ottawa would be quite upset, one thinks. Apparently, some people believe that the <a href="http://www.columbiana.org/cascadia_institute.htm#ConceptofEcoregions">bioregion</a> composed of Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and a small piece of Alaska (not the part with all the oil) ought to be a separate and independent country. On the other hand, the same person who publishes this website also believes that <a href="http://zapatopi.net/blackhelicopters.html">black helicopters</a> are living beings.</p>
