<p><b>Who knew? My username means something interesting</b><br />

<p>blazar is my username on many systems (the standard first initial plus last name) but other than a <a href="http://www.chevrolet.com/blazer/index.htm">misspelling</a>, I never gave it much thought. I never thought to ask <a href="http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgro/egret_blazars.html">What is a blazar?</a> Turns out that a blazar is an astronomical object, a newly uncovered class of active galaxy. Oooh, a whole kind of galaxy named after me!</p>
<p>I found this info after checking out a new clustering engine named <a href="http://www.vivisimo.com">Vivisimo</a>, which does not search/crawl the web itself but organizes the outputs of other search engines. The marketing dweebs at Vivismo use the term clustering engine instead of metasearch engine because its <a href="http://vivisimo.com/html/FAQ.html#Whatdocclus">core technology</a> is the automatic organization of documents into meaningful groups. The company is a spinout from the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/">Computer Science labs</a> of <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I spent my somewhat happy freshman year of college.</p>
