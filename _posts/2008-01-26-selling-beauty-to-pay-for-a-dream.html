<p>My friend Pam has opened a new blog, <a href="http://pamslifeonsale.blogspot.com/">Goal: Australia 08</a>, listing some art pieces she's collected over the years that are now for sale to help pay for her trip later this year to Australia.  As she writes in the sidebar, "make me an offer so that I may truly realize this seemingly impossible  dream."</p>
<p>My favorite of the pieces listed so far is this Balinese Topeng:</p>
