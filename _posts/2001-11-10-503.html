<p><b>Cool TV: 24</b></p>
<p>A TV series that takes a whole season of 24 episodes to show 24 hours, a single day, in the presidential campaign of Sen. David Palmer. I just watched the first hour of <a href="http://www.fox.com/24/home.html">24</a> and it looks good, real good. My biggest question was what happens if someone misses one episode, will they lose the entire thread, but Fox is going to debut episodes Tuesdays at 9:00, then repeat them on FX Mondays at 10:00. This week, they also showed the episode tonight at 9:00 and will show it on FX on Sunday night as well. The website looks interesting too and it includes a minute by minute breakdown of each episode (as the episode airs).</p>
