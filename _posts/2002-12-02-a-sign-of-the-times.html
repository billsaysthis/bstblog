<p>Very unfortunate indeed. The following two sentences were the entirety of the text, other than navigation, posted on the Careers page of a company which I'd like, one day, to employ me. So I won't be naming any names.</p>
<p>"If you are looking for an opportunity to work on the technology of tomorrow, then join us.</p>
<p>[Company Name] currently has no positions available."</p>
<p>Kind of a sentence-length oxymoron, isn't it. The side effect of a page template and lack of attention to detail: who ever thought a company with millions of dollars in sales per quarter.</p>
