<p><strong>Last night's restaurant: House of Prime Rib</strong></p>
<p>Are you in the SF area and in the mood for the best prime rib you'll ever eat? Fortunately for me, my buddy persisted and after a couple of years finally got me to eat at the classic <a href="http://www.zagat.com/Search/Details.asp?VID=1&amp;PID=1&amp;LID=30&amp;LSID=71&amp;BRW=22&amp;NDPH=Steakhouses&amp;RID=16418">House of Prime Rib</a>. The place has been on Van Ness for 50 years now and the food is still tops. As long as you want prime rib since that's the only thing on the menu. I asked the waiter and he said they cooked 720 portions for the night (they had reservations for 560!). The meat just melts in your mouth. Vegetarians stay home but anyone else can enjoy this.</p>
