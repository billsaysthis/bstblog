<p>That was the last time the 49ers were shut out in a regular season NFL game before today's 34-0 loss to the Seahawks. Probably the last time the team had such a pitiful effort too. Seemed fairly comparable to last night's Earthquakes match except the Niners' opponents came to play. Bonjour tristess, indeed.<br /></p>
