<p>One of my good friends, a very sweet woman named Betsy, got married this weekend to Steve Robinson, hence her new name and the cliched post title. I really wish we could have been there to help celebrate but the affair took place on the eastern coast of Florida. I have been assured by the bride that the entire day was amazing, truly memorable and the whole thing went by in a flash, and I can relate to that--I hardly believe more than a year has passed since my own wedding. She's sending some photos soon but I know that Betsy was a most beautiful bride and I wish them all the love, health and happiness in the world.</p>
