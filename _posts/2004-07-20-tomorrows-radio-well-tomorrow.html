<p>Showing the&nbsp;ease with which good ideas can proliferate on the web, John Robb is launching <a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/conversations/">Intelligent Defense</a> tomorrow. <em>ID</em> is intended as "a series of conversations dedicated to a deeper understanding of next generation terrorism and what we can do to defend ourselves against it." The series is a companion to Robb's <a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/">Global Guerillas blog</a>, which itself is a research portal for books and other ventures he has in mind, and takes&nbsp;Doug Kaye's increasingly popular&nbsp;<a href="http://www.itconversations.com/">IT Conversations</a> model into a new topic space.</p>
