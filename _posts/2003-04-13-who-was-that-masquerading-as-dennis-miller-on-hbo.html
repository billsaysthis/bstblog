<p>When did Dennis Miller turn into a fullblown Rush and Cheney lover and official stand up comedian of the Republican party? I kept watching <a href="http://www.hbo.com/dennismillerrawfeed/?ntrack_para1=feat_main_title">his new special</a> tonight, waiting for him to crack up with laughter and explain that his jokes were just, well, a put on and that he'd get on to the real stuff. But. But he never did! I realize the last couple of years have affected some people more than others but this was over the edge. And just not funny.</p>
