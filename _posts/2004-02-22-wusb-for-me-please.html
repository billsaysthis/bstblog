<p>Wireless USB <a href="http://deviceforge.com/articles/AT9015145687.html">seems very cool</a> and I hope it will show up in products very soon. Based on ultra-wideband radio, the first version will run at 480 MB/second at distances up to 10 meters. So not a one:one replacement for 802.11 but easily able to support home networks that span TVs and stereos in addition to PCs and printers. Yowsa!</p>
