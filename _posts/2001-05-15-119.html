<p><b>New Patents: Internet Alarm Clock, Cooking pasta without water</b><br />

<p>Is necessity the mother of invention, as the cliche goes? <a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/bios/diamond.html">Jared Diamond</a>, in his huge bestseller <a href="http://www.uclanews.ucla.edu/lectures/Diamond/" title="an online abridged version">Guns, Germs, and Steel</a> argues that this assertion is quite false. Still, people keep cooking up <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/14/technology/14PATE.html">new and sometimes useful ideas</a>. Primo Bugane of Alpignano, Italy, has a devised a special pot (for which he received a patent) that cooks pasta al dente in the sauce (or the gravy, as <a href="http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/insidersguide/cast/" title="Sopranos wiseguy">Silvio Dante</a> would call it). Mary Smith Dewey of Dallas patented a system (an internet appliance) that downloads real-time information about weather and traffic to help people get to work or appointments on time by adjusting the time an alarm clock rings.</p>
