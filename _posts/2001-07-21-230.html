<p><b>Today's movie: Requiem for a Dream</b><br />

<p>Director Darren Aronofsky knows weird. I mean <a href="http://www.pithemovie.com/pithemovie.html">strange</a>. Plus, he knows Brooklyn or he found someone who told him the way to <a href="http://www.coneyisland.com/">Coney Island</a> and back. So, if you want to see a really cool film that is only superficially about the <a href="http://www.theantidrug.com/">evils of drugs</a> but is really about the <a href="http://whitehouse.gov/president/">evils of addictions</a> of all types, check out <a href="http://www.requiemforadream.com/">this film</a>. Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans (yes, the same guy who made you puke in <a href="http://video.go.com/scarymovie/html/index.html">Scary Movie</a>) give great performance--only Connelly <a href="http://www.pleasure.co.nz/sex/oralsex2.html" title="Sample quote: The girl who gives good head will be most appreciated.">gives head</a> (although you don't actually see this onscreen)--and Aronofsky and editor Jay Rabinowitz take their performances to an entirely <a href="http://willow-web.net/drugfacts/LSD/lsdrisks.html">different plane</a> with shot selection, pacing, and sound effects. Definitely cool but you need to have an open mind to enjoy.</p>
