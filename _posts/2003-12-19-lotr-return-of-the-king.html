<p>Had an amazing time last night with LordB and LadyA plus TS1, featuring my brisket and LadyA's low carb cheesecake. Then we were off to see the Wizard (Gandalf, of course) and 220 minutes of terrific film. However, I'm planning on a second viewing next week and will hold off any real write up until after that. Word of warning: Watch what you drink before and during the movie, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/12/19/DDG353NNMT32.DTL">or else</a>. Still, run, don't walk, to see this film!</p>
