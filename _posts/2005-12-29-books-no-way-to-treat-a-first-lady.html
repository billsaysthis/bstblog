<p>Christopher Buckley writes intelligent, funny books and <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780375758751">No Way to Treat a First Lady</a> is no exception. Imagine if Bill Clinton had died one night in the White House under mysterious circumstances, after an intimate conference with the lovely wife of a major contributor in the Lincoln Bedroom and returning to sleep next to Hillary. Plenty oof complications and the mock-Ms. Clinton engages the nation's leading, sleaziest criminal defense attorney who just happens to be the man she dumped to marry the future President. One pleasure in reading this is that the more aware you are of American politics the more you get out of this.</p>
