<p>Spent a bunch of time last night and today writing a new function in <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> for this site and you can see the result over on the right side where a link says "bst Year Ago". That phrase sounds awkward and might get changed but the functionality will stay the same, which is to provide a hyperlink to the weblog from one year in the past of the day someone views the page. For now I think this is only useful on the main page so that's the only place it appears. This is a standard feature in some other weblogging systems (Radio, MovableType) but I have not seen it before for Blogger, especially not a version written in PHP. Then again I haven't looked that hard either.</p>
<p>I need a refinement in the Blogger template to finish/polish this feature, to set an anchor link in the weblogs on a per day basis in addition to the current per entry basis, but I'm not sure that's possible at this moment given the Blogger functionality. So for now clicking the link takes you to the top of the appropriate blog archive file. Once I have a year's worth of <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/linksblog/lbmain.phtml">LinksBlog!</a> I will add it in there as well.</p>
<p>Code is fairly nicely set up to allow others to use this, I think, and even has a few comments to explain what's going on. Source is available <a href="mailto:blogarchivescode@billsaysthis.com">on request</a>.</p>
