<p>I came to an important realization yesterday, after reading of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/01/politics/01dobson.html?incamp=article_popular_2">the latest pronouncements</a> from right wing intellectual leader James Dobson, though it may have been obvious already to others. Dobson and others in his circle don't care one whit about whether their tactics and speeches are fair, truthful or <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/?p=5544">consistent with past positions</a> on the same issues. Redefining the meaning of politically-loaded terms or <a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript351_full.html">shaving the context</a> from what opponents say is absolutely acceptable. The only concern is advancing their agenda because they <span style="font-style:italic;">know</span> in their hearts of their righteousness; the rest of us had better accept this devious strategy and account for it in our own efforts if we really want to return them to the political fringe where they belong.<br /></p>
