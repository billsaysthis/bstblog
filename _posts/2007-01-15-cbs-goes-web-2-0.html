<p>To promote top-rated <span style="font-style:italic;">CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</span> for the month that Gil Grissom (William Peterson) is off doing a play in Chicago, the show is bringing in a mysterious cop character and to go along with the storyline CBS has put together a nice website called <a href="http://keppler.cbs.com/">Who is Keppler?</a> The site has user-contributed video mashups, tagging, rating, friend lists, Google Map of registered user locations and mobile content and is built with Palo Alto-based <a href="http://ning.com/">Ning</a>.</p>
