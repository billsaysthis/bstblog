<p>Could John Malone be thinking of <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000081&amp;sid=a3MR91rhpm5s&amp;refer=australia">bidding for News Corp.</a>? Malone is a pretty cagey veteran of the cable TV industry and has more experience building, buying and selling both cable systems and networks and playing the Wall Street game than anyone else. One wonders how he might change the level of political bias at Murdoch's empire if this comes to pass--I have to admit to being uninformed on Malone's political leanings.</p>
