<p>Okay, Kevin Garnett is a good basketball player, a very good one. And he has led the Minnesota Timberwolves to better results each of the past few years. So his current contract, signed four years ago and paying an average of $21 million a year (with two years left), is not necessarily out of line given that he was the only All-Star on the team when negotiated.</p>
<p>Now the two sides are talking extension, hoping to get a deal done before the NBA season starts in a week, and this is where I just lose it, and the whole deal loses touch with reality. Garnett is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/sports/AP-BKN-Timberwolves-Garnett.html">eligible for an extension worth $139 million</a> for four years; given basketball norms, the whole deal is probably guaranteed, bad performance, injury, whatever. That's $32.25 million per year, friends, and more than Kobe or Shaq ($19,2M/year, going up to $22M in an extension that kicks in next year) or Iverson makes. By a lot.</p>
<p>Of course, being eligible for that amount and getting it are two different things; The Minneapolis Star Tribune reports the T-Wolves' initially offered a four-year extension worth "only" around $75 million. Also factoring in are the need to resign fellow All Star Wally Szczerbiak and point guard Terrell Brandon's big money deal. Since the team and Garnett's agent are still negoatiating, one has to believe the final number will come in well over $75M.</p>
