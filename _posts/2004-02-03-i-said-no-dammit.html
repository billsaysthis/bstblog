<p>Michael Watkins wrote a detailed essay on the recent event of his not being granted tenure at Harvard Business School, <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/MichaelWatkins/2004/01/26#a75">On Not Getting Tenure/Academic Parasitism at HBS</a>, which went into far more detail and discussion of what he sees as negative developments at the venerable institution than you'd expect. But I think this is an example of how blogging is changing, for some people, just what is acceptable to say in public versus the kind of discretion most of us expected 10 or 20 years ago. Then Watkins probably would have had a few beers with pals and vented for an evening; now he's published something that, due to various linkage, will probably be read by several or many thousands.</p>
