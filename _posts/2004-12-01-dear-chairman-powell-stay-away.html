<p>[In response to a request from the creative staff of <a href="http://www.fox.com/familyguy/">Family Guy</a>, via <a href="http://www.planet-familyguy.com/main.php">Planet Family Guy</a>, I sent the following message to FCC Chairman Michael Powell and the other commissioners. Feel free to do the same to help them see we don't need their fingers covering our eyes when the TV's on.]</p>
<p>I am writing to give you my perspective on the recent round of high profile events regarding appropriate material in broadcasting. First, the criticism of the Desperate Housewives promo broadcast on Monday Night Football is ridiculous when during the same and similar broadcasts we see advertising that directly (Cialis, Levitra, Viagra) and indirectly (beer, cars and more) use the same techniques of scantily clad women to sell their products.</p>
<p>Second, I'm truly upset that about a third of ABC's affiliates chose not to broadcast a great and important film, Saving Private Ryan, even though they did the previous two years due to fear of punitive action from your agency. This film is an important one because it is one of the most realistic popular depictions of war, and one of the few ways our society has to bring that understanding to members who've never been close to it. Such understanding is crucial in helping them make decisions while voting and otherwise participating in our democracy.</p>
<p>Finally, I feel very strongly that any attempt by the FCC (as reported in the popular media) to impose its content-based regulations on cable TV networks and satellite radio would be a mistake. Despite some limited use of public airwaves, these communication channels provide for a much wider range of entertainment and information than over the air TV and radio broadcasters and as such should have the freedom to explore what best serves their audiences. Frankly, this is exactly where the phrase "If you don't like it, don't turn it on" is most appropriate especially because such services are available only to paying customers.</p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration.<br /></p>
