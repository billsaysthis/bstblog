<p>Peter Yared, a former co-worker at NetDynamics and Sun, posted <a href="http://home.pacbell.net/pyared/musings/index.html">a few interesting essays</a> on corporate computing centered around web services. When I mentioned agreeing with him, since he's laid out a fairly commonsense approach, he said "Well it all seems pretty simply and obvious to some, but you would be surprised by how the vast majority of folks in the industry violently disagree with these articles!!!" Then again, Peter, not all of us were smart enough to turn our Sun stock into a nice black Ferrari like you did.</p>
