<p>No, I'm not intentionally referring to Richard Adams' classic novel. Miami Steve, my less than three month old MacBook, which was doing so well, pretty much, shut down last night. None of the diagnostics helped and reinstalling the system software wasn't an option since the hard drive isn't visible to the Installer DVD.</p>
<p>In fact I had to bring it to the Apple Store this morning where it will--at the least--get a new hard drive and internal top case. Miami Steve suffers from the discoloration malady, might as well remedy it as well while the repairmen have it. Given my multiple deaths experience with Little Steven, the Toshiba laptop I previously used (and am temporarily booting now as well), I sure hope the tech does deep diagnostics to determine what caused the failure.</p>
<p>While the computer failing so soon after purchase is disappointing enough, I'm also seriously unhappy that, considering I paid for the extended warranty, for the 7-10 day quoted repair period Apple does not supply a loaner. I've been using iBackup and so hopefully the restore won't be too painful.</p>
<p>The significantly less expensive Toshiba/Fry's extended warranty provided for one any time the box was in their hands more than 24 hours. With the two day Thanksgiving holiday coming up in seven days, the odds that Miami Steve will be home to celebrate with us seem sadly small.</p>
