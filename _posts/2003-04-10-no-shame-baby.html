<p>[I wrote these lyrics on Valentines Day as a present for The Sweet One]</p>
<p>We met so long ago, seems like yesterday<br />
<br />A little walk in the rain, sunshine everyday<br />
<br />I don't know what came before you<br />
<br />I'm just glad you're here to stay!</p>
<p>No shame, baby, in sayin' I love you,<br />
<br />For all time, cause you're mine<br />
<br />No shame at all, no no no<br />
<br />Cause you treat me baby oh so fine, yeah</p>
<p>A little confusion in our path, nothin' enough to dissuade us<br />
<br />Time enough to bring our hearts together<br />
<br />Running hands through each other's hair<br />
<br />Kissing shamelessly because we care!</p>
<p>No shame, baby, in sayin' I love you,<br />
<br />For all time, cause you're mine<br />
<br />No shame at all, no no no<br />
<br />Cause you treat me baby oh so fine, yeah</p>
<p>[bridge]<br />
<br />No doubt that you've taken my heart<br />
<br />No doubt that I'll love you forever<br />
<br />No doubt that we are meant for each other<br />
<br />No doubt that we'll be together.</p>
<p>No shame, baby, in sayin' I love you,<br />
<br />For all time, cause you're mine<br />
<br />No shame at all, no no no<br />
<br />Cause you treat me baby oh so fine, yeah</p>
<p>I love everything about you girl<br />
<br />The way you touch me, the wave in your hair<br />
<br />We can live as one for all time I know<br />
<br />All I need is the way you care</p>
<p>No shame, baby, in sayin' I love you,<br />
<br />For all time, cause you're mine<br />
<br />No shame at all, no no no<br />
<br />Cause you treat me baby oh so fine, yeah</p>
