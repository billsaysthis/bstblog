<p>In <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/7219708.stm">an analysis</a> that should startle no informed person, the Human Rights Watch World Report 2008 says that the US, EU and other democracies are accepting flawed and unfair elections out of political expediency.</p>
<p>Allowing autocrats to pose as democrats without demanding they uphold civil and political rights risked undermining human rights worldwide, it warned. For example, HRW said that Pakistan, Thailand, Bahrain, Jordan, Nigeria, Kenya and Russia had been falsely claiming to be democratic.</p>
<p>Personally I was shocked, completely shocked, to read that <del>Bush apologist</del> US state department spokesman Sean McCormack said, without reading the report, that out country did not promote false democracy nor condone human rights abuses. "In terms of the United States and this administration speaking up in defence of, and advocating for, and putting its effort behind its rhetoric, I don't think there's any question about where we stand in terms of promotion of democracy," McCormack said.</p>
