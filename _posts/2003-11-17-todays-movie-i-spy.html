<p>In the '60s, <a href="http://epguides.com/ISpy/">I Spy</a> was a fun TV show but like far too many films based on similar inspiration, <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/ispy/index.html">I Spy</a> the movie should never have been made. Eddie Murphy can usually be counted on for a laughs and he does deliver here and Owen Wilson is okay, but director Betty Thomas (yes, the former <em>Hill Street Blues</em> cop) makes everything easy and obvious. She has a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0858525/#director">track record</a> of doing the same, so no big surprise.</p>
<p><em>Not recommended</em></p>
