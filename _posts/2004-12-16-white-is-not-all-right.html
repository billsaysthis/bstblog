<p>The SciFi Channel earlier this week debuted a four hour movie called <a href="http://earthsea.scifi.com/">Legend of Earthsea</a> and, despite generally miserable reviews, got "<a href="http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2004-12/16/12.00.sfc">big ratings</a>." The telefilm was derived from two classic novels by <a href="http://www.ursulakleguin.com/">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Wizard of Earthsea</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tombs of Atuan</span>, and the author herself was upset enough to post a disparaging essay titled <a href="http://trashotron.com/agony/columns/2004/12-15-04.htm">Earthsea in Clorox</a>. Novelists winding up furious at how Hollywood treats their work is nothing new--some authors have refused the dangled gelt while others have only accepted when a studio was willing to give them meaningful involvement in the production--but Le Guin's essay is particularly interesting because of her focus not on how her storyline was changed but because the main characters' skin colors were.
