<p>I'm still watching as much of the World Cup as possible, of course, and been fortunate to avoid learning the score of lunchtime games all week so I could enjoy them after work. I really do appreciate that ABC has spent the money and resources to bring every single game to me live.</p>
<p>Really though, do the announcers have to mention the US team within every five minute block? If I hear one more time that USA need to beat Ghana to move on--which happened while typing the first part of this sentence--I might have hit the mute button.</p>
<p>That has to be my number one complaint, more generally that the announcers and color men are incredibly repetitive. Even the many people unfamiliar with the sport watching these American broadcasts cannot possibly enjoy being told the same facts over and over through every single game.</p>
<p>Guys, football is a game of finesse and power but your announcing style is all power. Feel free to leave some sonic spaces now and then.</p>
