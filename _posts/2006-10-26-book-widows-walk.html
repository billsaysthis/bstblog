<p>Spenser is the ultimate in modern hard-boiled PIs. A former cop who works for anyone that needs an answer, he knows Massachusetts and fine cooking as well as he does the Boston underworld. He loves Susan Silverman above all, though the truth seems to run a close second.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.robertbparker.net/bookpage.asp?ISBN=5559608734">Widow's Walk</a> is  a story that tests his allegiance to both. Right at the start he's hired by Rita Fiore, the beautiful lawyer who won't give up on wooing him away from Susan, to help her defend Mary Smith against the charge that Mary murdered her older, very wealthy husband. Will Spenser do what his client needs or confirm what his old pals on the Homicide squad, Quirk and Nelson, believe?</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Spenser</span> novels are not intended to challenge the reader unless one insists on trying to guess the twists that Robert Parker always includes, which I've never felt was a good way to enjoy a book. They are savory confections whose pleasures come from witty, and sometimes poignant, dialog, intense local coloring and a heaping serving of comeuppance from characters who may not be guilty of the crime in question but are definitely arrogant enough that Spenser or Hawk need only apply a bit of pressure to take a fall.</p>
