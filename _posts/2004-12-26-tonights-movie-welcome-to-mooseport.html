<p>A bit of quality in a small major studio film, Gene Hackman, a year after leaving office as the most popular president in US history, and Ray Romano, owner of a local hardware store, define the word contrast as they contest for the mayoralty of a small town and the hand of a pretty veterinarian (Maura Tierney) in <a href="http://www.welcometomooseport.com/">Welcome To Mooseport</a>.</p>
<p>Something you don't see a lot of, scriptwriter Tom Schulman gives both of the men character growth and personal insight and director Donald Petrie, often a <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_04_25_blog_archive.phtml#108293871595058119">hit</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120764/">mis</a>s proposition, creates an authentic modern small town environment. Everybody knows each other and says good morning but they also play golf; one bit missing, now that I think about it, is an almost complete lack of home PCs or internet use. I suppose movie makers in general are still figuring out how to integrate something that doesn't lend itself well to the visual demands of film.</p>
<p>A little nit: While they chose a great, completely suitable song to run over the end credits, <a href="http://www.xtcidearecords.co.uk/lyrics/lyrics_1.htm">Mayor of Simpleton</a>, why did they use some unknown band called The Engine Room which I can't even find in <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/">AllMusic</a> instead of the classic powerpop original by <a href="http://www.xtcidearecords.co.uk/">XTC</a>?</p>
<p><em>moderately recommended</em></p>
