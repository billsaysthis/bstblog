<p><b>Definite weirdness</b><br />

<p>In an article about <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010820/en/people-sinatra_2.html">Sinatra's Beverly Hills house being up for sale</a>, I saw the following and had a mindquake:</p>
<p>"At a party celebrating Sinatra's 80th birthday, 'he had Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen there, and the three of them were around the piano playing and singing,'' he said. 'And Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme were there.'''</p>
