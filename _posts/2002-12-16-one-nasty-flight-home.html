<p>Flying home yesterday was one of those flights you really just don't want to be on. Full plane--why did United use a B757 on such a popular cross-country flight instead of, say, a 767? Of course 30 minutes was not enough time to board and seat every passenger, meaning we were late pulling away from the gate, missed our takeoff slot and therefore had to sit and wait 20 minutes for an opening. Get up in the air and less than an hour later the plane runs into some turbulence and the seatbelt signs go on. Just for a few minutes, no big deal.</p>
<p>A little while later, more turbulence, seatbelts on again, also for not too long. The oh so tasty meal is served and cleared. What next? More turbulence, of course! This time we're locked into our seats for nearly two hours as the pilot moves up and down searching in vain for some smooth air. Amazingly, the Sweet One is able to nap through a long stretch of this. My stomach is not at all happy and my choice to take two Xanax before the flight turned out to be very wise. Finally the pilot is able to turn off the signs and half the plane runs for the toilets; fortunately I get to them before most of the others but TSO is not so lucky and has to stand in line for twenty minutes. Not finished with us yet, the seatbelt signs go on yet again and we are locked in for the last hour plus before touchdown, as well as 15 minutes more on the plane for an extra-long taxi to the terminal.</p>
<p>Still, we finally get to our car, have an uneventful ride home and sleep in our own beds!</p>
