<p>Well sort of, it's still a bit stiff and painful. But better than last week. Aren't you glad? If not, read on.</p>
<p>One more thing to make you feel good this morning: <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,62052,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_2">U.S. Uranium Stock in Peril</a>. Or is this just part of the studio hype for <a href="http://www.perfectscoremovie.com/indexflash.html">The Perfect Score</a>?</p>
<p>Dan Gillmor reports that a <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001712.shtml">Mobile Phone Uber-Directory in the Works</a> which is a good thing (right?) because the fact that no one can now look up your cell number is such a terrible obstacle for all those well-meaning people who need to call and tell us about their great thing. Whatever that thing might be. You say the FTC's Do Not Call system will protect us; I reply that politicians and charities, not to mention corporations that have a <em>relationship</em> with us, are exempt from that otherwise fine idea.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/sports/baseball/mlb/dodgers/la-sp-plaschke25jan25,1,110695.column?coll=la-headlines-sports-mlb-dodger">sad ending</a> to Leon Wagner's life is one of those stories which says to me, man, we suck at taking care of each other. Though there is little overt connection to Wagner's tale, thinking about it makes me want to call up Dick Cheney and ask him if he can look his daughter in the eye and say "I support the constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage."</p>
<p>This is funny, for contrast: Rory's <a href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/2692.aspx">Career Pinata</a> explains a lot about the last few years for me. [<em>via the non-homophobic <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2004/01/27.html">Joel</a>]</em></p>
