<p>Karl Martino, proprieter of <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/">paradox1x</a>, a fellow native New Jerseyan, <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/archives/00000372.shtml">guitarist</a>, web geek, and <a href="http://www.empirenet.com/~dljones/dt.html">Hitchhiker</a> fan, has unveiled the Tri-State Syndicate. I have no idea what he means by this, other than weblogs by people who were born or live in the states of New York, New Jersey, or Pennsylvania, but hey a link is as good as a nod, or so Rod Stewart mean to say 30 odd years ago. And haven't they been odd years? I would say definitely. Conversely Karl has laid out some good, and not odd, <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/archives/00000062.shtml">Principals From Programming</a> too.</p>
