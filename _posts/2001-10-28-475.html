<p><b>Talking Moose: Useless guide to Porn on the Internet</b></p>
<p>The Moose has been spot on so often that you want to read any new essays and get that good hit again and again. With <a href="http://talkingmoose.manilasites.com/">The Talking Moose's Guide to Pornography on the Internet</a>, rates about a 3.5 on a scale of 10 and makes me wonder why he even bothered. He starts with a big warning of what's coming, security and cleanup tips, and then the meat. Only there is no meat. The Moose mentions <a href="http://www.easypic.com/">one site</a> as the "best" porn portal he's found. Warns that--big surprise--pics are free but video requires a credit card and the free material is mixed with advertising. He gives us a pointer to a site that hosts <a href="http://www.sexblogs.com/">sex weblogs</a>. I expected better from someone who spends his days naked in a mud bog; doesn't a guide usually have more than two items listed and saying "Anyway, that'll get you started on the porn road" doesn't get TM off the hook.</p>
