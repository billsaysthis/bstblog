<p><strong>The Watchers get on the case</strong></p>
<p>Well I'm glad to see the Zaphods finally got off their duffs and <a href="http://winerlog.editthispage.com/2001/12/18">responded to Dave's awards</a>--can we call them the Fruities? Winerlog calls them "Dave's Big Ego Awards," "Dave's 'I have a Big Dick Awards'," and "narcissim awards." Their weblog entry also points out the incredibly obvious fact that "Dave just wants love and attention." Don't we all, guys?</p>
<p>Cam Barret, who writes the swell CamWorld, <a href="http://www.camworld.com/journal/rants/2001/12/17.html">rants</a> in response to his Blogger of the Year nomination. He wants nothing to do with the awards which "are nothing but a disgusting display of self-importance from the man himself. They are also a thinly-veiled effort to show off the somewhat useful, but hardly robust, content management features of Dave's Manila software, which runs many of the sites nominated." And of course the MetaFilter gang <a href="http://metatalk.metafilter.com/mefi/1526#19709">jumped in with gusto</a>; got to give Winer credit, he did respond on that thread. Some of the folks there, though, are unfortunately just way stuck in the <a href="http://denbeste.nu/entries/00001388.shtml">multi-culturalism virus</a> that says everyone is equally good at every possible activity.</p>
<p>Don't they all realize that BillSaysThis is the greatest weblog, no, heck, the greatest single piece of writing ever made by the hand of Man?</p>
