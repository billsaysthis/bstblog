<p><b>The Giggle Protocol</b><br />

<p>The <a href="http://www.opengiggle.org/">giggle protocol</a> has been developed after literally man-minutes of discussion and coding. An extension of current, yet limited internet standards we felt it necessary to create a new one, for the purposes of distributed giggling. Naturally, much like the act of a giggle itself all details and code for the giggle protocol are completely opensourced, and available from this webpage, free for all to download.</p>
<p>So say the developers. I have no clue what this does but it just sounds funny.</p>
