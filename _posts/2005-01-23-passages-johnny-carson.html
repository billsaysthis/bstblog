<p>Only days after news came out that he was keeping his hand in by sending the occasional joke to David Letterman, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4200385.stm">Johnny Carson has died</a> from emphysema at 79. I was never too big a fan of <em>The Tonight Show</em> because of the timeslot and inconsistency of the material but when he was on, in the monologue or with a guest, he could be as funny as anyone within the constraints of the form. I also admired the way he lived his life after retiring--he actually retired and didn't wage a campaign to keep his ego inflated. As Karnac might say, "A model of class, humor and simplicity with a side serving of whacky."</p>
