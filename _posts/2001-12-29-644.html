<p><strong>Proof we're getting older: Radio</strong></p>
<p>I mainly listen to three stations, all of which play a variety of album-oriented classic rock. The station out of these three which probably skews to the oldest demographic is <a href="http://www.kfox.com/main.html">KFOX - The Classic Rock Experience!</a>, which plays a moderately softer version of '70s classic rock. When I was listening just now in the car they played an ad for a digestive system aid product generally only useful to people well over 40!!!</p>
<p>The other two stations are <a href="http://www.kfog.com">KFOG</a> and <a href="http://www.1077thebone.com/home.html">101.7 The Bone</a> (KSAN). All three stations will play Led Zeppelin, the Beatles, and U2. KFOG appeals to the youngest audience of the three, you're going to hear Dave Mathews Band and REM, and some bands that made their first record after 1990. The Bone rocks the hardest, with lots of AC/DC and Black Sabbath. KFOX is the only one that will play the Eagles, Elton John and Billy Joel and breaks away from the music to broadcast Sharks home games.</p>
<p>None of the three play anywhere near enough Springsteen!</p>
<p>p.s. While we're on the topic of rock and roll, Neil Young has finally made his new song Let's Roll <a href="http://www.repriserec.com/neilyoung/neil.html">available online</a>. Talk about getting old but Neil made his first record 35 years ago!</p>
