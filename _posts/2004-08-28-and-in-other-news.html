<p>Kudos to <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scoble</a> and the rest of the team for <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9</a>, especially <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=14">the videos</a>. I realize I'm a little late to the game here but MSFT is really making an interesting attempt to break the fourth wall between this, the staff blogs and generally making more information available sooner. Sure, to some degree they're reacting to open source and other challenges and they've rarely (if ever) been first with any of these tools, but I see them pretty far ahead of the competition at this point.<br /></p>
