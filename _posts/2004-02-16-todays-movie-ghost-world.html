<p>Some films are moving and involving, drawing you into their own small world and Terry Zwigoff's <a href="http://www.mgm.com/ghostworld/">Ghost World</a> is one of those. Thora Birch and Scarlett Johannson are lifelong girlfriends who graduate from an LA high school as the story begins. Birch is completely lost in the world, adrift from even her one good friend, her single parent father and eventually even from the complete dork (an excellent Steve Buscemi) she meets and befriends him after playing for a fool. A single summer's slice of life wherein a young woman must awaken from the slumber of school yet filled with some complex emotional interactions and vivid visual imagery.</p>
