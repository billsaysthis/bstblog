<p>Unbelievable, just <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9063708/">totally sad</a>. The flooding, death, destruction and dislocation in Louisiana and Mississippi is so immense that one can hardly grasp it. Plenty of news sites and bloggers getting out the details but I need to put out my sympathy and condolences.</p>
<p>Poynter has a <a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=2&amp;aid=87986">list of vetted charities</a> gearing up to respond. Vivian and I donated today's take home pay to <a href="http://www.redcross.org/">the American Red Cross</a>. We hope anyone reading this can do the same to the ARC or any reputable group.</p>
<p>Of all the memes that have bounced around the web, Friday Fives and book lists, how about making this the next and most useful: Donate today's take home pay!</p>
