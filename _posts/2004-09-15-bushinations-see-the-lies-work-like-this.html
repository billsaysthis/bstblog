<p>Brent Muirhead's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/15/opinion/l15war.html?ex=1252987200&amp;en=a03e9b434a81986b&amp;amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland" title="scroll down to the third letter">Letter to the Editor</a> in today's Times is a perfect example of why President Bush's approval rating is as high as it is--people are easily fooled into believing what simply isn't true, especially if that untruth fits well with the person's previously-held opinions. In this case Muirhead conflates Al Qaeda and Iraq despite the results of every investigation before and after the US invasion of Iraq showing that there was no connection at all between bin Laden's group and Hussein's regime.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/15/opinion/l15bush.html?ex=1252987200&amp;en=10e6c6378d2c2f90&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">Another letter</a> shows the power of a different lie, the Republicans' efforts to discredit Kerry's service in Vietnam, though hopefully in the negative.</p>
<p>Making this a three-legged stool: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/15/opinion/15wed1.html?ex=1252987200&amp;en=c794387a03dc4843&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">an editorial</a> explaining the lies hiding the truth of Bush's Ownership Society promises. Sad that so many people look at plain truth and don't allow themselves to see it!<br /></p>
