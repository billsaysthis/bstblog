<p><strong>Ziff-Davis: really feeling the pinch</strong></p>
<p>eWeek, the former PCWeek, magazine used to be one of the most important publications in computerdom. Everyone wanted that free subscription but only a few were chosen. Then the Web came along and blew away the need for most print news publications, particularly those focused on computers. The Spencer F. Katt gossip column was one of the most enjoyable reads each week but lately it's totally fallen off. This week's effort, <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article/0,3658,s%253D707%2526a%253D20732,00.asp">Microsoft Leaks Another Glum Valentine</a>, isn't even original. As I wrote to the author in complaint:</p>
<p>Gee, nice of you to rerun week old Register stories:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/23518.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/23518.html</a></p>
<p>Heck I even wrote about in my weblog a week ago:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_12_30_blog_archive.phtml#8352401">http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_12_30_blog_archive.phtml#8352401</a></p>
<p>Another personal illusion sadly bites the dust.</p>
