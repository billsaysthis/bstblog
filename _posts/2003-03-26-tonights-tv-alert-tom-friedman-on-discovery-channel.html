<p>Tonight at 10, the Discovery Channel will broadcast a special written and hosted by NY Times columnist <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/opinion/FRIEDMAN-BIO.html">Thomas Friedman</a> called <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/schedule/episode.jsp?episode=0&amp;cpi=23772&amp;gid=0">Searching for the Roots of 9/11</a>. Description is "Featuring the three-time Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times columnist, Tom Friedman, viewers get a broad portrait of the roots of Muslim rage and the mistrust towards America. Friedman provides reports from Indonesia, Qatar, Egypt, Europe and beyond."</p>
<p>Friedman is an excellent, insightful writer (for example, today's column <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/26/opinion/26FRIE.html">Scorecard for the War</a>) and I will guess that he will put the hour on screen tonight to very good use. Try and catch it, live or Tivo'd.</p>
