<p>We were in Jersey this weekend to visit my family, which was really nice except for all that rain, snow and cold, and all was well, the Eagles went down in flames. But the Fates were not without their jokes. Trying to be a good son I volunteered to shovel my parents' short driveway. Of course there was a big icy patch and I fell. Turns out that thrusting one's hand out to stop the fall is not a great idea and to teach me that lesson I know have a splint wrapped around my hand for the next week. Uggh!</p>
