<p>Crumbling dirt and gravel are spread all over my jeans<br />
<br />As I sit behind a huge rocker wider than I am tall and<br />
<br />Taller than I am wide, a gnarly old tree in front of me.</p>
<p>I'm waiting for the sound of searching footsteps to<br />
<br />Move far enough away that I can't hear them moving<br />
<br />These people looking for me mean business and their<br />
<br />Business is meaner than I want to imagine and by all means<br />
<br />I want to stay strayed from their sight.</p>
<p>My chest is heaving, heavy breathing and I try to mute the<br />
<br />Sound so I can avoid the attention but my nerves are<br />
<br />Flaring as my head keeps churning from side to side.</p>
<p>These men (women?) chasing me have the wrong impression<br />
<br />The wrong idea and I should be home resting on a black couch<br />
<br />Instead of evading these people in black wearing sunglasses that<br />
<br />Hide their roaming eyes from the late morning sunshine that even<br />
<br />I can see cutting through the tree's branches and leaves.</p>
<p>Three hundred yards off I hear a stream rushing over rocks<br />
<br />So I argue with myself, is the sound is the noise loud enough<br />
<br />Close enough to cover me if I run to it, away from their guns.</p>
<p>Deciding is difficult, should I hear the spanging of bullets near me<br />
<br />I'm sure the fear will be as much as I can bear and more, yet<br />
<br />Sitting in place and not moving will not be wise much longer<br />
<br />The wrong thing to do and yet I am paralyzed with my brain racing<br />
<br />Right here between a rock and a hard place, for sure.<br /></p>
