<p>Paul Krugman's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/27/opinion/27KRUG.html">column today</a> in the NY Times explains how serious, methodical, and confident of success the Republican Party has become at realizing its goals. And this is not, NOT, a good thing. Krugman quote House Majority Leader Tom DeLay: "It never ceases to amaze me that people are so cynical they want to tie money to issues, money to bills, money to amendments." Remember, it's not too early to make a donation of time, <a href="https://www.democrats.org/epatriots/give.html?sourcecode=P000015">money</a>, or webspace in support of your choice for 2004 Democratic nominee or the Democratic Party. As garret <a href="http://dangerousmeta.com/posts/03/20030627#l">wrote</a>, it's far too early to give up on this fight.</p>
