<p>CocoaFilter: <a href="http://www.jhtc.org/event_detail.php?event_id=13">Tonight's JHTC meeting </a>will feature Pete Slosberg. Originally a rocket scientist, Pete decided to take on the world of beer and created Pete's Wicked Ale. Having scratched that itch, Pete's now bringing the same idealism and insight to chocolate with his new company, <a href="http://www.cocoapetes.com/">Cocoa Pete's Chocolate Adventures Company</a>.</p>

<p>Snarkfilter: Does Jack Black have the <a href="http://phototopia.typepad.com/phototopia/images/kerry_sisters_jack.jpg">smug look on his face</a> because he just did the Kerry daughters?</p>
<p>YaleFilter: From the school that gave us George Bush and John Kerry, in the same year no less, <a href="http://www.pornforprogress.com/">Porn for Progress</a>.</p>
<p>GonzoFilter: Hunter Thompson unleashes his nasty, visceral fountain pen on George Bush's ass in <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/_/id/6562575?&amp;rnd=1098396937233&amp;has-player=unknown">Fear and Loathing, Campaign 2004</a>. If you're familiar with his style, HST does not disappoint here.<br /></p>
