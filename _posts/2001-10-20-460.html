<p><b>Psst, they're on to us!</b></p>
<p>The tech press is usually pretty friendly towards tech vendors. After all, tech vendors buy the advertising, buy lots of the subscriptions, and sponsor and exhibit at the conferences. But CIO Magazine has published a customer rant on software quality, saying <a href="http://www.cio.com/archive/101501/wasting_content.html?printversion=yes">Let's Stop Wasting $78 Billion a Year</a>. They quote high level IT managers at major American companies who are just fed up with the perpetual beta-quality upgrades for which they pay more and more each year.
