<p><strong>Gone: Wendy's Dave Thomas</strong></p>
<p>And he really was Wendy's, not just the food chain he built but a daughter who loved him. Lovable Dave Thomas <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml;jsessionid=PAQKKZKQMKKZMCRBAE0CFFAKEEATGIWD?type=businessnews&amp;StoryID=500173">died today</a> at 69 after battling liver cancer. For the last 12 years he's made those lighthearted TV commercials even though he'd retired seven years before from the company. But he really was one of the good guys even if he couldn't choose between the sourdough bacon jack burger and the ham and chicken sandwich. His ad campaign has been running so long, I wonder if the company will try and use the new digital tech to make new commercials. Dave was adopted and about 10 years ago founded the <a href="http://www.davethomasfoundationforadoption.org/">Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption</a> to support adoptive families and organizations working to help them. Bye Dave, thanks for the value meals!</p>
