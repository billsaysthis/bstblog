<p>After a strong run the Reds came up against another of the big 4 and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/6116254.stm">were once again bodyslammed</a>. The team were able to hold Thierry Henry and Co. at bay for 40 minutes, allowing the Gunners most of the possession but no strong goal chances and making the most of their counterattacking opportunities.</p>
<p>Then Spanish teenage star Cesc Fabregas slid a cross to the feet of onrushing Mathieu Flamini and he pushed the ball the last two yards in, with Pepe Reina having no chance at a stop; the other two goals were from the two center backs, Toure and Gallas, on some very poor defending. Meanwhile the Reds best chance was from Peter Crouch, who knocked one in from an offside position and for the rest really never troubled last-minute sub keeper Manuel Almunia.</p>
<p>The result continues Liverpool's terrible away form in League matches. The team's only managed one goal in six matches, for a draw against Sheffield United on opening day--one point out of a possible 18--and leaves them 14 points off leader Manchester United and completely out of the title race once again. One does wonder whether Rafa Benitez will finally settle on a consistent first choice XI, with Gerrard in the center, now that Sissoko is out for months and Zenden is clearly better suited on the wing.</p>
<p>Fortunately the Reds are only four points back of fourth place Aston Villa, with all the teams in between reasonably climbable, and remain within reach of Champions League qualification. Though of course they can repeat their 2005 CL trophy hoisting and qualify through that route too ;)</p>
