<p>After what manager Rafa Benitez called their <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=168111&amp;cc=5901">best outing of the season</a> three days ago against Deportivo La Coruna in Champions League play, today saw their worst as the Reds <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=153171&amp;cc=5901">went  down 0 - 1 home to Birmingham</a>, though without Gerrard, Cisse and Baros and only Kewell up front as striker one does wonder where the goals were expected to be had.</p>
