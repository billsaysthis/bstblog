<p>Four days. 97 measly hours. 5833 minutes. Hmm, that last sounds more comfortable, I think. Anyway, that's the amount of time until the big day. Until the wedding ceremony for me and Vivian. Today's excitement about wrapped up the preparations. I drove over to her office at lunchtime and we made our way to the <a href="http://www.sccgov.org/site/0,4760,sid%253D11118,00.html" title="Let's just say these guys could use a website overhaul after some lessons in usability!">Santa Clara County Clerk/Recorder's Office</a> to get our <a href="http://www.sccgov.org/channel/0,4770,ccid%253D83965,00.html">marriage license</a>. The woman behind the counter, besides filling out forms and such, actually made us raise our right hands and take an oath! ROFL! I also picked up my snazzy new suit and dropped the source CDs off at a buddy's place (I'll keep his name away from the RIAA snoops). <em>Excitement builds!</em></p>
