<p>Soccernet said it best, so I'll just steal <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/match?id=54654&amp;cc=5901">their headline</a>. After 11 Premiership matches with no wins, only three short of the 50 year old record, the Reds finally took all three points from a match. Emile Heskey, whose demotion many LFC fans have been screaming for, was the man with the only goal scored. The FSN schedule called for the game to be shown live but the network switched at the last minute to Man United-Chelsea and it was only luck that a couple of hours later I turned back and found I'd only missed the first few minutes of a tape-delayed showing. Not lucky enough to see Heskey's handiwork but just afterwards. Cool. One can only hope they'll keep the form in a midweek Worthington Cup match against Sheffield United and then the big replay when the host league leading Arsenal on the 29th.</p>
