<p>"Give me your phone," Jamie said. "I need to get going and this will give me a way to stay in touch. What's the speed dial for your boss? What's his name, anyway?"</p>
<p>Lara looked over at him and he could tell that the blood loss was finally getting to her. That 15 minutes was feeling like a lot longer. "Alright but once you turn over the package you better destroy this. You don't want to have this phone tomorrow." She let out a short gasp and he could see the pain in her eyes. "My boss is name...his codename for this job is Stefan. Press Star One Send to get him. But only call him in an emergency, even our cellular connections aren't as secure as we'd like, and be brief."</p>
<p>He looked up, away from her for the first time in what seemed like ages but was only a few minutes. "Is there anything in your car I can get you, or a towel or shirt to put on the wound? I've never been up close and personal with anyone who was shot before, I don't know what to do for you."</p>
<p>"Just get going. The ambulance will be here in almost no time, they'll take care of me, and you want to be gone before then."</p>
<p>"Okay. Villa St. Roasting Company, Mountain View, man with a Toshiba laptop, browser open to the Times, Thai coffee, not white. Noon." She shook her head yes, with effort, and he could see in her eyes that the med techs better arrive soon. This was so not what he expected when he accidentally spilled her coffee, what, 45 minutes earlier. To almost be shot at and then get asked to play spy! He got up, looked around to see that there was, well, nothing special to see. Jamie looked back down at Lara.</p>
<p>"Alright then, I'm gone."</p>
