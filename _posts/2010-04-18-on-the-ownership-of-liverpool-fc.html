<p>A <a href="www.sportsfilter.com/news/14476/american-owners-put-liverpool-up-sale">recent SpoFi discussion</a> on Tom Hicks and George Gillette's quality as owners of the team brought this response from me:</p>
<p>Liverpool finished second in the Premiership last season, despite a horrendous number of draws (if three of them had been wins we'd have won the league), and made the Champions League semi-finals. This season has been less successful but we might still win the Europa League as consolation prize.</p>
<p>Under Hicks and Gillette we've bought Fernando Torres. Last Summer, okay we sold Xabi Alonso but with Real Madrid calling there was little chance of him not going. Meanwhile Benitez was given plenty to spend and paid millions of quid for Glen Johnson--good buy but injured much of the term--and Alberto Aquilani, a complete waste of well over $40M. Thankfully Lucas, a youngster Benitez has groomed filled in reasonably well considering its his first season as a regular starter.</p>
<p>Speaking of injuries, other than Dirk Kuyt and Pepe Reina almost all the team's important players have missed meaningful chunks of the season due to them.</p>
<p>I agree that Hicks and Gillette should probably not have taken on quite so much debt BUT if the economy had not gone so deep in the toilet the last two years I'm pretty sure this would be a non-issue for us, Man U and probably even Portsmouth.</p>
