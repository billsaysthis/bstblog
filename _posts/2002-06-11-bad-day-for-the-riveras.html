<p>Yesterday was <a href="http://msn.espn.go.com/mlb/news/2002/0610/1393131.html">not a good day</a> to be a New York Yankee and have the last name of Rivera. Ace reliever Mariano Rivera went on the disabled list for only the second time in his major league career with a strained right groin. The <em>other</em> Rivera, outfielder Juan, landed on the DL with what seems like a more serious problem, a fractured right kneecap. The Yankee machine just rolled right on by <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=220610110">defeating the Diamondbacks</a> and Randy Johnson with a late home run. The home run came from Marcus Thames playing in his first game up from the minors as Juan's replacement, one of three HRs the Yanks had in the game. giving them over 100 already this season.</p>
