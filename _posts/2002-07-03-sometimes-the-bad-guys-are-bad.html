<p>Business 2.0 published a powerful article by Paul Kaihla in its July issue: <a href="http://www.business2.com/articles/mag/print/0,1643,41206,00.html">The Technology Secrets of Cocaine Inc.</a>. Read in light of current events, this article to a certain degree refutes claims by Libertarian absolutists that restrictions on technology and oversight are always a bad thing. Certain pundits scream foul at the least invasive regulations but this article, unless it's a complete fabrication, shows beyond any reasonable doubt that the bad guys are no longer settling for pickup trucks and AK-47s but are using the latest technology to continue their operations.</p>
