<p>Scoble does <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/01/03/followup-to-chinese-thing-off-to-ces/">stand up against</a> the Microsoft Machine on <a href="http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/2006/01/microsoft_takes.html">the censorship of Michael Anti</a> though his response in the comments is underwhelming. Unlike apparent official blog spokesperson Michael Connolly, product unit manager for MSN Spaces, who <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/mc/Blog/cns%211pAYdbIaVKO599siMnBpCTdw%21927.entry">gives a mealymouthed explanation</a> of Microsoft’s position of why the company took down this pro-China democracy blog.</p>
<p>This is a tough issue which both Google and Yahoo have previously faced and also handled poorly, not to point the finger only at MSFT. It’s one which we need to find a better answer as a culture; as one of Scoble’s commenters said, why are we fighting for democracy in the Middle East but allowing US-flagged corporations to toss it aside as they like elswhere?</p>
