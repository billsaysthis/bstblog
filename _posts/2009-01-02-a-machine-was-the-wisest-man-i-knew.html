<p>A wise machine once said<br />When asked why it did not<br />Zoom off for its own singularity<br />That life just has too much fun left</p>
<p>Even as so many dark clouds form<br />Think of this sage advice at length<br />Before getting stuck in with gloom<br />As doom is no boon companion</p>
<p>This is no Pollyana-ish admonition<br />For naive Candide aspect on the world<br />Life is a complex set of needs, wants<br />Ranging randomly along the walk from 1 to 2</p>
<p>Do you want to be happy, the machine asked?<br />Then be happy, or at least permit yourself<br />The prospect of happiness as just reward for<br />Handling the twists a life throws up</p>
<p>Whatever's going on in the world at large<br />You can give yourself space to enjoy the<br />Passage of time, to savor the joy of<br />The few or many friends and family you have.</p>
