<p>Sunday I put up my brief opinions of all the Super Bowl commercials. Sunday night PBS had a half hour discussion of five of the ads, which I watched and thought was tres condescending, but thanks to iFilm, you can <a href="http://www.ifilm.com/superbowl">see all the ads</a> yourself. Don't miss the Budweiser New York, Levi's Crazy Legs and Cadillac Zeppelin spots. Bad Company and Rudy Guiliani Tribute are cool too.</p>
