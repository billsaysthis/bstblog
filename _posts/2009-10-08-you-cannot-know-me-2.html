<p>[Haven't posted a new poem in a while...]</p>
<p>You cannot know me<br />
You cannot breach the wall<br />
Of the Universe which<br />
Separates me from you</p>
<p>A camel is more likely to<br />
Sashay through a needle's eye<br />
No words shouted loudly or<br />
Seared into another's skin</p>
<p>Confusion sadly is part and parcel<br />
Questions go unanswered<br />
Philosophical investigations trail<br />
Off unto nothingness and always will</p>
<p>You cannot know me<br />
Men and women, tine after tine<br />
Have spent their lengthy lives<br />
Wasted in contemplation</p>
<p>What can you know?<br />
What do you see and hear?<br />
What are you able to do?<br />
What do you feel deep within?</p>
