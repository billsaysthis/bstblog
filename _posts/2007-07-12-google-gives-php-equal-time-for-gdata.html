<p>Having been involved with Blogger since before they had Pro accounts (I paid the $40 even though I was offered a freebie to support Ev and Co.), which was long before Google bought the company, and having co-authored of one of the earliest PHP libraries for the original Blogger API, I was very pleased to see today's announcement by Google of first class support for PHP in the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/blogger/developers_guide_php.html">GData Developer's Guide</a>.</p>
<p>Python, .Net and Java have been part of the DevGuide since it was opened (AFAIR) and I always wondered why PHP got left, since Zend has long had the necessary open source code available via the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a>. The Googlers are institutionally tight-lipped so an answer on that is unlikely to come out. Anyway, the support is out now, which is great.</p>
<p>The GData API is Google's ATOM-based interface for programmatically connecting to Blogger as well as many other web services offered by the web giant, including Calendar, Code Search, Picasa and Spreadsheets. I use it on BillSaysThis mainly to supply content for the Book Reviews page, which is fairly simplistic, but other people have written full-blown interactive blogging clients with it.</p>
<p>Big thumbs up to the Blogger team for today's release.</p>
