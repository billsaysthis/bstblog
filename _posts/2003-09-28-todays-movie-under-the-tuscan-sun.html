<p>Diane Lane, heartbreak, and the beauty of Tuscany combine for a decent, but not great, movie. <a href="http://tuscansun.movies.go.com/main.html">Under the Tuscan Sun</a> is inspired by the book of the same name and Lane does play a character with the name Frances Mayes (the author of the autobiographical travelogue), but there was no story in the book, so writer/director Audrey Wells just made a bunch of crap up.</p>
<p>Wells has specialized in chick flicks so far in her career (<em>The Truth About Cats and Dogs</em>, <em>Guinevere</em>, next year's English language remake of <em>Shall We Dance?</em> starring Richard Gere and J.Lo) and <em>Tuscan Sky</em> certainly falls into the same...pit. Now, I'm not saying this simply because the main character is a woman but because the character has the heartache and bad breaks piled on, yet fights her way to emotional stability with only the help of a few wise friends. Plus lots of foreshadowing, can't forget the foreshadowing.</p>
<p>Tuscany is beautiful, Lane/Mayes meets up with colorful, if blemished, characters. Everyone calls her Francesca, even the slightly loony older English actress (think a mid-50s English Kim Catrell-ish <em>Sex and the City</em> type) who befriends her. She has a heart-opening affair with a wonderful Italian man who conveniently (for the plot) lives hours away in the South (Positano, not far down the Amalfi Coast from where I vacationed back in 2001). She even gets everything she asks for in the end. Yeah, it's a chick flick though not a bad one--just like <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0117718/">Spitfire Grill</a> a few years ago.</p>
<p>Note: Yes, this does not mean I've in any way changed my mind from <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_09_21_blog_archive.phtml#106416408262975811">last week's rant</a>, we saw this movie at the <a href="http://www.cineluxtheatres.com">CineLux</a> theater in Almaden.</p>
<p><em>Recommended for date nights</em></p>
