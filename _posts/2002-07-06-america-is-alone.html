<p>Criticism comes in from all directions: Europe says we are arrogant, Islam says we are corrupt, Africa says we don't do enough to help, and South America says our drug habits are causing their domestic problems. <a href="http://denbeste.nu">Steven</a> has written extensively on why this is happening and why we are right, most of the time, to react and respond as we do. Now even the NY Times has publicly agreed with him: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/06/weekinreview/07dao.html">One Nation Plays the Great Game Alone</a>.</p>
