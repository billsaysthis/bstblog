<p>Even though it wasn't a get rich quick scheme, the US Men's team pulled out a draw with a late goal off a header by Carlos Bocanegra, crossed in on a corner by Landon Donovan. The Polish goal midway through the second half came off a sweet cross through the box that Tim Howard, getting a rare start in goal, tipped when he should have let it pass. At least we kept a six game streak without a loss alive. Landon was all over the field all game and Brian Ching had several really nice touches after coming on in the 66th minute. Next up is the group round of World Cup qualifying, August 18.</p>
