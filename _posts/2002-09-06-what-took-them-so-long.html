<p>Weren't you waiting (perhaps with bated breath) for The Doors to reunite? Well, at least the living members who aren't sidelined by ear disease? I know I was! Screw Jim Morrison! Well, your wait is ending. Ray Manzarek, the keyboardist who wouldn't shut up, and Robby Krieger, the quiet one with the funny hair, have decided the world has waited long enough and are <a href="http://launch.yahoo.com/read/news.asp?contentID=210343">now touring as The Doors</a> and plan to record and release an album next Spring.</p>
<p>Since John Densmore is sidelined with the hearing disorder tinnitus, Stewart Copeland will be sitting in on drums. You remember him, from the Police, and I suppose since he hasn't had a hit in all the years since that group broke up he needs to put a few dollars in the bank. The singer will be <a href="http://www.chartattack.com/gallery/20011029-thecult.jpg">Ian Astbury</a> of The Cult and, for the first time, a bassist (some unknown guy from Krieger's band). Astley's former group <a href="http://launch.yahoo.com/artist/artistFocus.asp?artistID=1006288">never really settled</a> on what they were about but they seemed to move from one commercial vein to another before sputtering out.</p>
<p>This move is somewhat surprising. Only two months ago Densmore published <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20020708&amp;s=densmore">a screed in The Nation</a> decrying the increasing sale of classic rock songs for use in commercials; he didn't just criticize the concept, he named names. If Manzarek and Krieger want to play together again, fine. Without Morrison to sing and write, just don't call it The Doors. Admit that its all about the money because if it was just about the music, they would have chosen a different name.</p>
<p>Apparently, this is <a href="http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2002/07/0541.cfm" title="Published in July">not such new news</a> but have you heard about it? I hadn't. ChartAttack.com claims in that article that The Doors were {"desperate to do a reunion tour since they saw old buddies like The Who and the dudes from Led Zeppelin raking in the cash."</p>
