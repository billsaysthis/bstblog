<p><strong>Micro-advertising experiment, day three</strong></p>
<p>The Clickthrough Ratio is edging up to 1.35%, although that means nine clicks on <a href="http://www.accessnewage.com/articles/humor/JOKE666.htm">666</a> viewings. I left the wording the same as in the Blogger ad but I think I need to work on it for next time, if there is a next time.</p>
