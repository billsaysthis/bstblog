<p>Okay, I may not be the UPI Business and Economics Editor like Martin Hutchinson but his column <a href="http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20031210-053039-3725r">Analysis: It's 1973, not 1929</a> seems to be far too stuck in trying to correlate the past with the present than understanding the differences between 1929, 1973 and 2003.</p>
