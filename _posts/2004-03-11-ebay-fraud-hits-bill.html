<p>Checking my email this morning I found one from some guy who'd searched me out after smelling something off in <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=3709786670&amp;category=38083" title="Not sure how durable this link will be...">an eBay auction</a> of a 1979 Fender Telecaster. Same kind as I own. I guess he did a little googling and found <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/telecaster">my Telecaster for Sale page</a>, then wrote to check things out.</p>
<p>Sure enough, this bottom feeder is attempting to sell my guitar, is using my guitar's serial number and the photos right off my web page! Damn! I sent an alert to the eBay police but not sure what, if anything, will happen as the automated response was less than crystal on that score. Seemed strange to me but there wasn't even space in the reporting form to include more than the auction number, no place to include an explanation. Still, at least I've done my part and hopefully no one will be taken by this apparent crooked deal, which "Ends Mar-11-04 10:34:56 PST" anyway.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Well, not sure what will happen but someone did in the end submit a bid above the $700 minimum set by the seller (<a href="http://contact.ebay.com/ws1/eBayISAPI.dll?ShowCoreAskSellerQuestion&amp;requested=shahards&amp;iid=3709786670&amp;frm=284">shahards</a>) and was declared "the winner." I do wonder, though, if he wasn't part of the seller's fraud network (or even another account of the same person) and simply gave a shill bid in order to improve the seller's rating. Guess it's not really my problem any more.</p>
