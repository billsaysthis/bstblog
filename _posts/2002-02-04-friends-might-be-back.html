<p>Neither network NBC nor producer Warner Brothers want this eighth season to be the last one of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Friends/index.html">Friends</a>, although a few months ago that's how the situation was shaping up. Reports this week though say that negotiations are going on to bring the cast back and that the talks wouldn't be going on if the six friends weren't open to the notion. This year each of them gets $750,000 per episode for 22 episodes. The rumor says to come back will cost $1-1.1 million per episode per friend. That's at least $22 million per friend for the season, $132 million for the lot. But this year has seen the show come back with strong storylines, especially Joey/Rachel and Rachel's pregnancy, so next year dealing with the baby in this triangle could be ripe. I'm open to the idea.</p>
