<p>Bruce opened three nights of concerts at Shea Stadium last night; the last, which is the final show of this year's tour, is Saturday and I surely wish I could be there. Not only for the band's incredible music but because the man is finally getting directly and unamiguously into politics in a way that he's essentially avoided thoughout his career.</p>
<p><em>Springsteen wove strong criticism of the administration of President Bush into the first of the final three shows at Shea Stadium on Wednesday night, playing a recording of Bush talking about weapons of mass destruction, questioning America's motives for the war in Iraq and calling for Bush's defeat as he seeks re-election next year. "It is time to impeach the president and put in somebody that knows what they're doing," <a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=musicNews&amp;storyID=3549238">Bruce told the audience</a>.</em></p>
<p>Bruce's name has been bandied about for political office, always by others and immediately disclaimed by Springsteen himself, but I would so like to see him run for the US Senate from New Jersey. One can only imagine that he would be more electable than the Governator is out here and much more honest and able to boot. Frank Lautenberg is only a year into his term and Jon Corzine three, so we can still get another record from him first. But Bruce, I really think the time has come for you to think long and hard about how you might best contribute to America.</p>
