<p><b>Man Wanted in Abortion Anthrax Hoaxes Held</b></p>
<p>Clayton Lee Waagner, an anti-abortion terrorist, was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml;jsessionid=RMXVV53UYYO2GCRBAE0CFEYKEEATGIWD?type=topnews&amp;StoryID=432521">arrested today</a> near Cincinnati. Waagner, as <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_11_25_blog_archive.phtml#7514268">previously discussed</a> in this weblog, is a psychotic Douglas Adams fan who made creditable threats to kill a large number of abortion clinic workers without warning. I'm really glad to read that he's been arrested before he could go ahead and harm anyone. Waagner had been on a crime spree across the eastern US since he escaped from an Illinois jail last February. He apparently was recognized by employees at a Kinko's where he was renting some computer time and the local police were alerted. Way to go guys!</p>
