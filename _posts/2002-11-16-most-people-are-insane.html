<p>Me too, not trying to pull that particular piece of wool over anyone's eyes. Shows up in different ways with different people. John Allen Muhammed, Osama Bin Laden, Admiral John Poindexter, Ken Lay, Dusty Baker, those are some easy and obvious ones currently in the public view. A friend passed along a link to <a href="http://www.extremeironing.com/ei/homepage/main.php">ExtremeIroning.com</a> last night.</p>
<p>Extreme Ironing is, in their own words, "the latest danger sport that combines the thrills of an extreme outdoor activity with the satisfaction of a well pressed shirt." These goofballs even held a <a href="http://www.extremeironing.com/ei/teamgb/diary.php">World Championship</a> in September! And let's not forget about the <a href="http://www.extremeironing.info/">German Extreme Ironing Section</a> and the <a href="http://www.ironing.at/tours/body.htm">Austrian Ironing Team</a>. There are many pictures of the absurdity on these websites (and others as well, I'm sure) but here is one photo that should give you some idea of the depths of this brand:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ironing.at/rettenstein/pictures/viewer_001.htm"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pict_001.jpg" alt="Austrian extreme ironer" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>Furthermore, today is the day for all you hand fiends: the <a href="http://www.worldrps.com/champ.html">2002 International Rock Paper Scissors Championships</a> are going down tonight in Toronto.</p>
<p>I leave the answer as to my own form of insanity, in the tradition of K&amp;R, as an exercise for the reader.</p>
