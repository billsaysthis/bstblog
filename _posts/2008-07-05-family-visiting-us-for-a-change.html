<p>My great aunt Edith is 100 years old this year and so a big Lazar family celebration was organized for this weekend, with cousins and spouses traveling here from all over the US (Edith lives in San Francisco). My father, sister and nephew came from back east and our new house was ready just in time for them to stay with us.</p>
<p>This afternoon we all met up at my uncle Martin and aunt Wendy's place in San Jose; this is the first time I've been with so many relatives since, oh, maybe my first wedding back in '87, maybe longer. The core group was my great uncle Nate, my dad and his six first cousins: Norm, who was great to me when I lived near him in college; Norm's older brother Irv; Andrea, who lives just down Middlefield from us; Eleanor; Arthur, son of the birthday lady; and our host Martin. Plus a bunch of the cousin's kids came from near and far. Martin's two daughters both have babies, who spent most of the afternoon sleeping or looking cute.</p>
<p>There were several pro (Eleanor's husband Tom) and semi-pro photographers, so I'm sure I'll get pics to post soon. Meanwhile, here are two I snapped with the phone:</p>

<p>Tomorrow Edith will come down for the party at Andrea's house and Sunday the inner circle are having lunch with her in San Francisco. What a great holiday, eh?</p>
