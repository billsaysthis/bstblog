<p>Latest in a continuing series of post in which I attempt to express my disgust and disdain for politicians who are so obviously bought and paid for. Fritz Hollings, the Senator from Disney, has given up even trying to hide this. I wish I could get into one of his press conferences and just ask him how he feels about this nickname. Of course he would probably just doubletalk it away. Maybe if I could get some truth serum into his pre-conference glass of water...</p>
<p>- Hollings has introduced a bill that would <a href="http://salon.com/tech/feature/2002/04/26/hollings_spyware/index.html">protect spyware</a>. This article goes into detail on just why Brilliant Digital's spyware Altnet software is so unsettling and how Hollings' bill will give corporations legal cover.</p>
<p>- Several media and consumer electronics companie have reached agreement on adding copy protection to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A49941-2002Apr25.html">digital TVs</a>, removing our rights to do something as simple and basic as time-shifting programs, and now they want Congress to turn their private contracts into law.</p>
<p>- <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/national/AP-Cheney-Documents.html">Memo Shows Influence of Lobbyist</a> in formulating Bush stance on regulating carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p>I guess <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_04_21_blog_archive.phtml#85027558">it isn't just</a> the energy companies that are involved in the takeover.</p>
