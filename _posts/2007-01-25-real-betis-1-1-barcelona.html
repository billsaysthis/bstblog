<p>As part of straightening out my issues with Comcast and HD, I ended up getting the Spanish language channel football network GolTV and watched an entire match today, with La Liga leading (and reigning Europe champion) Barcelona FC visiting bottom dwelling Real Betis.</p>
<p>Barca is missing a bunch of players through injury, including strikers Samuel Eto'o and Lionel Messi, but given their lineup I still expected them to dominate the game. Real Betis was the bright team this day, scoring first and holding on for the <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sow/news;_ylt=AnqQvTLgiSWR4t5pJWO4Y0Mmw7YF?slug=reu-spain_picture&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns">1-1 draw</a>. The hosts were much more aggressive and their midfielder Assuncao took some blistering wicked free kicks that came very close to sneaking just inside Victor Valdes' post.</p>
<p>Frankly, if this is the team that shows up against Liverpool in four weeks for the Champions League round then I think our club has a much better chance to go through than before I watched the game. Ronaldinho still has not regained his rampant form of the last two seasons and Deco was rarely able to connect with Saviola and Giuly upfront; however Eto'o and Messi may both be back by then so I doubt the Reds will have an easy time as Real Betis did today.</p>
