<p>Boy, oh boy, between work and soccer and TV and keeping up my web reading, three days have passed since my last post. What a bummer. I don't really have much to say tonight but will substitute some linkage instead:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/?p=6836">sensor sweep</a></p>
<p>DV blog <a href="http://darthside.blogspot.com/2005/05/parenting-101.html">still funny<br /></a><br /><a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20050505.html">dayjet scheduling software</a> cool stuff</p>
<p>bud gibson <a href="http://thecommunityengine.com/home/archives/2005/02/the_difference.html">contrasts tags</a> on delicious and technorati, comments by <a href="http://vanderwal.net/random/">Vander Wal</a> argue a different interpretation</p>
<p>peter meerholz argues that <a href="http://www.peterme.com/archives/000451.html">tags are an emergent information source</a> of their own different from pure metadata</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000361.php">meerholz again</a>: "footworn paths" over time show where people want to walk, not where they're told to walk</p>
<p><a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/tgn/">Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names</a></p>
<p>Don't panic--your tags are your own and don't need to compete, compare or connect to what anyone else uses, even for the same page. Serendipity will lead to these connection over time anyway. If you widen your search to the master RawSugar database, you'll see what tags other people have used for the same pages and what pages other people have given the tags you use.</p>
