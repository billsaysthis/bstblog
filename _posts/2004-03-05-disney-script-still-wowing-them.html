<p>Or not, perhaps. On the one hand <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/05/business/media/05DISN.html?ex=1393822800&amp;en=d0a516ea07816a0a&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">George Mitchell says</a> his role as chairman is not the usual strategic leadership but instead will be focusing on winning back dissafected shareholders. On the other, still-standing <a href="http://news.ft.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=FT.com/StoryFT/FullStory&amp;c=StoryFT&amp;cid=1078381533427&amp;p=1012571727304">CEO Michael Eisner says</a> he "would address shareholder concerns by focusing '100 per cent of my time' on rebuilding earnings at the company." Eisner further said Eisner said: "It allows me and the rest of the management more time to run the operations of the company and give up a lot of the responsibility I had as chairman."</p>
<p>If you ask me, these two statements of their respective responsibilities are in pretty direct conflict with each other and I believe the Disney PR staffers better get the leadership talking from the same script ASAP. The two will have a tough enough time getting shareholder confidence back as it is without this kind of muck-up.</p>
