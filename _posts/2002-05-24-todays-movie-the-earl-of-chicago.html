<p>I bet you never heard of this one either. But thanks to the magic of Tivo Suggests, I ended up with 1940's <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0032424">The Earl of Chicago</a> on my playlist and on a whim watched it. Robert Montgomery plays the title character, a Chicago mobster who becomes an English lord through an accident of birth, with a kind of Edward G. Robinson pseudo-impersonation and an odd little nervous laugh. <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Arnold,+Edward">Edward Arnold</a> plays the lawyer who Montgomery framed and then befriends. Edmund Gwenn plays the perfect English butler. I thought this was a comedy, to be honest, until the ending.</p>
<p>Director Richard Thorpe, who started in mass-produced silent Westerns and went on to make <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0044760">some</a> <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0045053">classics</a> and some <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0050556">Elvis</a> <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0057083">flicks</a>, doesn't do much in this movie at all but that's not too surprising since <em>Earl</em> is one of three movies he directed in 1940. Lesser Samuels wrote the screenplay and he ought to get the blame, I suppose. <em>Not recommended</em></p>
