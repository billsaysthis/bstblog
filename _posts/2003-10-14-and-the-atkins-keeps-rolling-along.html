<p><a href="http://www.al.com/printer/printer.ssf?/base/news/1066123090290560.xml">Another study: Low-carb diet works</a> - of course it does. If only more researchers would actually do validated studies, we might get past the AMA-elitist attitudes that are holding back more people from using this strategy to get healthy.</p>
<p>Some new products I expect to sample in the coming days: <a href="http://forum.lowcarber.org/showthread.php?t=105333">Soy Slender</a>, sugar free Soy milk that comes in vanilla and chocolate, is low carb and sweetened with Sucralose. <a href="http://www.chefschoicelowcarb.com/">Chef's Choice Lo-Carb Bowls</a> are a line of prepared meals that leave out the portion of starch (rice, pasta or potato) that ruin the typical frozen meals for Atkins adherents.</p>
