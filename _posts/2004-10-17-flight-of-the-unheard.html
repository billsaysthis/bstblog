<p>Rough metal shapes hover over tall trees<br />
<br />Reflecting light from cars driving on a highway<br />
<br />Off in the distance, drivers making their way<br />
<br />Home and elsewhere in the early morning hours.</p>
<p>I can see them looking out the upstairs window,<br />
<br />Missing a yellow Beetle that's normally a landmark<br />
<br />Parked out on the street that tells me my home is<br />
<br />Just a few normal breaths and wheel turns away.</p>
<p>Momentum carries those cars up and over the<br />
<br />Rise, beyond the green, out of my sight, though<br />
<br />They aren't of much concern to me, I'm looking<br />
<br />For something they don't carry, something in the night.</p>
<p>In front of my eyes, into my eyes, in through my eyes<br />
<br />Come complete signals carrying information<br />
<br />Not meant for the likes of you or me, not ready,<br />
<br />Released too soon and there will be a breakdown</p>
<p>The darkness is dotted with those shapes,<br />
<br />Barely visible messages painted in barely visible<br />
<br />Colors in barely understandable scrabbles<br />
<br />And they twist and turn in the midnight wind</p>
<p>Dangerously a paradox whispers from the nightstand<br />
<br />Radio, trying to reinforce the metallic messages<br />
<br />Trying to break through the filtering screen<br />
<br />No words no teeth no mouth no freedom.<br /></p>
