<p><strong>More Internet troubles for Bill</strong></p>
<p>Poor me. If the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/ce/recap/0,3762,NFL_20020106_GB@NYG,00.html">Giants losing to the Packers</a> wasn't bad enough, now I am have weird problems with MS Internet Explorer. For several reasons I'm still using that software (<a href="http://www.evhead.com">Ev</a>, are you listening?) rather than Opera and now I can't access any web sites even though email and other Internet tools (like TextRouter and Opera) work fine. ATT Broadband support says there is a problem with the Winsock files on my computer but they can't help fix it, I need MS support for that. But the support line there isn't open on Sundays. Uck-fay!</p>
