<p>Good: Liverpool beat Fulham, at Fulham, 2-1 on a late penalty kick into the back of the net by the renewed Danny Murphy and an early swat by Emile Heskey. The Reds wasted a lot of the match with poor keepaway in their own half, allowing the Cottagers (gotta love that nickname, you'd <em>never</em> see it on an American team in any sport) to hang around and nearly win.</p>
<p>Not as nice was the performance of Michael Owen, whose name was only heard during the broadcast being called for offside and who is the subject of transfer rumors which have him going to Real Madrid in the January window for over US$40 million. As if the Spanish side needed <a href="http://www.realmadrid.com/web_realmadrid/templates/plantilla/primeraplantillafutbol.jsp">another striker</a> when they have Raul and Ronaldo plus a buttload of world class attacking midfielders.</p>
<p>Good: BCS doesn't come until tomorrow but both <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/rankings?poll=1" title="Not a permanent link">AP</a> and <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/rankings?poll=2" title="Not a permanent link">ESPN/USA Today</a> have USC at Number Two! Good things come when you score so many points and the other team doesn't. Oklahoma, not surprisingly, got all the first place votes in both polls.</p>
<p>Shocking: The 49ers' Cedric Wilson took the opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown, then the Rams answered with a field goal. Tim Rattay drove the Niners 72 yards ending with a short touchdown pass to Terrell Owens and later threw a bit long but rookie receiver Brandon Lloyd was able to lay out and grab it for another TD. Todd Peterson made all three PATs and a 44 yard FG, putting some equilibrium in the kicking game after the mess that was Pochman. Niners defense was stellar as well as Marc Bulger was under strong pressure most pass plays, finally resulting in a Tony Parrish interception. Halftime score: 49ers 24, Rams 3.</p>
<p>How does the second half start? More of the same as Bulger holds onto the ball too long and Bryant Young strips it from him. A Garrison Hearst rush and two Rattay passes put another six on the board (Peterson's PAT was blocked), with Tai Streets making a terrific grab in tight coverage. San Francisco has certainly gotten the better of the officiating up to this point but St. Louis got a little makeup with two unearned penalties that combined gave them first and goal at the one on their next drive. Mike Martz then blew it by challenging an obvious incomplete pass and wasting a timeout, after which Bulger had another pass batted down by the DLine on fourth down. Seventh straight time a 49er QB won their debut start.</p>
<p>Really makes me wonder how the fuck the 49ers lost to Arizona last week.</p>
<p>Amusing: The Raiders never even led at Detroit and lost 23-13. They also lost their backup QB Marques Tuiasosopo who was starting today due to Rich Gannon's injured shoulder but the Raiders were already losing 10-0 on points scored off turnovers at the time. Career failure Rick Mirer finished up.</p>
