<p>Great result for Liverpool, another 3-1 victory over Bayern Leverkusen,  in today's Champions League matchup and now Rafa says <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/headlinenews?id=327255&amp;cc=5901">"We can go all the way"</a>. Would be nice to see just a bit more consistency, there's little room left in the EPL standings to reach fourth place and guarantee a return to this competition next season. Chelsea was the other English side to move to the Quarterfinals, along with AC Milan, Juventus, PSV Eindhoven, Lyon, Bayern Munich and the winner of the FC Porto/Inter Milan pairing (second leg is next Tuesday); Arsenal lived down to their European reputation again while Manchester United could never get van Nistelrooy or Rooney unleashed and ended their round with no goals at all. The draw for the last eight is next Friday and there is not a single easy matchup for the Reds, in fact I'm sure just about all the other teams are crossing their fingers to draw <em>us</em>. We'll see how that goes, next game is in early April.</p>
