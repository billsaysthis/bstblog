<p>As another annoyance-avoidance tool I revised the access controller for the site to block hotlinking of files (using <a href="http://underscorebleach.net/jotsheet/2004/06/htaccess-prevent-hotlinking">Tom Sherman's guidance</a>) by other websites. If this means you see a broken image or red x in a box where you expect to see a photo, that's why. I made exceptions for SportsFilter, Bloglines and Google but if you think there should be others please let me know.</p>
