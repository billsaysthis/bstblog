<p>Let me try and make this simple:
<ul>
<li>I have not enjoyed any movie directed by Jay Russell</li>
<li>I have not enjoyed any movie written by Lewis Colick</li>
<li>Joaquin Phoenix? Okay, <em>Gladiator</em> was cool but that was hardly about him though I have hopes for <em>Walking the Line</em> his upcoming Johnny Cash biopic as long as he doesn't tr and sing.</li>
<li>Travolta, okay, he's done some good shit going back to the beginning though he's had his share of dogs and recent years have been a bit hit or miss</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://video.movies.go.com/ladder49/main.html">Ladder 49</a> is definitely one for Travolta's miss column. The idea is decent, a look at the career of a brave young firefighter as his life hangs in the balance, but the execution is trite. And Phoenix, maybe it's his acting skills or voice and face, but he comes off as playing a girl. I don't mean that in a covert homosexual slap or women belong in the kitchen way but he's supposed to be playing a man's man and doesn't pull it off. Not even close.</p>
<p>I also never felt attached to his character so the life hanging in the balance scenes that were intended to keep me gripped to the seat didn't. The crumbling, flaming huge building interior where they took place--the film's big fire--had all the necessary visual appeal but didn't make sense, I wasn't given enough information to explain why the fire was playing out as it did.</p>
