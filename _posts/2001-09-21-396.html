<p><b>Some go to the deep end</b></p>
<p>Andrea Peyser writes in the tabloid NY Post that the <a href="http://www.nypost.com/commentary/32767.htm">AMERICA-BASHING U.N. SHOULD GET LOST</a>, that "the once-shiny beacon of peace has devolved into a cancer, where all manner of anti-American lunacy is hatched. The U.N. functions as an international megaphone through which every Third World dictatorship vents its fury at our way of life." Peyser minces no words, calling CNN international correspondent a "war slut."</p>
<p>I'm not familiar with this woman's writing but the other piece by her currently on the Post's website is similar in attitude: <a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/09182001/commentary/4350.htm">BEWARE BUMS WHO BLAME U.S..</a></p>
