<p>Wondering why so many people are frustrated by the difficulty in even getting an interview to work at Google? I see many requests for contacts and other information from folks on the ProMatch and JHTC mailing lists, but I don't think there is much to be done for most of them. <a title="link may be blocked after 7/30/04" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/business/technology/9229359.htm?1c">Lawsuit charges Google with age discrimination</a> gives some insight:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>During his tenure at Google, Reid said he gathered evidence that Google purposely avoids hiring older workers. Just 2 percent of Google's roughly 1,900 employees are under 30 years old, according to the suit. The average age of Google's male workers was 29.7 years old and the average age of women was 28.4 years old when Reid left.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Of course there is also the firm's penchant for hiring only people with higher level technical degrees even for non-technical positions. An MBA, especially a 17 year old one like I have, probably doesn't seem to add much value in this perception.</p>
<p>Note that this is not to say I'm in any way unhappy at Intransa. Rather more aimed at the experience I had hunting prior to joining up there. Hell, I even have a couple of well-placed contacts inside who couldn't get me in for an interview for specific openings for which I was well-qualified and I do believe my age was a factor.</p>
