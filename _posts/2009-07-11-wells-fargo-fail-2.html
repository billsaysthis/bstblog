<p>Do you know that Wells Fargo will take any reason to switch retail customers to online only statements?
<div>
<ol>
<li>If there are two people on an account and one chooses online only statements and the other chooses online and paper (the only two options), Wells Fargo will force the account to be online only. Even though the other choose is more inclusive and customer-friendly.</li>
<li>Customer are asked constantly, nearly every time one logs in to their online system, to switch to online only statements. I mean for years on and on. I guess its too much to think that answering a question once, or maybe twice, would be good enough.</li>
</ol>
<div>Forget about trying to get a straight answer from the customer service reps. I don't blame the individuals, they're only following instructions handed down from on high, but since customers can only speak with the front line reps I guess we're stuck.</div>
