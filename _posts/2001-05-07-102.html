<p><b>Art Online: Mondrian's Broadway Boogie-Woogie</b>
<p>I really enjoy Piet Mondrian's paintings. I like the way he stays with discrete colors and shapes and usually gives the eye something complex to look at using a fairly constrained palette of objects. The Museum of Modern Art, New York has posted this <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/paintsculpt/mondrian.broadway.html">1942 piece</a> online as part of an extensive <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/paintsculpt/index.html">collection</a>; each piece is accompanied by commentary in both text and audio form. Unfortunately, the site does not include search or index facilities for easy navigation.</p>
