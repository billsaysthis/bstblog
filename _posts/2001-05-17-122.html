<p><b>Forbes asks and answers some wacky and some serious questions</b><br />

<p>Probably best if you can skim this one--I've linked to the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/asap/2001/0528/024_print.html">printable version of the article</a> since the basic(?) version is 14 pages. One of the best: "Will a cell phone stop a bullet as well as a Bible does?</p>
<p>After months of testing this out in the Forbes ASAP benchmark laboratory, we can safely say that the prize still goes to the Bible. According to Mike Hill, engineering professor at the University of California at Davis, 'The flexible and fibrous Good Book will stand more of a chance of stopping a bullet. The brittle cell phone, replete with mechanical inhomogeneities, is unlikely to withstand the force.' On the other hand, the word inhomogeneities might stop a bullet by itself."</p>
