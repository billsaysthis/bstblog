<blockquote>"There has been a strong favour for the number Seven, from a remote period in the world's history. But a sort of mystical goodness or power has attached itself to the number in many other ways. Seven wise men, seven champions of Christendom, seven sleepers, seven-league boots, seven churches, seven ages of man, seven hills, seven senses, seven planets, seven metals, seven sisters, seven stars, seven wonders of the world,â€”all have had their day of favour." From <a href="http://www.thebookofdays.com/months/jan/26.htm">The Book of Days</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Today is the seventh squared anniversary of my entrance on the stage of life. Not typically a major milestone but perhaps all the remarks about the big one coming next year have had me a bit thoughtful the last few days.</p>
<p>I'm luckier than most, no doubt, so don't think I'm crying in my beer or anything. I have a beautiful, loving wife, terrific parents and sister, an affectionate little puppy and some good friends. We have a fine house in a quite neighborhood in a town we enjoy.</p>
<p><a href="http://tweetphoto.com/21079291"><img class="alignleft" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/x2_141a4fb" alt="" width="79" height="79" /></a>Still... I look at my Twitter feed and see a school friend, whose current novel debuted at #1 on the NY Times Bestseller list, <a href="http://tweetphoto.com/21079291">in a picture with Jack Nicholson</a> and the governor of New Jersey (who was a year or so behind me at high school). Another classmate is now the chief economist at the Treasury Department and a tenured professor at Princeton. Another has moved even further from our hometown than me, living in Shanghai the last eight years.<br style="clear:both;" /></p>
<p>I haven't written that great thriller screenplay or science fiction novel that's been my ambition since I can remember. The time for my SaaS software idea has come and gone, it seems. Never bought the winning ticket for a $100 million lottery prize.</p>
<p>But hey, I'm not 50 yet. I've got plenty of time to do all of them and since I'm a lucky guy you know one of these days I will!</p>
