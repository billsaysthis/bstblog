<p>I guess Rails is as popular as you'd expect in this area since I can't find a single bookstore listed on the O'Reilly site that has <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/097669400X/">Agile Web Development with Rails</a> in stock. Since this title, co-authored by Rails' creator, is the only book to come out as yet I'll be waiting for new shipments to arrive. TS1, always the sweetie, popped over to Tower this morning to check for me on her shopping rounds with the same result.</p>
