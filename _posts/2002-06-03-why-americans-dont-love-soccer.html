<p>Every commentator says the reason soccer isn't more popular here in the States is because of the predominantly low scores. May I beg to differ? I think the real reason is that soccer is simply too casual, too loose. Watch the play after a foul, when a player gets in the general vicinity of the spot where it occured he just spins the ball in front of him and kicks it. Watch after a ball goes out of bounds, when a player takes several steps passed where the ball went out and tosses it into play. Consider that the clock doesn't stop for goals and injuries and instead the referee keeps track in his handwatch.</p>
<p>All those go against the American grain. NBA shot clocks go into tenths of a second. NFL fields are marked with every yard and use chains to measure for first downs. Even the NHL uses instant replay on disputed goals.</p>
<p>Then there is the issue of control. In American sports, the head coach/manager retains very close rein on the action, in many situations running onto the field/court to argue individual calls. In soccer, once play starts the coach has very little to do when the ball is in play except to send his (at most) three substitutes.</p>
<p>Sure, Americans would probably find the game more exciting with more scoring. One could make a similar comment about hockey although that sport continues to make headway; I expect that seeing the Carolina Hurricanes make their franchise first-ever Stanley Cup Finals appearance this week will light up the South, especially if the series goes six or seven games.</p>
<p>But Americans are a pretty uptight bunch and I think that's the real reason soccer, the ultimate in sport everywhere else, goes nowhere in the U.S.</p>
