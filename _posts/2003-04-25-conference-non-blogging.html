<p>This is not a real time report from the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etcon/">O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference</a> but I did drop by the happening at the Westin this afternoon for an hour. I didn't have near the good time that <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/04/24.html#a2851">Scoble did</a> and even though I looked around I didn't see him. The only person I met up with was the estimable <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org">Matt Haughey</a>, creator and proprietor of <a href="http://www.metafilter.com">MetaFilter</a> and so much more, who actually realized who I was from my name tag; he was there manning the Creative Commons booth. I wanted to see <a href="http://www.shellen.com/jason/archives/2003_04_01_default.asp#105121890229998642">Jason</a> but he was somewhat invisible.</p>
