<p><b>Chubby Checker gave birth to aerobics</b><br />

<p>Oh yeah, that's a quote from Chubby Checker's <a href="http://www.chubbychecker.com/letter.html">letter to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>. It's sad and rambling and fairly devoid of meaning other than that ol' Chubby is losing it. In a big way. "Where is my more money and my more fame?"</p>
