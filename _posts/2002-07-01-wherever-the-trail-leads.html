<p>Not surprising to me, at least, investigators are on the trail of another corporate accounting scandal, and this one could be a doozy. If it's not covered up, that is. Because this miscreant is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A5561-2002Jun30.html">Halliburton Company</a> and the company was run by our current Vice President, Dick Cheney, before he moved to DC to pull GWB's strings. Harvey Pitt, who chairs the SEC, says his people will go wherever the evidence leads and that "If anybody violates the law, we go after them." The dozens of former Enron executives who <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_03_03_blog_archive.phtml#10496329">infested the Bush administration</a> were bad enough but will Slick Dick have to follow the precedent of Maryland's favorite son <a href="http://gi.grolier.com/presidents/ea/vp/vpagnew.html">Sprio Agnew</a>? Who's gonna run the government if that happens?</p>
