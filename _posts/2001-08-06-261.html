<p><b>Learn more about yourself</b><br />

<p>Recently, I ran into two sites that helped me understand myself better as a person. One is <a href="http://startrek.about.com/library/weekly/aa080201.htm">Star Trek Personality Test</a>, which is "based on the fundamental personality configurations developed by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator...adapted it to Star Trek." My result was an ENFP (Extrovert, Intuitive, Feeler, Perceiver). In Star Trek language, I share a basic personality configuration with James Kirk and Julian Bashir. I found the following paragraph of analysis very accurate and interesting:</p>
<p>"You're deeply caring, sensitive and gentle, which, combined with your need to solve problems, may make you a little too eager to give others advice. You also process information very quickly, which may make others believe you're not listening to them. Before you share your feelings, you have to have time to process them."</p>
<p>The other test is <a href="http://www.humanforsale.com">HumanForSale.com</a>, which "attempts to place a value on your life using a variety of criteria in 4 basic facets of life (physical,mental,lifestyle,personality)." The ite calculated my worth as $2,244,250.00, which is substantially above average, although it gives no breakdown of the answer. Questions included age, height, weight, gender, profession, income, state of residence, and whether or not one makes charitable donations. Youth, height and income seem to be significant in determining value for men, juding from the list of <a href="http://www.humanforsale.com/top.asp?gender=male">Today's Most Expensive Males</a>, who are generally much more valuable than <a href="http://www.humanforsale.com/top.asp?gender=female">Today's Most Expensive Females</a>.</p>
