<p>"<em>The Starlost</em> is considered by many to be the worst sci-fi television show ever." This is the opening line of a seller's <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=617&amp;amp;item=6319551544&amp;rd=1&amp;ssPageName=WDVW">eBay ad</a> for a pack of the 10 episodes of the series which were turned into five movies. Great salesmenship, eh? I was thinking of the show after reading about <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Movies/08/26/people.runner.ap/index.html">the poll</a> by a British newspaper of top scientists that has Blade Runner as best SF movie of all time. I thought <a href="http://www.snowcrest.net/fox/star.html">Starlost</a> was cheesy, cheaply made, but lots of fun; then again, I haven't seen any of the episodes in more than 20 years. <a href="http://www.scifi.com/">SciFi Channel</a>, rescue me!</p>
<p>Anyway, the Big Guy and I decided to put in a lowball bid and see if we get the DVDs.<br /></p>
