<p>Fox has announced they will air a two part special in two weeks during which OJ Simpson will explain <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=newsOne&amp;storyID=2006-11-15T194636Z_01_N14435424_RTRUKOC_0_US-SIMPSON-1.xml&amp;WTmodLoc=Home-C2-TopNews-newsOne-10">how he would have murdered</a> Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman. <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">If</span> he'd been the actual killer. Rather than had a highly paid team of lawyers who used every trick in the book to obfuscate the truth of what happened (I'm not saying he's guilty, though I think it highly likely, but that we'll never really know because his lawyers made it impossible).</p>
<p>Speaking of books, the reason for this special, or at least the timing of it, is that the next day HarperCollins, Fox's publishing division, will release <span style="font-style:italic;">If I Did It</span>, in which OJ goes into book-length detail his theories about the crime. The TV show has him interviewed by Judith Reagan, the book's publisher.</p>
<p>Another straw in the basket. I won't be watching the show or reading the book and I sure hope none of you will.</p>
