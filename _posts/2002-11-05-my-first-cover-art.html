<p>Recently one of the good people at <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;group=rec.music.artists.springsteen">RMAS</a> was good enough to burn me a copy of an outstanding <a href="http://www.littlesteven.com/">Little Steven &amp; the Disciples of Soul</a> concert--<a href="http://www.rockpalastarchiv.de/l3_e.html#soul">August, 25, 1984 at the Rockpalast</a> in Lorelei, Germany. But no cover art, not like the massive amounts that are out and about for Bruce's shows.</p>
<p>So I made my own using Paint Shop Pro. I started with a very cute photo of Steve <a href="http://www.littlesteven.com/messages.html/showthread.php?s=a22b2dd6d2d0097ecc9fe8c6f947f58b&amp;threadid=367">posted</a> to the Little Steven discussion board. Add a little text, a little poorly copied background color, and an hour or two of playing with the software and <em>voila</em>:</p>
