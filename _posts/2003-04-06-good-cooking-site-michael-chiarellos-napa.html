<p>TS1 and I were watching <a href="http://www.napastyle.com/tv/mcsnapa.jsp">Michael Chiarello's Napa</a> earlier today and he cooked two dishes that were reasonably Atkins-compatible, especially the <a href="http://www.napastyle.com/kitchen/recipes/recipe.jsp?recipe_id=332"><img height="7" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tiny_orange_arrow.gif" width="13" border="0" />Long Cooked Hen with Tomato Sauce</a>. So I brought up his website, <a href="http://www.napastyle.com/tv/mcsnapa/mcsnapa.jsp">Michael Chiarello's Napa</a>, and was very pleasantly surprised to find that he's published all the recipes from his TV shows (with a photo of the finished product) and not just used the site as a teaser for selling his cookbooks. Although the site does sell the cookbooks, signature cookware and food products (NapaStyle is Chiarello's brand), but not in an obnoxious way. Check it out and <em>manga</em>!</p>
