<p>Just watched the 2004 <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame/">American Songwriters Hall of Fame ceremony</a> and I'm thinking&nbsp;specifically of <a href="http://www.jonnylang.com/">Jonny Lang</a> singing Steve Wonder's <em>Living for the City</em>. An excellent instance of a great song remade as blasting rock and roll. Though I have to think that some people were wondering about the length of Lang's blistering guitar solo, much as I enjoyed it. We need more of this and, for example, I'd love to hear <em>What Becomes of the Brokenhearted</em> done this way, after hearing the traditional arrangement on <em>Standing in the Shadows of Motown</em> the other night.</p>
<p>(Why am I not surprised to find that Lang covered the Wonder tune on his last release?)</p>
