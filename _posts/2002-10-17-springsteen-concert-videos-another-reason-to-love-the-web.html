<p>Today was the big live concert that Bruce and MTV chose only to show in Europe. Making up for it, in a way, was my finding via RMAS of <a href="http://www.brucevideos.com/home.shtml">Bruce Springsteen Live Videos</a>. This site posts for your downloading pleasure a few (currently six) concert video clips that were never commercially released. Note that these are not exactly big polished productions but the three I've seen so far are quite watchable. The files are very large, from 30-120 MB for each song, but that does mean better quality too.</p>
<p>I grabbed a solo acoustic <em>Growin' Up</em> from a little 1972 club show, <em>Spirit in the Night</em> recorded at the Hammersmith Odeon, London, in 1975, <em>Candy's Room</em> from the classic 1978 Birthday shows at the Capital Theater, Passaic, NJ, and <em>Waitin' on a Sunny Day</em> recorded at the very same San Jose show the Sweet One and I rocked out at just this past August. When will <em>Reason to Believe</em> be back for the taking?</p>
<p>Don't miss the <a href="http://www.brucevideos.com/clips.html">second page of clips</a>, which aren't really whole songs but decent sized portions that could be gleaned from broadcast documentaries and shows. Including a three minute plus clip of <em>Cover Me</em>!</p>
<p>Go see for yourself or come by the house here for a show. <em>Thanks Pete!</em></p>
