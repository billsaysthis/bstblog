<p>One career (or hobby/addiction) I've never pursued is sports gambling because, simply put, I suck at picking winners. Especially when there's money on the line; I found that out when I was much younger and actually put about $200 where my mouth was on a few wagers. So I'm not at all surprised that in the first round I had <a href="http://www.sportsfilter.com/lockerroom/comments.cfm/384#8056">two winners and two losers</a>. In other words, if you're looking for winners in the NFL playoffs don't go by my picks. Which, after this weekend's amusements, are:</p>
<p><i>Division Round:</i> New England over Tennessee, Indianapolis over Kansas City, Philadelphia over Green Bay, St. Louis over Carolina. Props to John Fox for getting the Panthers this far but (ignoring the really strange season ending loss to Detroit) the Rams have really had game the last couple of months. Farve and the Packers run into a rested, tested Eagles with a lot to prove but if there's any one of these picks I'm wavering on, it's this one. Kansas City is backing, or rather stumbling, into the playoffs with a 3-4 record to end the season and Priest Holmes only plays offense.</p>
<p><i>Conference Round:</i> St. Louis over Philadelphia, New England over Indianapolis. One dome team wins in the cold and on the road, one won't get untracked.</p>
<p><i>Super Bowl:</i> New England over St. Louis. Tom Brady is amazingly underrated as a winner and was even back in the day when he was the Michigan QB.</p>
<p>Remember, though, that I'm not good at this and you use this guidance at your own peril.</p>
