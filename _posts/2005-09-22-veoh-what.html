<p>So I'm looking around on the web this afternoon and come across <a href="http://www.veoh.com/">Veoh Networks</a>. This startup has just announced the public beta of their 'legal' video P2P network and client software. Okay, fine, read the pages, the press releases, yadda yadda yadda (where is the blog?) but one little thing I couldn't find anywhere on the site.</p>
<p>WHAT PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE?</p>
<p>Excuse the screaming. I realize in a P2P network the content is provided by the users but when launching a venture such as Veoh some material has to be seeded. Otherwise why will ordinary users sign up? Score one for the paranoid in me but I have yet to fnd a good enough reason to install any P2P software.</p>
<p>So I'm not the target audience. I might be if there was, say, lots of live EPL and other football available. I just think it's silly to completely slough the programming when it's about the second most obvious question prospects will ask.</p>
