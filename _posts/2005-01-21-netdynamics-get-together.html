<p>A bunch of the old crew met up tonight at Blue Chalk in Palo Alto and three hours passed for me like 20 minutes. I really enjoyed seeing so many people I enjoyed working with for the first time in a long time. Also terrific to find out how well many of them are doing with careers (I was about the only person unemployed), with family and kids.</p>
<p>Peter Yared, who recently founded <a href="http://www.activegrid.com/">ActiveGrid</a>, is the only other person with <a href="http://peteryared.blogspot.com/">a blog</a>. Several other ex-ND folks have founded companies as well: Zack Rinat, Olivia Dillon and Yarden Malka co-founded <a href="http://www.modeln.com">ModelN</a>; <span class="bodySmall"> 									Diana Jovin</span>, Dave Brewster and Todd Greene started CascadeWorks, which they sold to Elance, and Diana and Dave produced a very cute little daughter (they got married before she left Sun); Doron Sherman was very active, co-founding Collaxa and selling it to Oracle and more recently starting <a href="http://www.uappoint.com/">UAppoint</a>; Ofer Ben Shachar founded Noosh (he's still Chairman) and is in the early days of a venture that's taking a very innovative approach to search technology; and, Jim DiSanto is Chairman and CEO at <a href="http://www.konaware.com/index.html">KonaWare</a> (not sure if he was a founder, but he has been in at the start of several other companies). I probably have missed a couple, and there are definitely a couple of projects in the works from others.</p>
<p>But the most part is that I had a fun night out--and someone else paid the tab! Big thanks to Maureen Dubois very organizing the party.<br /></p>
