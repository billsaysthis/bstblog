<p>Did PG&amp;E and it's bankers just <a href="http://www.iddmagazine.com/idd/NYTSStories/nytsstories.cfm?id=8802&amp;issueDate=current">cost California taxpayers another $100 million</a>? That's certainly the position taken by critics of the utility's recent getting out of bankruptcy bond sale say, and the argument sounds reasonable to my ears. Then again, what's another hundred million dollars after all the billions that have been wasted in recent years through the state's so-called energy crisis?</p>
