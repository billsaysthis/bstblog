<p>What I've seen so far of the new shows (using <a href="http://www.tvpicks.net/fallpreviews/2004-05fallgrid-est.html">this list</a> as a reference):<br />

<ul>
<li>LAX: We could only watch about 20 minutes of the first episode before turning it off--will this be Heather Locklear's first series failure?</li>
<li>Father of the Pride: You must be kidding</li>
<li>Veronica Mars: First episode was good, very promising but whether the creative staff can keep up the complexity and lack of teen soap are reasonable questions. Given the lack of time slot competition I expect to watch and see.</li>
<li>Hawaii: Um, I prefer the <a href="http://epguides.com/HawaiiFiveO/">Five-0</a> repeats on the Hallmark Channel</li>
<li>Quintuplets: Andy Richter can't save this mess because--look at the title--he isn't the main character and Fox should have never cancelled his <a href="http://epguides.com/AndyRichterControlstheUniverse/">Controls the Universe.</a></li>
<li>Joey: A guilty pleasure for this <span style="font-style:italic;">Friends</span> fan<br />
</li>
<li>Jack &amp; Bobby: After two episodes, I like the future documentary snippets more than the teen years main acts but for now am willing to give it a chance.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>Returning shows worth a mention:<br />

<ul>
<li>The Wire: Justifies the $10/month for HBO all on its own</li>
<li>Smallville: He flew, he flew! But only sorta. I like Lois Lane but wonder where the producers are going with the Chloe's not dead idea.</li>
<li>Two and a Half Men: Not really new but I did finally check it out the other day for the episode with Elvis Costello and Sean Penn. Despite the star power, I don't get the appeal.</li>
<li>NYPD Blue: Good start for the last season. I can tell already that I will despise the new Lieutenant by the end of the next episode.</li>
<li>Law &amp; Order: The formula is intact although I wonder how the comments on the new detective's wad of cash and fancy Benz will distract.</li>
<li>That '70s Show: Hyde is half black? Amusing twist for an aging show.<br />
 </li>
</ul>
<p> I won't be watching, not including reality shows since I don't watch any of them:<br />

<ul>
<li>Listen Up: Didn't like the guy in high school or <span style="font-style:italic;">Seinfeld</span><br />
 </li>
<li>North Shore: <span style="font-style:italic;">OC</span>-wannabe<br />
 </li>
<li>Second Time Around: Girls rule but not me<br />
 </li>
<li>Rodney</li>
<li>Method &amp; Red: Stupid hip-hop is still stupid<br />
 </li>
<li>The Mountain: Teen soapicide<br />
 </li>
<li>CSI: NY: Melina Kanakarides' nose makes me nervous<br />
 </li>
<li>Savages: A Mel Gibson production, need I say more<br />
 </li>
<li>dr. vegas: uh-oh<br />
 </li>
<li>Medical Investigation: Don't like <span style="font-style:italic;">CSI</span>, why would I watch this imitation<br />
 </li>
<li>Boston Legal: Didn't like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Practice</span>, can't see this being any better<br />
 </li>
</ul>
<p> Yet to be decided:<br />

<ul>
<li>Lost: Time slot competition means this interesting show from the creator of <span style="font-style:italic;">Alias</span> is unlikely to survive long enough to get eyeball time<br />
 </li>
<li>Kevin Hill: Best reviewed new show of the season but...<br />
 </li>
<li>Desperate Housewives: Lots of hotties, might give it a whirl<br />
 </li>
<li>Clubhouse: Dean Cain, thumbs up; baseball, thumbs down.</li>
</ul>
<p> More later, as more shows are watched.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">11/16</span>: <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_11_14_blog_archive.phtml#110065622371533013">Part 2</a><br /></p>
