<p><b>Tonight's movie: Rush Hour 2</b><br />

<p>Chan and Tucker team up again, this time in Hong Kong and Las Vegas, and deliver a bucketfull of belly laughs. <a href="http://www.rushhour2.com/intro.html">Rush Hour 2</a> reuses most of the pieces that worked the first time around but intensified them or transformed them for the new setting or villain. Oh yeah, the villain is (mainly) Zhang Ziyi, the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/PGallery?Zhang,+Ziyi&amp;source=ss">young hottie</a> from <a href="http://www.crouchingtiger.com/">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a>. And <a href="http://photofil.net/story3075.htm">Roselyn Sanchez</a>, one time Miss America Petite, plays good girl (maybe) Secret Service agent Isabella Molina. Alan King has a nothing part as the American baddie and Don Cheadle a good cameo as Tucker's Chinese speaking, kung fu fighting cousin.</p>
