<p>At least after the initial installation. I saw mention of <a href="http://www.cocomment.com/">coComment</a> over <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/02/04/track-your-comments-no-matter-where-you-make-them/">at Scoble's blog</a> but had too tough a time getting one of the posted invite codes to work. This morning, though, one was waiting in my inbox. These Swiss guys are using the same idea as <a href="http://www.rawsugar.com/myaccount/4myWeb">we do with the Topic Navigator</a>, using a bit of JavaScript styled with a CSS block directly after the script call though it's not clear to me that coComment has all the necessary styles exposed in just the right way as you can see on <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/misc/webcomments.php">my new web comments page</a>.</p>
<p>No big deal, because I do like the functionality and it seems to work the way I want more or less. What I would like to see is, even if I show only my comments (the default is to show all comments by registered coComment users on any thread where I comment), a link at the start of my comment to the place on the page where my comment orginates if available. This does happen in the default view. I used to replicate this sort of functionality with the tag 'comments' on delicious but of course I don't really use Yahoo's service any more and I'm happy to have it again.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Elsewhere:</span> <a href="http://benmetcalfe.com/blog/index.php/2006/02/05/cocomment-semantically-forked-conversation">Ben Metcalfe points out</a> a couple of weaknesses in coComment though neither's really applicable to my reason for using it.</p>
