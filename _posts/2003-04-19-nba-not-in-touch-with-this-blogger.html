<p>Halftime of the Spurs-Suns first playoff game and the NBA runs a promo urging viewers to head to <a href="http://www.nba.com">nba.com</a> to buy playoff tickets and get entered into a sweepstakes for tickets to one of the NBA Finals games. Plus front row seats to a Christina Aguilera/Justin Timberlake concert. And I'm thinking, could they come up with a bigger disincentive? Not for me, unless it was the proverbial sharp stick in the eye. Can you say "Bye Bye Bye"?</p>
