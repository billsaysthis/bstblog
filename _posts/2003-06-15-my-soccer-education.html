<p>Just want to give a big thanks to my <a href="http://www.sportsfilter.com/cat.cfm/sports/Soccer.html">SpoFi</a> pals, especially Squealy, SF, Grum, Samsonov, and especially Worldcup2002 for helping me begin to grasp the real football. For example, they turned me on to some good articles on <a href="http://www.eteams.com/soccer/instruction/tips/tip.cfm/946/" title="4-3-3">field</a> <a href="http://www.eteams.com/soccer/instruction/tips/tip.cfm/927/" title="4-4-2">formations</a>. Liverpool's season may be over, ending in serious disappointment due to their last match laydown against Chelsea that gave away the fourth English spot in the Champions League, but their are some interesting national team tournaments over the Summer: Euro2004 qualifiers (where our boy Michael lifted England to victory a few days ago), Confederation Cup (which isn't on English language TV here for some unknown reason but I'll try and watch in Spanish), and next month's Gold Cup (again, US National Team looking for a trophy against tough competition), all leading up to the Women's World Cup here in the US in late September with the American women favorites to repeat.</p>
