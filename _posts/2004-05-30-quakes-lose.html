<p>All streaks end eventually (which Arsenal fans should remember when the EPL restarts) but tonight's 1-0 loss in Columbus was really sad because the game should have been an easy 2-1 or 3-1 win instd of ending a few match unbeaten skein for the Earthquakes. No fault to backup goalkeeper Jon Conway but Jamil Walker was no substitute for Dwayne Derosario up front and the main reason we were shut out.</p>
<p>Walker had chance after chance but was hesitant or unable to fight through the defenders. In fact San Jose had most of the possession all night and held Columbus to a single serious offensive that, but that turned into the only score. Besides Walker's miscues, no one else was particularly strong in the box either with Corrales, Donovan and Mullan launching rockets way over the net. Definitely a lost opportunity.</p>
<p>Derosario and regular GK Pat Onstadt are away for this and the next few games as Canada has some friendlies and a World Cup 2006 qualifying round. It won't get better for us either, as the Quakes will lose Donovan Landon and Richard Mulrooney to US National Team duty. So get ready to see more of Walker, though perhaps coach Dominic Kinnear will go with teenager Arturo Alvarez up front with Brian Ching. Ronnie Ekelund was out again due to neck infection and I can't find anything saying when he's expected but when he does return Donovan can move back to the front. Fortunately we have two weeks until the next MLS match--home against MetroStars on June 12--for some healing and thinking.</p>
<p>On a related note, Fox Sports World <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/headlinenews?id=301686&amp;cc=5901">announced new deals</a> with both the Premiership and FA to broadcast more English soccer in America. Excellent! Or as Dave might say, <em>Bing!</em></p>
