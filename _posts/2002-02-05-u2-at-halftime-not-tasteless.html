<p>Jason over at Q <a href="http://q.queso.com/2002/02/05">gave his opinion</a> that the curtains scrolling the names of the lost during the show was tasteless. I disagree, in fact that's what I was watching when I <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_02_03_blog_archive.phtml#9344293">blogged the comment</a> "I don't usually cry at football games." Some commentators are saying that Americans are already forgetting the emotion and sadness of what happened to us on 9/11 but I disagree. I think that as with any tragedy the mind tries to soften the pain, and Jason being a doctor probably knows this, but this tribute was simple and elegant. I wonder what people like Jason think an appropriate tribute in this forum would have been.</p>
