<p>I've been in Orlando since Saturday. TS1 and I are having a terrific time and head home tomorrow. We generally got to do what we planned including visits to Universal Studios, Epcot and Seaworld plus a couple of days of down time to play with my Rails learning process. We also made a 100 mile drive last Sunday to meet up with my old friend Betsy and her hubby Steve in Vero Beach, which was nice since neither of us had met the other's spouse before.</p>
<p>Though today's rain did cut into our SeaWorld visit, we can go back tomorrow as the tickets are good for unlimited visits during the five days after purchase. That was the one operational difference I saw between the three theme parks as they all charge more or less the same admission and parking, and all have more stores and eateries (by far) than actual attractions. Yesterday was all rain but, being a down day, wasn't a problem.</p>
<p>The Marriot we're at is really nice. We have an oversized one bedroom apartment, essentially, with a full kitchen, living room, jacuzzi for two, bedroom and master bath. No noise from other guests bothered us and (fast enough for me) WiFi included. Which was zero thanks to this being a gift from my folks (thanks, Mom and Dad!) of a week from their timeshare allotment. I never was too impressed with timeshares but after staying here, and a similar Marriot in Palm Desert last January, maybe I was wrong.</p>
<p>I sure had some good 'learning' with RubyOnRails this week. Lesson one: Sessions are your friend. Lesson two: Simple table inheritance may be a good thing but the available documentation and tutorials are far from sufficient to let me get it working. Lesson three: Remember that paths are very different from developing locally on Windows to deploying to a *nix server. Related: Why did Mike and Dave choose Denver in January for the next <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/">Pragmatic Studio</a>?!?!?! I've been in Denver in February and, well, it's no San Diego. But I still want to go.</p>
