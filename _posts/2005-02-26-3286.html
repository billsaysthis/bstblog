<p>I remember this event, 12 years ago today: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0226.html#article">Blast Hits Trade Center, Bomb Suspected; 5 Killed, Thousands Flee Smoke in Towers</a>. I had passed through the World Trade Center 45 minutes or an hour before on my way to the old Home Insurance Company offices on Maiden Lane and afterwards every thing was crazy. Though not close to the chaos after 9/11.</p>
