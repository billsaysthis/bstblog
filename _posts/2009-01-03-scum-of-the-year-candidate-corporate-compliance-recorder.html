<p>We recently incorporated JHTC (now formally Jewish High Tech Community Inc.) and have already received a number of pieces of business junk mail. Actually physical, paper mail. Today, though, we received one that really takes the cake.</p>
<p>And by cake I mean the people who run or work for this company should be forced to listen to a mix tape of Bjork, Barry Manilow and Mongolian throat singing played backwards at earblasting volume. Continuously. For two weeks.</p>
<p>Even the <a href="http://www.labbb.org/BBBWeb/Forms/General/BBBNewsArchivesPageDetail.aspx?News_ID=109&amp;sm=">Better Business Bureau says</a> that the company known as Corporate Compliance Recorder is a scam intended to trick businesses into paying $150 (the price is higher now) by making us think their notice comes from a government agency.</p>
<p>The thing looked hinky to me but never having been the president of a corporation before I was unsure. This is a great thing about the web, if other people have run into similar crap you can usually find them out.</p>
<p>I thought the return envelope they included was postage paid, so I could at least cost them 40 cents or whatever to send them a piece of my mind, but sure enough their was no postage on the envelope, damn it.</p>
<p>2009 is only two days old but these assclowns are already in the running for Scum of the Year.</p>
