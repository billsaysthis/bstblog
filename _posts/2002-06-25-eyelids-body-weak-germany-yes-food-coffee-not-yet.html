<p>Got up at 6:05 to watch Germany - Korea with nothing in the house to eat (well, I'm too lazy to cook the eggs) and then I found the Springsteen news, need to get my ass over to the coffee shop for the morning energy! Germany, showing their trademark precision, was never really in danger and American-killer Michael Ballack gave them the only <a href="http://worldcup.espnsoccernet.com/report?match=48869&amp;lang=en">net they needed</a>. Other than Oliver Kahn--who will have to be tournament MVP if Germany wins--the team showed no passion and since Ballack will be disqualified after geting his second yellow card of the knockout stages, have to be the underdog if Brazil come through. If Turkey pulls off a miracle, all bets are off, I wouldn't even try and pit my scant soccer knowledge against such confusion. So I still see Brazil as the best choice to lift the ugly thing.</p>
