<p>The academic division at BillSaysThis has done further study of traffic condition in the Mountain View/Palo Alto area in <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/columns/ci_10091243">consultation with a local expert</a> and the results obtained are not pretty. Despite spending <span><span>$123 million to rebuild this interchange our researchers have found liitle improvement, particularly just north of the massive project in Palo Alto.</p>
<p>The situation could be worse, see the many problem reports concerning the the Sunol Grade section of 880, but our conclusion is that the new interchange design was poor and did not acount for sufficient factors in surrounding areas. This is, of course, all too common with government spending.</p>
<p>The researchers did have one bright note: The commute in the opposite direction is far worse.<br /></span></span></p>
