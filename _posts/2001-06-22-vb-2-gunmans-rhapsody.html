<p>Robert Parker, best known for the two dozen or so Spenser detective novels (you may remember the <a href="http://members.aol.com/spensersw/">mid '80s TV series</a> starring <a href="http://www.roberturich.com/page4.html">Robert Urich</a> as Spenser and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/8914/index_II_prototype.html">Avery "Captain Sisko" Brooks</a> as the ultimately cool Hawk), takes a poke at retelling the Wyatt Earp/Shootout at the OK Corral western tale in <a href="http://www.bookbrowser.com/Reviews/ParkerRobert/rhapsody.html">this novel</a>.</p>
<p>His writing is as strong as ever and of course he pays attention to the food being eaten but there is little new here. This story has been told over and over in movies, on TV, and in other novels. For a better recent take watch the 1994 Kevin Costner/Dennis Quaid movie <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0111756">Wyatt Earp</a>. If you feel like reading some Parker, get one of the Spenser books like <a href="http://www.logan.lib.ut.us/booklist/adult/awards/edgar-al.html" title="Won the 1977 Edgar Award">Promised Land</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0440200040/qid%3D990750977/sr%3D1-24/ref%3Dsc%5Fb%5F24/002-6171523-9541634">Pale Kings and Princes</a>.</p>
