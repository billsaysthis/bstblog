<p><b>New new thing turns into new youth thing</b><br />

<p>Michael Lewis, who wrote the really cool <a href="http://qa.justpeople.com/contentnew/careeradvice/BookReviews/LiarsPoker.asp">Liars Poker</a> about the trip money masters of the mid-80s and about Netscape/Healtheon/myCFO meister Jim Clark in <a href="http://www.samizdat.com/isyn/newnew.html">The New New Thing</a>, spent the last year meeting teens using the Internet in ways those of us over 35 just wouldn't imagine for his latest book, <a href="http://www.wwnorton.com/catalog/spring01/002037.htm" title="Check out the nice book cover design">The Future Just Happened</a>, and he talks about it to <a href="http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/books/interviews/story.jsp?story=84474">The Independent</a>. Most of us know of Shawn Fanning, who gave us Napster, but how about 15 year olds lawyer Marcus Arnold or stock manipulator <a href="http://www.business2.com/articles/web/0,,15036,FF.html">Jonathon Lebed</a>?</p>
