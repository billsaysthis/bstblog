<p>Brian Ching reclaimed joint lead of the MLS goal scoring list this afternoon with two goals, leading the Earthquakes to their <a href="http://sanjose.earthquakes.mlsnet.com/MLS/news/team_news.jsp?ymd=20040717&amp;content_id=8558&amp;vkey=news_sje&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;team=sje">first league win</a> in what seems like forever. Have to give the team credit for this one, they dominated the Rapids all afternoon until the heat and pace got to the players for the last 15-20 minutes or so.<br />
<br />&nbsp;<br />
<br />Landon and Ching were really on the same page, with Donovan assisting on both of Ching's goals and scoring the third himself. Ronnie Ekelund also showed he's fully recovered from the injury that cost him most of the season till now. Onstadt was never really challenged except for the one goal, which was late and a blast that he never had a chance to stop. And this is a good time to have a full week off.<br /></p>
