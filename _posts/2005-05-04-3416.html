<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4501277.stm">Liverpool 1-0 Chelsea</a>: I don't think I've been so excited about a sports event since the Earthquakes won the 2003 MLS Cup. A disputed goal in the fourth minute and then 90 minutes of nailbiting and hairpulling but the Reds shut down the Blues for the second game in a row. I'm looking forward to reading some day after quotes from Jose Mourinho, the goal was certainly close, but we outplayed them over the 180 minutes.</p>
