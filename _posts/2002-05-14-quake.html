<p>Yes that was a <a href="http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/shake/STORE/X40133364/ciim_display.html">decent-size earthquake tonight</a>, 5.2 on the R scale, centered about 70 kilometers south of here near Gilroy. I spoke to Vivian in SF and she felt it strongly but a friend in Concord didn't notice a thing. No damage, no one hurt here, but it happened while I was in bed watching the Sharks game and the rolling and shaking lasted a few seconds longer than I liked, I can tell you.</p>
