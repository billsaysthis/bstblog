<p>I do believe I pissed off some suprnatural entity, hopefully not the Flying Spaghetti Monster, because I'm having just the most annoying experience getting the Rails book in my grubby chubby hands. First it was an eBay bookseller pulling a fast one--which eBay, to their discredit, seems uninterested in correcting--and now the good ol' Post Office forwarded the Amazon shipment containing my second attempt (and a book for the Sweet One too!) to the San Francisco facility.</p>
<p>At least that's the semi-coherent explanation given by the Mountain View carrier annex supervisor this morning. Neither he, the carrier he said sent the package to SF nor their database can tell me why or offer a solution other than patience and hope for the best. Being in the customer service game myself I don't have sympathy for them though I have learned to skip the screaming, threatening, and/or cursing as useless.</p>
<p>Everyone's dealt with the USPS at one time and we all know that no one there ever takes responsibility in a meaningful way. They have little in the way of resources despite the numerous recent increases in price and with email and UPS/FedEx eating away at the volume that's not going to change. Wish Amazon had been upfront that shipment was with a DHL/USPS joint venture, something not at all conveyed in the phrase "via Airborne Home."</p>
<p>Doesn't change the fact that I'll have missed another weekend for getting elbow-deep in Rails.</p>
