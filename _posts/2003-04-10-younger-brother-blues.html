<p>[These are the lyrics to another blues tune, kind of a slow tempo Stones idea]</p>
<p>Turned 12 in '69, heard Zeppelin and rocked out<br />
<br />Got my t-shirt, tore my jeans<br />
<br />But my brother'd been everywhere 'fore I was<br />
<br />Had to tell me what everything means</p>
<p>[Chorus]<br />
<br />I got the younger brother blues, Five years behind the times<br />
<br />Yeah, those younger brother blues, Makes me jealous of you everyday<br />
<br />Got those younger brother blues, Watching you sex and drug and rock and roll<br />
<br />Gotta get rid of my younger brother blues, Blow these blues all away</p>
<p>Ain't no justice's how it looked to me<br />
<br />So I picked up a Telecaster<br />
<br />Learned how to play some wild chords<br />
<br />My parents screamed, yeah, master disaster</p>
<p>[Chorus]</p>
<p>Made my fingers bleed learnin' "Stairway"<br />
<br />Smokin' out made it so much easier<br />
<br />Got some of my boys together, had a jam<br />
<br />You know the girlies made it all so fine</p>
<p>[Chorus]</p>
<p>[Bridge]<br />
<br />I know he gave me everything he could<br />
<br />I know he taught me everything he could<br />
<br />I wanted to tell him that I understood<br />
<br />I wanted to show him, if only I could.</p>
<p>[Chorus]</p>
<p>Then my brother packed up for college<br />
<br />Left me all alone, to shine, for the very first time<br />
<br />No more older brother's shadow, oh yeah, no<br />
<br />Finally rockin', finally walkin' and it's all mine!</p>
<p>[Chorus]</p>
<p>[Chorus]</p>
