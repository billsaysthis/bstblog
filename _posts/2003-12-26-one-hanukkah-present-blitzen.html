<p>For those of you who've been following my job saga, I have something to tell. While it isn't the great news of a new full-time position, it is a nice short-term gig building a website for a new company (which for reasons other than my own will go unnamed at this time) that will bring in some cash over the next month. I've learned a good deal over the past three years since taking up PHP, CSS and the rest of the TLAs and will be designing a content system that is the next generation of my past work.</p>
<p>Call it <em>Codename: Blitzen</em> since I've started building it on Xmas Day. I doubt the code or design will be of interest to anyone else though I'm writing with as much abstraction as possible. Still, there are certain layout choices I can't seem to abstract away without getting into a templating system and I am not interested in that. Should be interesting. I'm working for intelligent (and generous) people who've no web skills and who therefore won't be micromanaging me. W00t!</p>
<p>I did get some other nice holiday presents--thanks Vivian, Mom and Dad, Evan, LordB and LadyA, Pam, Dewi and Andrew, and Nancy and Jim--but no need to make the rest of you jealous(!). One present I didn't get was to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337741/">Something's Gotta Give</a> because when we got into <a href="http://www.cineluxtheatres.com/showtimes_almaden.html">the tiny auditorium</a> the only two seats together were in the front row, less than five feet from the screen and we didn't feel like breaking our necks looking up for two hours. Oh well, another time.</p>
