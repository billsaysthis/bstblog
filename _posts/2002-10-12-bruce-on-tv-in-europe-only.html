<p>From the <a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/therising/mailing.html">Official Springsteen mailing list</a>:</p>
<p>"FOR EUROPEAN BRUCE FANS - "A Night With Bruce Springsteen"</p>
<p>      MTV NETWORKS EUROPE PRESENTS<br />
<br />            'A NIGHT WITH BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN<br />
<br />            AND THE E STREET BAND'</p>
<p>London, October 7th, 2002: MTV Networks Europe is to present 'A Night With Bruce Springsteen And The E Street Band' - a unique live concert with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band to be aired live across MTV Networks Europe and VH-1 UK on 16 October 2002, it was announced today.</p>
<p>Set to air to over 127 million homes across MTV's ten feeds in Europe and VH1 UK, the unprecedented musical event, 'A Night With Bruce Springsteen And The E Street Band' will comprise a cross-channel 'live to air', commercial-free concert from Palau Sant Jordi, Barcelona, with an exclusive one hour backstage 'Countdown To Bruce Springsteen And The E Street Band' prior to the concert."</p>
<p>What the heck is going on here? Don't we American fanatics deserve to see this show too? There's never been a real backstage show from Bruce on American TV. One can only hope they'll figure it out quickly and broadcast it here too, live or not.</p>
