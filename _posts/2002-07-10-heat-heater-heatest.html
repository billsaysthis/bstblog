<p>When I was a kid, we used to joke about the heat in the Southwest, places like Arizona. We'd say, in an old Jewish man's voice, "It's hot...but it's dry heat," as if that made all the difference. Now garret down in New Mexico, he's suffering from heat and wildfires, though at least they finally <a href="http://dangerous.phpwebhosting.com/dmzimages/rainbarrel.jpg">did get some rain</a>. And my dad missed playing in a club golf tournament last week because it was so hot and humid; he says six out of nearly 100 players showed up because, damn it, they weren't about to miss a day on the <strike>greens</strike>browns. But this week we're getting it here, with record temperatures of 107 in Gilroy (35 miles south of here) and 101 in San Jose (10 miles south of here on Highway 101, oddly enough), though it was a mild 94 here in Mountain View. Today it's supposed to be...warmer. At least I have a pool out back for cooling off. No A/C, but a pool. Thrilling.</p>
