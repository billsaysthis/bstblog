<p>Maybe I just miss seeing Vivian. Or it could be the nasty boy who pissed me off in chat. But I saw one of those idiotic FedEx commercials (you know, where the two drones are amazing each other with the way BarfEx comes to the rescue) and I was wondering who to call to put a hit on the advertising genius resposnsible for that campaign. To make matters worse I saw another moronic CapitalOne commercials (the guy loses his wallet in the jungle and the chimps party). I suppose I oughtn't be too surprised by the general lack of quality in commercials since most of the so-called creative media is not much better. Movie studios are so short of it that they are making any old thing (I just read about another remake of the Lone Ranger today and saw a commercial for the Resident Evil movie). ABC couldn't even come up with a title for a new comedy show so they are naming it for the timeslot (Wednesdays 9:30) and is so filled with confidence that they ordered all of six (6) episodes. John Grisham tried to stretch with The Painted House and Skipping Christmas but threw it in for the money with his latest retread of all his other legal thrillers, The Summons. Browsing through Costco yesterday I saw that James Patterson, who used to write quality thrillers before degenerating into repetition, has now decided that money talks so loudly that he's putting his name on what has to be someone else's work with 2nd Chance (okay, I'm speculating here but this would be typical of big name authors spinning off a series to someone else who has no rep of his own, just look at Tom Clancy). Music, this I can' talk about because I just don't really like anything coming out these days except U2. /End of Rant</p>
