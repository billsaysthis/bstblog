<p>Why does Ted Koppel keep saying the E Street Band is reuniting? That was true two years ago when they did the tour that resulted in Live in New York City but not now. I'm noticing that Bruce is a nervous interview, especially if he has to talk about himself and his life outside of music--he giggles all the time, tries to turn answers into punchlines. As if he somehow doesn't believe he's good enough to warrant an interview on national TV. LMAO!</p>
<p>I wonder if the rehearsal song segments they're showing, at least the older songs, are a preview of what to expect in concert. So far I've noticed at least: Backstreets, Two Hearts, Promised Land. Backstreets Magazine has <a href="http://www.backstreets.com/setlists.html">setlists of the recent rehearsals/shows</a>. He's played  Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street? and For You and I would totally love to hear those!</p>
<p>Wanna bet the E Street is inducted in the next class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? Damn if they don't all look old enough. Except maybe Max, he's got the eternal youth thing going on. Hard to believe he and Roy joined the band 27 years ago.</p>
