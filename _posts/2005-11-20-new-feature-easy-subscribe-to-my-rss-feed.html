<p>I know I should have spent the time on Rails but I felt like doing something a little different. So I added a little bit of coding so that the RSS feed link only shows on pages where it's relevant--the home page, single post pages, and blog archive pages--and put a link labeled <span>subscribe</span> next to it.</p>
<p>There's something a little more elegant to it, I think: clicking the <span>subscribe</span> link opens a block in place with a list of links to subscribe to BillSaysThis in the more popular feedreaders (that is, those that have the capability) using JavaScript. Of course, there's a close the block link at the bottom to restore the pristine page state.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/feed-subscribers-illustration.jpg" alt="screenshot of the block" /></p>
<p>If there's any interest I'll make the HTML, JavaScript and image files available; <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/contact.phtml?sub=Share%20Feed%20Subs%20Code">just ask</a>.</p>
