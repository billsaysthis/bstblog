<p>On the one hand we have a monster like Mike Tyson. On the other, a shy, retiring (but <a href="http://noahgrey.com/archives/archive-012002.shtml#26">less so all the time</a>, more power to him) guy like Noah Grey. Never would they occur together in a single thought except that while surfing this morning to Jim McCormick's <a href="http://www.jimformation.com//archives/00000087.htm">article about Tyson</a> and his absurd rant to a sportswriter I saw a comment posted by Noah. For someone who has barely left his room in years, until quite recently, Noah has empowered thousands of folks to find their own public voices using his <a href="http://noahgrey.com/greysoft/">GreyMatter content management system</a> at no cost.</p>
