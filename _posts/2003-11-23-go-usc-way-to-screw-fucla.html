<p><em>"None of this BCS. . . Sugar Bowl -- none of this matters," said USC wide receiver Mike Williams. "It's about today and how we handled them. God, I hate them."</em></p>
<p>So <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=wojciechowski_gene&amp;id=1668532">said</a> star Trojan wide receiver Mike Williams after yesterday's 47-22 dismantling of their crosstown rivals. Williams had 12 receptions, 181 yards and two touchdown catches; he rested after the halftime whistle. QB Matt Leinart, fellow sophomore and rival for next year's Heisman, had nearly 300 yards passing and tossed those two TD catches to Williams. Combined with Michigan's stomping of Ohio State for the Big 10 championships, USC is assured of a shot against Oklahoma in the national title game as long as they take care of business two weeks from now against Oregon St.</p>
