<p>Yes, this was the fourth viewing. No, we didn't see it on the just released DVD--I'm waiting for the massive 12+ disc deluxe set sometime in 2005. Turns out the movie theater in Milpitas has a special on Tuesdays, only $1 per ticket (with a couple of exceptions). But hey, who could pass up LotR:FotR for $1, especially since it's been six months since I <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_02_17_blog_archive.phtml#9930590">last saw it</a>? At the end was a trailer for <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0167261">The Two Towers</a>, which is a different version from the one showing now before other films, does not have the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Blanchett,+Cate">Galadriel</a> voiceover. Only four months and change until that's out for your holiday viewing pleasure!</p>
