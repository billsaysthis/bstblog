<p>Another <a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/opinion/7502892.htm">absurd column</a> by the <em>Mercury News</em>' voice of the illegal aliens prompted this response from me. Haven't heard from them so I'm guessing it won't get printed. I copied the author but not even a private email from him. Here we go:</p>
<p>Joe Rodriguez, giving his usual support for illegal immigrants, speculates with no basis that "the popular backlash against illegal immigration is less about... cost.. and more about fear..." Unlike Mr. Rodriguez I won't attempt to speak for many but for myself I will say I'm not afraid of these people--American culture has proved itself strong and adaptable all over the world--but I am convinced the problem lies in fundamental fairness.</p>
<p>America, people say over and over, is a nation of laws, its one of our fundamental strengths, yet Rodriguez and others would have us ignore massive lawbreaking for this group of people yet still hold ourselves to legal standards. So what does it say to the rest of the people, the ones legally in this country, that we have eight or ten million criminals all around us yet instead of enforcing the law we should educate, medicate and license them to drive and even give them the vote?</p>
<p>The fact, constantly touted, that many illegal immigrants take jobs that citizens would never do is simply a non-issue. As with any other need, the market would find a way to fill the void. If these people want to come here, let them do so legally and in that case, regardless of their country of origin, I'll give them my full and unqualified support.</p>
<p>So next time Joe, do a little homework with the people before tarring us with the old brush of racism.</p>
