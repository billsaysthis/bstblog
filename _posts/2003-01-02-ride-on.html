<p>New Year's Day - together we mark a new birth<br />
<br />that may well bring much that is good to so many.<br />
<br />Though the cynic in me says life is, ha!, not so easy.<br />
<br />Yesterday we worried what the dropping ball might bring<br />
<br />and sighed with relief that our fears were overblown.<br />
<br />Next week, next month, next moon, tears may yet flow<br />
<br />once again and today's good cheer be forgotten.<br />
<br />But I will not lay back in my chair and take these<br />
<br />pains to heart before they come to life, I will stay my course.<br />
<br />Ride on, though there be cares aside me.<br />
<br />The house, this street, all is quiet on New Year's Day.<br />
<br />I called around to ask family and friends for what words<br />
<br />of wisdom they could share, so much love in their voices,<br />
<br />good cheer, makes me sit up tall and proud and yet...<br />
<br />Yet there are dark clouds inside these wintry skies<br />
<br />That still may bring pain and punishment, tearing,<br />
<br />to me and these voices filled with so much love.<br />
<br />No matter, I ride on to find the good that always will out.</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="http://dangerousmeta.com/posts/02/20030101#a">garret's posting</a> of a Mark Twain <a href="http://www.twainquotes.com/New_Year.html">letter</a> for today. Did this <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_12_30_blog_archive.phtml#8328451">last year too</a>, maybe a new tradition for me.</p>
