<p><b>BillSaysThis linked in Yahoo! Internet Life</b></p>
<p>I noticed that the visit counter was moving pretty quickly the last day so I took a look at the referrer log and saw a bunch of hits from Yahoo! Internet Life's <a href="http://yil.com/daily/forward/index.asp?date=011109">Forward/Joke of the Day</a> for yesterday. The question was the authenticity of some George Carlin jokes floating around and my site was the first one listed as part of the answer. Thanks <a href="mailto:steveknopper@yahoo.com">Steve</a>. Also traffic coming in from <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=tribalism+vs.+globalization">Google</a> and <a href="http://denbeste.nu/">USS Clueless</a>.</p>
