<p>The full list, 14 as of this moment:</p>
<p>Raul Meireles<br />
Steven Gerrard<br />
Joe Cole<br />
Milan Jovanovic<br />
Rodriguez Maxi<br />
Dirk Kuyt<br />
Leiva Lucas<br />
Jay Spearing<br />
Christian Poulsen<br />
Jonjo Shelvey<br />
Albert Acquilani<br />
Charlie Adam<br />
Jordan Henderson<br />
Stewart Downing</p>
<p>Jovanovic, Poulsen, Acquilani and Cole are likely to be sold or loaned, Maxi is on the bubble and if I had to guess if any of those five stay Shelvey or Spearing will be loaned. That brings us down to nine or ten.</p>
<p>Which seems like a lot when you consider that when healthy every one except Spearing/Shelvey will expect to start and the Reds play a 4-4-2, not a 0-10-0.</p>
<p>Even if a player or two will always be missing through injury, suspension or the like but discounting that who are the four starters?</p>
<p>Gerrard still has to be the first name.</p>
<p>Lucas I think earned the defensive midfield spot as the team"s most dependable player last season.</p>
<p>Dirk Kuyt is the most important creator of goals the last few years and my favorite Red, starts on the right.</p>
<p>Downing probably offers the best supply from the left. That's four.</p>
<p>Adams deputizes for Lucas. One intriguing idea floated a week or two back is to play Charlie as a central defender alongside Skrtel; Adams himself said that might be his best position.</p>
<p>Henderson can spell Dirk as he works his way into a starting position, especially if Downing gives consistent width from the left.</p>
<p>Mereilles seems the big loser in the three signings and if a deal can't be made for Acquilani he might have to go instead. </p>
<p>The transfer window has six weeks left. Let's see what Kenny, Comolli and John Henry get up to!</p>
