<p>Robert Scoble recently wrote, in a comment to <a href="https://plus.google.com/+Scobleizer/posts/2T8d8Wg371k">his G+ thread</a> on the news blowing up around PRISM, that President Obama "hasn't exactly been met with love and flowers by the Republicans for the past few years. Shows there still is a difference."</p>
<p>Sadly I have to disagree. The President hasn't gotten love or flowers from the GOP because he isn't a member. If he was elected at the head of the GOP ticket, their response to his proposals would've been very different.</p>
<p>In fact we can look back to public statements by GOP Congressional leaders around 2010, they said that from their party's perspective every single piece of legislation and appointment coming down from the White House should be dead on arrival. In other words the quality of the item being voted on was totally irrelevant.</p>
<p>Efforts like PRISM, and let's remember that the Administration didn't feel it needed any new legislation to authorize this monster, are being criticized by Republicans. But if it wasn't PRISM, if the President had proposed a new MPG standard that treated trucks like cars or sent Secretary of State Kerry to launch a Kissinger-style shuttle diplomacy with the warring parties in Syria, the result would be no different; the GOP Congressmembers and pundits would be out in force telling us how bad this is for America.</p>
<p>Because how can anything proposed by the Democrats be good for America.</p>
