<p>The Reds register an <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/livescore/commentary/LiveCommentary?matchId=169563&amp;cc=5901">amazing turnaround</a> at home today--why oh why couldn't the programming viziers give us one match that doesn't feature Real Madrid or Manchester United on the US feed--needing to outscore Greek side Olympiakos by three goals in the second half to advance in Champions League play and driven by their recently-returned captain Gerrard, my boys <a href="http://www.uefa.com/competitions/UCL/fixturesresults/round=1968/match=1077225/Report=RP.html">do just that</a>. Gerrard himself put in the third goal to ensure we reached the final 16. And once again the underrated Neil Mellor makes himself a factor by scoring three minutes after coming on in the 78th for the apparently still injury-constrained Baros. Next round is a home and home set in late February with the draw to be held a week from Friday, our opposition will be interesting indeed, the possibilities are the non-English group winners (excluding Monaco, which won Liverpool's grou): Bayer Leverkusen (meaning Landon Donovan could be on the field against us), Juventus, Lyon, AC Milan, or Inter Milan.</p>
<p>On the fantasy side of things, I had a pretty poor Matchday 6 but still am on top of the small <a href="http://en.uclfantasy.uefa.com/M/table.mc?id=372">SportsFilter table</a>.</p>
