<p>The Detroit Lions have hired Bobby Williams (fired as head coach at Michigan State just before the end of their season) to replace Maurice Carthon as running backs coach. Carthon went to the Cowboys as offensive coordinator.</p>
<p>Speaking of the 'Boys, Sean Payton has come on board as assistant head coach and running backs coach; he was the Giants' OC but left after Jim Fassel took away his playcalling duties midway through this past season. Parcells may give Payton the playcalling job in Dallas, as the new guy was building quite a rep until the first games went awry.</p>
<p>Dave Campo, Parcell's predecessor, has joined the Cleveland Browns as defensive coordinator. Which was clearly a need the way the team's defense collapsed last weekend against the Steelers. Campo worked with Browns head coach Butch Davis at Dallas and the University at Miami. Foge Fazio, a solid oldtimer, took the fall for inexplicably calling a prevent defense on the last two Steeler drives.</p>
<p>Cincinnati and Jacksonville are still looking for new head coaches (and Jax a GM) but at least the Bengals might be getting close. The reportedly are down to a choice between ex-Jag Tom Coughlin and Redskins DC Marvin Lewis. I hope they go with Lewis, though I hate to wish that job on anyone.</p>
