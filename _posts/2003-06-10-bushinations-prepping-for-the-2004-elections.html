<p>Item 1: President Bush stated flatly on Monday that Iraq had a weapons of mass destruction program and rejected the idea of Washington's credibility being at stake in the search for banned arms.</p>
<p>Item 2: The United States sees a high probability the clandestine al Qaeda network will try to launch a chemical, biological or nuclear attack within two years, the U.S. government said in a report made public on Monday.</p>
<p>My immediate reaction is that this is the beginning of some serious PR work by Karl Rove to combat the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_06_01_blog_archive.phtml#200397483">obvious negatives</a> of what's happening in the Middle East.</p>
<p>To which one fairly intelligent individual said: "Well that is... like... Ah... pinpoint accuracy. I think the next time the Feds wants me to pay my taxes I will tell them that they can expect me to file a return sometime in the next 2 years... maybe... probably... kind'a depends on a lot'ta things... I guess it would be best tho if they just continue as if I wasn't going to pay my taxes at all, otherwise they might be caught flat footed! And one of the problems I have with filing my tax returns is that I might have made money but I'm not sure because the people who keep track of these kind'sa things for me are giving me the wrong information all the time... but I can't tell the auditors who these people are because they have all moved into a new organization where it is forbidden, for safety's sake, to reveal who is doing the books for who."</p>
