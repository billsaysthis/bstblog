<p><span style="font-style:italic;">You:</span> Bill, we know you watched three moves Sunday night and Monday afternoon so where are the revews?</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Me:</span> The answer is in the form of a riddle: Where is LittleSteven?</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">You:</span> Ah, we see. You're saying that your laptop crashed again. What was it this time?</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Me:</span> For the third time in less than 12 months the hard drive went byebye. The BIOS wouldn't even admit the system had one.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">You:</span> So Fry's called lemon on the sucker and you're typing this on a brand new box?</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Me:</span> (After burst of laughter) You must be thinking of Mirror Universe Fry's because the chain I go to hardly gives up so easily. The service managers wouldn't even agree that I had a priority claim on a technician's time to get a diagnosis.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">You:</span> But but but... LittleSteven was in their paws only five weeks ago. How could it have failed again so soon?</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Me:</span> To hear their explanation, the two failures could be entirely unrelated. Seriously! Anyhow, late afternoon I called back to see if the testing had been done. It was, not that anyone bothered to call and let me know despite the promises made. The hard drive is kaput and the test claimed the RAM was bad too but replacing the RAM didn't clear the error so they figured might be the memory slot. Beyond the scope of work Fry's will do at the store service counter so today it was gonna be shipped off to the central depot and possibly on to Toshiba.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Brought to you by a cheapass Compaq loaner...</span></p>
