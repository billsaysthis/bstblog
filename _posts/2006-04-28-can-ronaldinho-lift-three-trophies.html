<p>Barca can <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sow/news?slug=reu-spainpreview&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns">take the league title</a> this weekend, trophy one for the most amazing player out and about today. My money says he'll get number two in a few weeks at the Stade de France when his club take apart Arsenal in the Champions League final. The third may well be in early July when he leads his national side to a second straight World Cup victory. All three will be an awesome haul!</p>
