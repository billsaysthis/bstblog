<p><a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor">Dan Gillmor</a> from your paper often mentions tech-oriented business or political stories that are not being covered reasonably by our larger media organizations, so it isn't unreasonable to ask that your paper be more aggressive than others on important stories, tech-oriented or otherwise. Also, since I'm a daily subscriber and read the MN front to back each morning, I would like to see such coverage even if Gillmor did not write such material.</p>
<p>In this instance I would like to see better coverage of what's happening in D.C. regarding Iraq and how the current Administration handled the situation. President Bush has stated that his critics are revising history with their arguments but from where I sit the truth is just opposite--he and other Republicans are changing their arguments and assertions in regards to Hussein and WMD and Iraq-al Quaeda.</p>
<p>A very current instance would be Sen. Frist's <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/afp/20030626/pl_afp/us_iraq_weapons_politics&amp;cid=1521&amp;ncid=1480">appearance on the Today show</a>.</p>
<p>Today's remarks can be compared to his previous statements, which have been compiled here:</p>
<p><a href="http://billmon.org/archives/000281.html">http://billmon.org/archives/000281.html</a></p>
<p>Bottom line: what would be really useful and interesting to read is the response one of your reporters gets by pointing out this contradiction to the senator. Despite this being a free country/free speech/however one characterizes it, I as a private individual simply do not have access to this man or other important politicians where your organization does, so I'm asking you to do what I can't.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
<br />Bill Lazar</p>
<p>[I did send this to the address specified on the paper's website, very early this morning, but no response at the close of business.]</p>
