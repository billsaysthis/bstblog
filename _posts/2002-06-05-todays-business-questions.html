<p><a href="http://staging.infoworld.com/articles/hn/xml/02/06/04/020604hnbluestone.xml?Template=/storypages/printfriendly.html">HP plans to sell off middleware products</a> but who would want to buy the skanky ass software? The WebGain news was weird but makes a little bit of sense. They paid good money for Bluestone and its app server less than two years ago although lately they have been giving it away with every copy of HP/UX. I wonder if HP would take a bid of $1 (no zeroes) for the app server?</p>
