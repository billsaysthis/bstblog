<p><strong>World Cup '02: Argentina early favorite</strong></p>
<p>According to a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml?type=sportnews&amp;StoryID=465164">Reuters poll of soccer writers</a>, Argentina is a strong early favorite to take a third world crown this Summer in the <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/en/">World Cup finals</a> in South Korea and Japan. Getting 24 out of 40 votes, the South Americans will open in the 'Group of Death' with <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/en/t/t/eng.html">England</a>, Nigeria, and Sweden. England got three votes, while defending champs France were second with seven; the US team got zero zilch nada no votes and will be lucky to get out of the first round after their miserable performance in 1998. With five or more Liverpool men slated to play, though, I give England my vote.</p>
