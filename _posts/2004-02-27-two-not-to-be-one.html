<p>I want you to feel okay<br />
<br />I want you to still have the love in your heart<br />
<br />That you told me was beating there<br />
<br />When we were holding hands back at the start.</p>
<p>Don't listen to the words<br />
<br />Coming from the people and the air<br />
<br />Finding their way to you so fast and free<br />
<br />That hurts even though you know you care.</p>
<p>Love, love, love will come to you<br />
<br />Someday you'll find the man to match<br />
<br />Your eyes will lock onto each other and<br />
<br />You'll spend your lives together</p>
<p>You may feel that right now your feet are<br />
<br />Wandering through dank caverns aimlessly<br />
<br />One foot, two feet, dripping water behind you<br />
<br />Every drop rebounds so hard and fatefully.</p>
<p>We spent days and nights together liquidly<br />
<br />Surrounded by people trying to tear<br />
<br />A hole in the gathering but not alone nor<br />
<br />Only we two were finding some way to share.</p>
<p>You offered your heart freely and I wanted<br />
<br />Badly to agree but it just wasn't within me<br />
<br />I couldn't find the same sentimental pressure<br />
<br />Inside myself and now I must let you be.</p>
