<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=technologyNews&amp;storyID=6876941">Ted Kennedy complains</a> about a <a href="http://www.jfkreloaded.com/">new video game</a> that allows users to play the assassination of his brother John, though only from the historically documented lone gunman sequence and not the tinfoil hat conspiracy scenarios. I wouldn't want to play this, I don't care for any bloody, violent games, but I do wonder how this is any worse or better than games which recreate other historical events like both World Wars, Korea and Vietnam.</p>
