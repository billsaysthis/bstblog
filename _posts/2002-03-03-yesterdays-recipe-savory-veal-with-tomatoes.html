<p>I can't say that the name of this dish is really that useful but the best we could do on short notice. I was motivated here by seeing the incredible selection of meats at Ditmars Wurst Haus on San Antonio Road the other day when I stopped in for a pastrami sandwich.</p>
<p><em>Ingredients</em>
<ul>
<li>3/4 lb. ground veal<br />
</li>
<li>3/4 lb. ground pork<br />
</li>
<li>1 bunch baby broccoli<br />
</li>
<li>8 oz oyster mushrooms<br />
</li>
<li>24 oz crushed tomatoes<br />
</li>
<li>8 oz tomato paste<br />
</li>
<li>1 large onion, halved, then the halves quartered and separated into large flat pieces<br />
</li>
<li>5 cloves of garlic crushed and diced<br />
</li>
<li>1 bunch of fresh oregano<br />
</li>
<li>1 bunch of fresh cilantro<br />
</li>
<li>1 bunch of fresh basil<br />
</li>
<li>olive oil, salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Preparation</em>
<ul>
<li>Mix ground meats together in a bowl with salt and pepper<br />
</li>
<li>Heat a skillet with oil, brown the meat, set meat aside<br />
</li>
<li>Sweat garlic and onion until onion is translucent<br />
</li>
<li>Add tomatoes, then tomato paste<br />
</li>
<li>Add baby broccoli, a little salt and pepper<br />
</li>
<li>Add 3/4 of each the basil, oregano, and cilantro, chopped roughly, stir well and simmer five minutes<br />
</li>
<li>Add meat, stir to coat thoroughly, simmer a couple of minutes<br />
</li>
<li>Add mushrooms, simmer three minutes<br />
</li>
<li>Remove from heat and stir in remaining herbs</li>
</ul>
<p>Serving suggestion: spoon on top of some thick fresh bread and top with grated parmaggiano cheese.<br /></p>
