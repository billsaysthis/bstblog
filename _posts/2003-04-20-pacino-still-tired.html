<p>Spurred, I suppose, by the release next Friday of his new film, <a href="http://joblo.com/upcomingmovies/2003/peopleiknow.htm">People I Know</a>, the Times' film critic A.O. Scott takes a look back at Al Pacino's career: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/20/movies/20SCOT.html">Seen This Guy Lately?</a> Scott's assessment, of a sameness in the characters Pacino has portrayed over the past decade or more, seems spot on to me and apparently his role in this new film is no different. He plays a publicist this time out and, not having seen either movie, I wonder if Pacino's Eli could be <a href="http://www.phoneboothmovie.com/">Colin Farrell's Stu</a> 40 years down the road. Pacino, though, is pretty much always worth watching even when the movie around him (<a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_08_25_blog_archive.phtml#85401757">S1m0ne</a>, anyone?) is mostly crap.</p>
