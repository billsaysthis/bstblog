<p>Her eyes showed a light of extraordinary spark<br />
<br />Revisioned events of tumultuous times<br />
<br />Passionate men moving below her level<br />
<br />Their colors tumbling together but not merging<br />
<br />Not willing to visit a possibility of common<br />
<br />Cause nor mediated interest nor simple love<br />
<br />But in her eyes the flagrant flambouyant messages<br />
<br />Had little to say and even less to impress<br />
<br />No she would not take up the flag or join<br />
<br />Her vision was far away engrossed in love.<br /></p>
