<p>You too can <a href="http://www.senate.gov/~hollings/webform.html">express your opposition</a> to the ridiculous and unconstitutional Security Systems Standards and Certification Act, as I did:</p>
<p>Sen. Hollings,</p>
<p>After the firestorm of opposition that emerged when you previously attempted to introduce the Security Systems Standards and Certification Act, I am amazed to read that you are trying to bring this blight on the constitution back to life.</p>
<p>Honestly, how happy are you to be nicknamed the Senator from Disney? And this is one of the nicer things I have read recently about you.</p>
<p>Please reconsider the impact of your proposed legislation on the consumers of this country. Are you really so concerned about the big media companies that you would outlaw Linux and other similar good things?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and consideration,<br />
<br />Bill Lazar</p>
<p>I <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_09_30_blog_archive.phtml#6135517">also wrote</a> on this abomination of a legislation back in October.</p>
