<p>To quote my <a href="http://www.gen-x-design.com/archives/aptana-launches-cloud-jaxer-and-studio-12/">smooth-talking co-worker Ian</a>: "We've been hard at work on a big-ass milestone for Aptana: Three products launched... most notably our cloud initiative." Personally I managed to publish the new <a href="http://www.aptana.com/jaxer/guide">Jaxer Guide</a>, tweak the <a href="http://www.aptana.com/docs/index.php">Studio and PHP documentation</a>, redesign the <a href="http://support.aptana.com/">Support Center</a>, put in place new support processes plus front-end incoming customer success issues.</p>
<p>Here's a quick run-down of each product:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aptana Cloud</strong> - Aptana Cloud is the ultimate in ease and efficiency - a suite of online services integrated right into Aptana Studio 1.2 that puts the power of cloud computing to work for you. Streamline your deployment and development processes at costs far less than doing it yourself.<br /><a href="http://www.aptana.com/cloud?video" target="_blank">Learn More</a> </li>
<li><strong>Aptana Jaxer 1.0</strong> - We're pleased to announce that Jaxer 1.0 is official! Jaxer is the world's first Ajax server, and an emerging server-side JavaScript solution built on the Mozilla Firefox 3 engine. Best of all, weâ€™ve also included it as a free option in our cloud offering.<br /><a href="http://www.aptana.com/jaxer?video" target="_blank">Learn More</a> </li>
<li><strong>Aptana Studio 1.2</strong> - Aptana Studio offers unprecedented support for Ajax combined with today's popular Web platforms. Download Studio yourself or plug it into Eclipse to see for yourself. We've also added great new support for PHP, Ruby on Rails, and Jaxer.<br /><a href="http://www.aptana.com/studio?video" target="_blank">Learn More</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>I'm really enjoying the work at Aptana, Paul and Uri have set up the work environment and culture so that BS is at a minimum with people knowing they have freedom to execute as they see best as long as the results come.</p>
<p>We have a number of engineering-oriented openings; unlike some companies we aren't cutting back. If you want to join a company creating innovative products and services take a look at our <a href="http://www.aptana.com/careers">career page</a> to see if you fit our needs.</p>
