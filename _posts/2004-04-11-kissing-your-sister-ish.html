<p>Quakes did better than <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_03_28_blog_archive.phtml#108103096466211107">last week</a> although 0-0 leaves a taste like ashes in my mouth. ESPN missed the first half hour showing a women's tennis match that ran long and then Landon just could not get past the defense--two of the times he did a Chicago defender pulled him down anyway without drawing a foul call of any sort from the joke of a referee. Next in the sequence would seem to be a win, one can hope it will play out that way next Saturday against the Revolution.</p>
