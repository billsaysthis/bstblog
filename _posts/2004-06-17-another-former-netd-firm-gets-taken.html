<p><a href="http://www.collaxa.com/home.index.jsp">Collaxa</a>, co-founded by NetDynamics co-founder Doron Sherman, is <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/16/oracle_buys_collaxa/">being acquired by Oracle</a> according to the Register. Neither company is commenting but the article says the announcement will come the week after next at JavaOne. This is very cool because Collaxa's product is very meaty but as far as I've heard they were having typical innovative tiny company difficulty breaking through in the marketplace; as part of Oracle that barrier is instantly hurdled. Good on ya!</p>
