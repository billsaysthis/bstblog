<p>When does a price become ridiculous? $2.30 or more for a gallon of gas? Guess not. $30 fee for depositing a check that bounces? Closer. $10 for a movie ticket? Bzzt, there you go. AMC, one of the bigger chains nationwide and owners of the nearest theater I go to these days, just raised their admission to double digits. That's gonna cut down on my visits.</p>
