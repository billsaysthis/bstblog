<p>I'm hearing too many Americans who support the war effort calling anti-war protestors unpatriotic. Which makes me think back to Vietnam and its protests--how in the aftermath almost everyone realized that dissent and disagreement are an important part of what makes our country different. That the insults, invective, and hard feelings hurled back and forth were wrong. So why is it happening over again?</p>
<p>At least we seem to have learned the lesson that our troops are not a target for hatred and insults.</p>
