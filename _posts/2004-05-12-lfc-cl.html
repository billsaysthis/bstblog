<p>Liverpool backed into Champions League qualification today when <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=151035&amp;cc=5901">Southampton drew Newcastle</a> 3-3; with only one game left, 'Toon can no longer catch the Reds on points and Aston Villa at best can match points but loses on goal difference. This was, I imagine, one of the worst seasons in English football history with fourth place Pool nearer the bottom of the table than the top.</p>
<p>And on the business side of the wall, the prime minister of Thailand is battling a homegrown Liverpudlian billionaire real estate developer for the right to buy a large but not controlling interest in the FC. The investment infusion plus the CL cash might at least mean some serious transfer spending in the close season, we'll have to watch and see.</p>
