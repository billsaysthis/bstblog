<p>I had hoped to post the following comment to the MeFi thread but the server developed <span style="font-style:italic;">an issue </span>and blocked me:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/36234#749697">xmutex</a>, patriotic Americans are cheering the US Men on against Panama in <a href="http://www.ussoccer.com/" title="Very nice popup Match Tracker link on this page">tonight's 2006 World Cup qualifier</a>. A goal from my boy Landon has them up 1-0 at the half and a win today means the US clinches a spot to move forward to the next round.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">More:</span> 10 minutes into the second half Donovan takes a beautiful through ball from Zavagnin, jukes the keeper and dives to push the ball off his knee through two defenders into the back of the net. Wearing the captain's armband for the second straight game, <a href="http://sanjose.earthquakes.mlsnet.com/MLS/players/bio.jsp?team=sje&amp;player=donovan_l&amp;playerId=don474618">Number 21</a> is taking his game to a whole new level.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Last:</span> Beautiful second half for the Americans. Eddie Johnson, a 20 year old Dallas Burn forward playing in only his second national team game, came on in the 64th minute and proceeded to put three balls in the net (70th, 84th and 87th minutes); the first two came on passes from Carlos Bocanegro while the third was begun by a corner from Landon. Johnson scored at the end of last Saturday's game giving him four, wow! The third was a true team effort, with three other players taking touches in the goal box. We got a sixth goal just before the end of regulation time, initially announced as an own goal against Panama though it might have been off the head or chest of Brian McBride from a free kick taken by, who else, Donovan.</p>
<p>So that clinches the qualifying group for the US. Last game of the round is Nov. 17 against Jamaica in Columbus. Next year we'll be part of a final round of six teams with the three top going on to Germany 2006. The commentators were saying to expect Coach Bruce Arena to deploy an experimental, younger side next month, to give these players a look and a chance to shine. Maybe Johnson and Brian Ching starting up front with Landon roaming behind?</p>
<p>Interesting matchup on Saturday will be Landon's Earthquakes against Johnson's Burn in Dallas. If the Quakes win or the teams tie, the Quakes go on to the playoffs; if the Burn win, the Quakes stay home. Uh oh.<br /></p>
