<p>At 9:24 a.m. Well, since I'm waiting here from 9-12 for the plumber anyway... The problem I'm having is that, only on premium movie channels (HBO&lt; Showtime, Starz), I frequently (but not always and not predictably) have signal problems where the picture pixilates, fades to black, freezes, displays various green splotches and loses the sound as well. Previously the support rep said to power cycle the Tivo box while this is happening. Tried that Friday night when Jeremiah was on and it did not help.</p>
<p><em>Update 9:46 a.m.:</em> Finally off the generic jazz muzak and alking to a real person but he puts me back on hold to read up on the previous case entries. Still no sign of the plumber. Turned on the TV and the problem was not happening, checked several of the channels. But it did happen last night as soon as I tuned into The Sopranos.</p>
<p><em>Update 9:54 a.m.:</em> Well, off the phone with a couple of suggestions but no solution. "Maybe it's the cable box." is the current position. We'll see. I was told to power cycle the cable box and if that does not help, try switching the two cable boxes. Swell. I suppose I am the first person to EVER call in with this problem. Right?</p>
