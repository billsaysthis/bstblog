<p>Just finished watching this afternoon's big match at Anfield on the Tivo--had to take TS1 for a nice Valentine's dinner-- and though the final score was a positive <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4703844.stm">Liverpool 1-0 Arsenal</a> I have to wonder where the hell Arsenal was. Thierry Henry had one shot, in the 53rd minute, and that was really the only serious save Jerzy Dudek had to make in the 90. This is a team that went the whole season undefeated two years ago, finished second in the league last year and began the night just seven points behind Liverpool in fifth place.</p>
<p>The Reds completely dominated the Gunners though were unable to put the finish until three minutes from time when Luis Garcia, a late substitute in his first appearance back from injury, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/photo_galleries/4714224.stm">cracked the rebound</a> of a Didi Hamann shot off Jens Lehmann's fingers. For my money Lehmann was about the only player who was worthy of the team jersey, with maybe Freddie Ljungberg just behind. The rest of the team played like the teenagers they mostly are and Arsene Wenger is going to have to kick some butt to get back into a top four/Champions League slot. Right now it doesn't seem that likely.</p>
<p>Saturday is another big game for LFC as they host Manchester United in the FA Cup round of 16, followed by a trip to Portugal to meet Benfica in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16. Even though Chelsea are running away with the EPL, there is very definitely still the possibility of silverware for our boys this year!</p>
