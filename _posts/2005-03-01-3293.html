<p>SCOTUSblog has a preview on <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/2005/02/tomorrows_argum_1.html">tomorrow's argument in Deck v. Missouri</a> before the Supreme Court. The case presents an interesting question: Decker was convicted of murder and during the sentencing hearings he was required to wear legirons and was handcuffed to a belly chain and now contends that these restraints predjudiced the jury against him so that they gave him the death penalty. Another one of those where does the line get drawn situations, though generally speaking I don't think that death is a useful sentence.</p>
