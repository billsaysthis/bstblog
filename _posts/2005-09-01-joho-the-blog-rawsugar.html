<p>David Weinberger, co-author of the seminal ClueTrain Manifesto, spoke with our CEO today and had <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/004402.html">some very nice words</a> to say in his blog afterwords: "<em>You can think of RawSugar as a searchable del.icio.us with automagic, hierarchical clustering.</em>"</p>
<p>TechCrunch also <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/?p=183">wrote good things</a> about us after a quick exploration of RawSugar a few days ago.</p>
<p>Can't get enough of these good mentions. Scoble was first, really, but now the ball's rolling!</p>
