<p>Really, really wish the doctors wouldn't take so long to get some answer on what's making me so tired. TS1 and I went to the gym this morning and I had a nice coffee walk with the Big Guy but that drained almost all my energy and I spent the rest of the day wishing I could fall asleep. Annoying or what?</p>
<p>For example, I could barely keep my eyes open watching the US women take on and beat the German side in the Olympics quarterfinals. Knowing when the winning goal would occur (thanks for the tape delay, NBC), I forced myself to keep watching and feel asleep less than a minute later only to be woken up five minutes later(!!!) by a phone call. Almost fell asleep again 25 minutes ago but remembered I have some ribs parboiling on the stovetop. Not what, for sure.<br /></p>
