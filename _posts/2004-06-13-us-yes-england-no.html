<p>Unbelievable! England is leading 1-0 going into injury time when Emile Heskey commits a foul on the edge of the box, then David James brings down Zinedane Zidane in the box and Zidane converts both into goals to give France a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/euro_2004/3787365.stm">2-1 win</a> in their Euro2004 opener. Once again, one has to wonder why Erickson brought on Heskey even as a sub late.</p>
<p>The US, on the other hand, really had no trouble taking a 3-0 victory over Grenada in the first leg of a home and home World Cup 2006 qualifier. Of course, Grenada's total national population is barely greater than the city of Mountain View (where I live) and the only surprise was that the score wasn't 3-0 at the half. Jovan Kirovsky, man, even as a sub I don't like him. Landon: Brilliant!</p>
