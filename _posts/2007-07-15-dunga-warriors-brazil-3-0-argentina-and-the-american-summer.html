<p>The Samba Boys were a 90 minute steamroller today and gave Dunga the trophy in his first competition as coach. Argentina were picked by nearly all the experts (and <a href="http://www.sportsfilter.com/lockerroom/comments.cfm/1513">my SportsFilter cohort</a>) after dominating every match played in Venezuela but just couldn't keep up with their traditional rivals, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=221083&amp;cc=5901">losing 3-0</a>. Robinho and Julio Baptista, two Brazilians that haven't impressed me in club play with Real Madrid and Arsenal, were major factors over the course of the tournament and warrant re-evaluation over the coming season.</p>
<p>Copa America was a disappointment to most American fans but I have to say that both Brazil and Argentina made for enjoyable watching. The young USA team Bob Bradley brought were no match for any of their opponents and Kasey Keller didn't seem to be the veteran leadership promised; given Mexico's third place finish our first choice squad probably have done better than one draw from three matches.</p>
<p>None of the youngsters who joined the squad for this tourney (that is, excluding Bennie Feilhaber and Ricardo Clark) were terribly impressive or showed the quality justifying a regular place as the 2010 Qualifiers get started. Also on right now is the U-20 World Cup and while the US got dumped by supposedly weaker Austria, Freddie Adu, Jozy Altidore and Michael Bradley showed themselves ready for regular inclusion on the senior side.</p>
<p>In deal news, Damarcus Beasley has moved to Rangers in Scotland and talk has Adu joining Old Firm rivals Celtic, Eddie Johnson wanted by multiple Premiership clubs and Altidore a hot property after he turns 18 in the near future.</p>
<p>Overall not a bad summer tournament season for us: the Gold Cup championship (and the 2009 Confederations Cup slot that goes with it), a run out for some candidates at the Copa America and reaching the quarters in the U-20 World Cup.</p>
