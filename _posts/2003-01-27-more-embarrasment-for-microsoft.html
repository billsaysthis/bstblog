<p>I'm not a hard core MS basher, for sure, but the huge Slammer worm that ran around this weekend (and will possibly reach new levels of disruption tomorrow), which takes advantage of a known SQL Server security hole, is not the only problem facing the Redmond giant this weekend. There must be a problem with their in-house mail servers as well because I've gotten over a <i>dozen</i> notification emails for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-061.asp?frame=true">Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-061</a>. Which is trying to tell subscribers to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/notify.asp">Microsoft Product Security Notification Service</a> where to get the (long available) patch for the SQL Server problem. Annoying and laughable, too bad.</p>
