<p>Just spent a couple of hours coding up a <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/contact.phtml?sub=Weblog post">contact form</a> to replace the more or less direct email addresses on this website. Too many robots crawling the web looking for addresses to add to their "unsolicited commercial email" lists for my taste and no matter what address I put up, one or another found them in a matter of days. So it's a little less convenient for some of you, if you don't have my email in your address book, but one use of the form will get that for you. Good thing I have the ability to create unlimited email addresses on my server and block the ones that get too much spam.</p>
