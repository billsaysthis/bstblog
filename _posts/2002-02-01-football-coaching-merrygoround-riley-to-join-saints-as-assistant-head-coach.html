<p>Another example of <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_01_06_blog_archive.phtml#8619139">this mystery</a> pops up with the report that Mike Riley will <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2002/0131/1320618.html">join the Saints</a> as assistant head coach and secondary coach. Longtime Saints assistant Rick Venturi moves up to defensive coordinator from the positions Riley is taking. I just don't understand how Riley can work for Venturi but also be his boss.</p>
<p>Other coordinator news: Bruce Coslet comes back into the league, as rumored, with the Cowboys' offense. Coslet is a West Coast guy so how Emmitt Smith will respond is an interesting question but he knows that Coslet gets results. Kurt Schottenheimer turned down an opportunity to join brother Marty in San Diego and instead took the Lions' DC slot. I believe this is the first major job for Kurt independent of Marty.</p>
