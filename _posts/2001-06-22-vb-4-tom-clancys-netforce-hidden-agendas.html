<p>Second book in the series written by the still uncredited Steve Perry. Interesting but if I didn't already have one other book in this series I wouldn't bother. <a href="http://www.modus-operandi.co.uk/misc/tclancy/netforce.htm">Storyline</a> is fairly similar to the first NetForce novel, only this time the villain is a too smart for himself political hack, chief of staff to a U.S. Senator with more money than brains. Besides the uninspired plot, Perry tries too hard to show how different the world will be in 2010.</p>
