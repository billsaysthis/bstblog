<p>Have you been watching this series on FX? I can't quite make up my mind whether it's good or not, but I think the appeal is sort of like hanging around an accident to see the bloody mess. Seriously, the show pushes the envelope further than any non-premium cable television show and sometimes I think the whole thing is an excuse to show as much fascinating gore and near nakedness and sex. But with a plot thrown in and a bit of characterization. Which is the reason (I think) I keep watching.</p>
