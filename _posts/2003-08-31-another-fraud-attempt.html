<p>Got an odd email to one of my Hotmail accounts just now. The sender (The Adobe Store, store@adobe.com) claimed "We received your request for password assistance." But, first, I don't have an account at the Adobe Store and second, obviously it follows that I didn't look to change my password there. Instead of clicking on any of the email's links, I typed in the one which I was informed would let me modify my account but when I hit Enter, I got this response:</p>
<p>"We're sorry! Service is unavailable because of technical difficulties. We are working to correct the problem and appreciate your patience."</p>
<p>I know, you're thinking the same as me. Someone's hijacked a DNS server and taken over some part of Adobe's online store, then sent spam to lots of people in hopes that some would be naive or stupid enough to click through and fill in whatever form is provided to 'confirm' the account changes. Or more precisely, provide these criminals with personal data that will then be used to deprive said naive or stupid individuals of cash.</p>
<p>But not me, and I hope not you. What I do hope is that these criminals are caught and prosecuted, and suffer serious injury during a lengthy stretch in prison.<br /></p>
