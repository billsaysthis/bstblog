<p>My next rant is: Why are they cutting nearly every song off in the middle? People are watching to see the performances--everything is to put up with in decreasing order of acceptance, celebrity interviews, political speeches, VJ blather, PSAs and commercials. Whacking the primary attractions in half is just fucked up. But why should we expect anything better from MTV? They gave up any connection to their original purpose years ago. If I had my PC set up properly I'd just flip over to the full concerts streaming elsewhere.</p>
