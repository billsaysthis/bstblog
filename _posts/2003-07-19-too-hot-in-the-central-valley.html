<p>Apparently, at least <a href="http://www.crabapples.net/rob/archive/2003_07_13_default.htm#105857130929566981">for Rob</a>. So Rob, pack the wife and kids in the car and drive on up, we can BBQ and hang at the pool! Next Sunday (the 27th) I'm having a couple of of <a href="http://www.sportsfilter.com">SpoFites</a> and family over to watch the afternoon Champions World match up on FSW, so the grill will be getting lit anway. Not that I'm not sitting here sweating and about to head out to the pool for a cool off myself.</p>
