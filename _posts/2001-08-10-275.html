<p><b>Yesterday's book: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</b><br />

<p>Stayed up half the night to finish the fourth <a href="http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/books/goblet/index.htm">Harry Potter novel</a>. Longish but good pacing. Still surprised that I'm enjoying this "children's series" so much but it is true. Harry's <a href="http://www.quidditch.com">quidditch</a> playing was getting a bit old so instead she starts off with the Quidditch World Cup with HP as a spectator and Harry's competition this time around is a test of wizarding skill against (older) students from two foreign wizard schools. You Know Who's still the baddie behind everything but I have to hand it to Rowling, she's really got this going good. And there's even an <a href="http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/">HP weblog</a>.</p>
