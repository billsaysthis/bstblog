<p>This movie was, um, totally fetch! Oh my god, do not even go there! See, it's all about this new girl and these bitches and how the new girl thinks she's going to teach the bitches a lesson but then she, well, she falls off the wagon and--oh my god--becomes the queen bitch herself. But she totally comes to her senses, learns her lesson, and remembers that being good feels good. We sure do get to laugh watching, girlfriend!</p>
<p>We went to see <a href="http://www.meangirlsmovie.com/indexflash.html">Mean Girls</a> because it was written by <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/bios/Tina_Fey.html">Tina Fey</a> from <a href="http://www.saturday-night-live.com/">Saturday Night Live</a>. Not at all because the film features <a href="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0361467/Ss/0361467/C101-26A.jpg?path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Lohan,%20Lindsay">four</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0302640/Ss/0302640/11_CT-1622.jpg?path=pgallery&amp;path_key=McAdams,%20Rachel">teenage</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/granitz/1959/LaceyChabe_Ausse_1079895_400.jpg?path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Chabert,%20Lacey">hotties</a> in the lead roles. Nah, that had nothing to do with our decision, and I'll sue you if you say otherwise! Director Mark Waters also featured Lindsay Lohan in last year's <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_08_10_blog_archive.phtml#106109596817269077">Freaky Friday</a> but I was less impressed with his influence in this movie, the transition and pacing, not to mention the visuals, weren't nearly as interesting.</p>
<p>The movie is an adaptation of Rosalind Wiseman's <em>Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends &amp; Other Realities of Adolesence</em>, which was apparently not the easiest job since the book is non-fiction and without story. As one reviewer <a href="http://www.book.nu/1400047927">wrote</a> (about the book, not the movie): "This reads like a chess manual for social interactions (or more accurately dysfunctional interactions) of teenage females with their peers. The goal of this book is to give parents insight into why certain situations occur and how to help their daughters address them." So props to Mrs. Fey (yeah, guys, she's married) on her initial produced screenplay for giving us an actual story with interesting characters.</p>
