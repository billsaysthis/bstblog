<ul>
<li>Looking at the more expansive <a href="http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2004/11/04/2004countymap3.gif">county level voting maps</a>, all the talk of Red and Blue states is wrong: the division is very starkly <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/04/nyregion/04york.html?ex=1257224400&amp;en=4320fe069a36fa08&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">big city Blues</a> versus everything else Reds.</li>
<li>The way his supporters seem (to me) to idealize Bush is strangely amusing and scary. All the talk about values and morality being the key to his victory strike me as hypocritical, which is nothing unusual even if the pundits are surprised.</li>
<li>Lou Dobbs made a very cogent point on TV yesterday. He said there is no such thing as a political mandate, that the phrase was made up by Bill Clinton, and what Bush has is a legislative majority that will enable him to put most of his agenda through Congress. I think <a href="http://www.midwestacademy.com/Economics/Main3/tsld035.htm">Grover Nordquist</a> must be having wide-awake wet dreams the last 24 hours.</li>
<li>Bush will need an awfully powerful magic wand to fund the <a href="http://www.knoxstudio.com/shns/story.cfm?pk=WALLETWATCH-BUSH-11-04-04&amp;cat=AN">financial aspects</a> (Social Security privatization, making permanent the recent tax cuts, eliminating the stub of an inheritance tax still on the books) of his second term agenda.</li>
</ul>
