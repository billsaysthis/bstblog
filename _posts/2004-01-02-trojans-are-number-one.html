<p>No matter what the BCS computers or regulations say, USC's complete domination of Michigan in the Rose Bowl today showed that the voters were right when they chose the Trojans in the top spot for the final pre-Bowl polls. Three touchdown passes from Matt Leinart (24 of 34 for 331 yards and zero interceptions) to Kerry Colbert and Lendale White and a pass from stud receiver Mike Williams back to Leinart, <strong>nine(!)</strong> sacks and an interception by the SC defense. If the coaches voting the ESPN/USA Today poll had any balls they'd cross out the 2 at the top of their ballot and put a 1 in big black marker, then write USC next to it.</p>
