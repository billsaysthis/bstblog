<p><b>Emmys update</b><br />

<p>The Academy has now posted a text page with all the <a href="http://www.emmys.com/awards/2001noms.htm">Primetime EMMY Nominations</a> listed and so we can see where the rest of the Sopranos's 22 nods came in. The show got four of the five drama writing and three of the five drama directing nominations plus Annabella Sciorra for drama guest actress and noms in casting, costume, editing (two), sound mixing, art direction, and makeup in addition to those mentioned here <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/2001_07_08_blog_archive.phtml#4505557">Thursday</a>.</p>
<p>The Springsteen nominations were for outstanding variety, musical or comedy special; directing for a variety or music program; editing for a miniseries, novel or a special; lighting directing for a variety, musical or comedy program; sound mixing for a variety or music series or special; and, technical direction, camerawork, video for a miniseries, movie or a special. Bruce himself is nominated as a producer with the outstanding variety, musical or comedy special nod.</p>
<p>Star Trek: Voyager capped its last season with eight nominations but none for acting, writing, or directing: costume, makeup, music composition (two), sound editing, and special visual effects (also two).</p>
