<p>Can someone explain the NRA to me? I mean <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/02/opinion/02SAT1.html">seriously</a>. Why are they so insistent on opposing any new legislation and eliminating all existing legislation related to guns? A reasonable set of laws can be put in place so that gun sellers are watched to ensure guns are only sold to, say, people without felony convictions, that gun buyers are registered, and guns themselves equipped with protective and tracking/signature devices so when used in a crime could be identified. This would not prevent Americans from having their hunting rifles and handguns for personal protection and might eliminate a lot of danger to all of us. What a silly dream, eh?</p>
