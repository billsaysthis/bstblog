<p>Well, here I am 24 hours after starting the Leopard update to Miami Steve and it has been without doubt a difficult and annoying 24 hours. Apparently, according to the AppleCare product specialist who helped me, my MacBook had a kernel panic and this required a second installation attempt; fortunately the option to save my user data worked and there was no need to do a full-bore erase the hard drive update on a third attempt.</p>
<p>About that support call: I was on the phone for just over three hours. 90 minutes of that was on hold waiting for the second level support (the product specialist), and another 10-15 was on hold waiting for the front line tech. I don't care if it is Sunday afternoon, Apple management are the ones who decided to release this on Friday 6 p.m. and they ought to have been prepared for the call volume. Of course all customers get is a sorry for the inconvenience, no offer of any kind of restitution for my time.</p>
<p>I'm also a bit concerned that the drivers for my Ximeta NAS drive won't seem to load at this point; making a fresh backup right away with Time Machine or iBackup seems like a very good idea. Sent off a support email to Ximeta but they for sure don't work on Sundays.</p>
<p>Hopefully I'll have another post soon with positive notes about 10.5. For the few minutes I've had so far, I can only say that a number of the UI changes do look nice.</p>
