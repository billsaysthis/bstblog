<p><strong>Real temptation</strong></p>
<p>Over coffee this morning we were discussing a friend's Tivo-ized speed viewing of <a href="http://www.fox.com/temptation2/home.htm">Temptation Island 2</a> when an idea occured to me: why don't the producers try some real temptation on the next installment of this reality show? The first two installments have featured young and sexy couples tempted by <a href="http://www.fox.com/temptation2/singles/girls/linda.htm">young</a> and <a href="http://www.fox.com/temptation2/singles/guys/jeff.htm">sexy</a> singles. The intensity, I expect, comes more from the fact that the couples are relatively immature and not from the contrast with the home cooking. Next time out, the producers should use somewhat older couples, say mid-30s to mid-40s, but retain the early- to mid-20s tempter age range. Maybe even pick a couple or two that are <a href="http://www.thesimpsons.com/index.html">less than perfect physical specimens</a>. That would be different and provide an entirely different kind of temptation.</p>
