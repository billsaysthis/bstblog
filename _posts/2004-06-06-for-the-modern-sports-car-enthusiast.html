<p>The Big Guy sent over a link to a <a href="http://www.w2knews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=040607FA-Lotus" title="Warning: pops directly to an eight minute long Windows Media Clip">British TV clip</a> that is hilarious and exciting, showing off the <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/~tjthompson/myexige/exige.htm">Lotus Exige</a>.
