<p>What did you know and<br />When did you know it?</p>
<p>I was born in a clump of mud huts<br />On the back side of an unruly river<br />That rampaged over its banks often<br />Enough to wash our meager homes away<br />Enough to keep my clan ever hungry</p>
<p>What did you know and<br />When did you know it?</p>
<p>My father was taken by the flood<br />In the summer I turned nine<br />Out of respect my mother and I<br />Joined my older uncle's family<br />Joined, used loosely, used for anything</p>
<p>What did you know and<br />When did you know it?</p>
<p>I made sure my uncle was taken by the river<br />My ma's new babe was smothered days<br />Before in the night time; I couldn't sleep<br />After hearing her breath gurgle, softer<br />After seeing the blood seep from his throat</p>
<p>What did you know and<br />When did you know it?</p>
<p>Feet wandered me away, barely remembered<br />Down the river, down down away<br />Up to one morning when I came up to the<br />Emperor's train, gaudy colors flooding me, the<br />Emperor's brilliance lifting me up</p>
<p>What did you know and<br />When did you know it?</p>
<p>His train carried me to the capital city<br />Overwhelming all my senses while<br />Underneath the surface I felt my soul<br />Restored, slowly, to a semblance of life<br />Restored despite the ugliness at my core</p>
<p>What did you know and<br />When did you know it?</p>
<p>15 winters passed me by, the old dreams<br />Never far from mind, fireworks exploding<br />After weeks or months of peaceful sleep<br />Eyes drill through my dampened aura<br />Eyes that can't see the cage's stone bars</p>
<p>What did you know and<br />When did you know it?</p>
<p>I grew rich as a court favorite will<br />Learning the tools and the talk, never<br />Forgetting the cruel truth of my past<br />Hiding pain with fair talk, silks and liquors<br />Hiding in plain sight from my ghosts</p>
<p>What did you know and<br />When did you know it?</p>
<p>Until there were no more tricks nor places<br />Left to conceal me and I turned to the<br />Right and drove a jeweled dagger<br />Deep into my beloved emperor's chest<br />Deep into my mother's faded dream.</p>
