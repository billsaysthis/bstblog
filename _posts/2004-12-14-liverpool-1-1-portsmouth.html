<p>Game just ended. We dominated almost the entire way but could only score one goal after 71 minutes. Looked like a win even so but then there was one breakdown in the defense less than a minute before the end and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/click/rss/0.91/public/-/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/live_text/default.stm">we gave up</a> the tying goal. Stupid!!!!!!!!!!! So instead of taking six points from two winnable games <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_12_05_blog_archive.phtml#110280636634144134">Saturday</a> and today, we have just one. Arghhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!<br /></p>
