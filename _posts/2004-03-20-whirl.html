<p>The first two days, my shortened first week, at Intransa are over. Scoble, from the best I can tell, I'm the only blogger working there though I hope to spread the gospel in the future. How did it go? Pretty good, I'd have to say, and fortunately my boss seems to feel the same way. Making connections is easier here than at Sun, not too surprising, and similarly I'm seeing more flexibility and freedom in the coming workload. For instance I suggested something a little outside my scope to the Bossman and he said go for it. Nice. Being in an office after all this time is different but I suppose more of the old skillz will come back as the days go by.</p>
