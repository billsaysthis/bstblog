<p>Was just checking out the new My Yahoo! beta. Very nice to see <a href="http://www.metafilter.com">MetaFilter</a> listed as Popular From the Web and <a href="http://www.sportsfilter.com">SportsFilter</a> as one of the Top 10 Editor's Picks; selecting either gets you the site RSS feed. Indeed, if you search on the term 'billsaysthis' in the Add Content page you can even have the RSS feed for THIS VERY SITE, and I am truly proud to be included. Yes I am. Also, I like the new look, its nice, particularly the smoother graphics.</p>
