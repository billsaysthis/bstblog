<p>Though the rumor mill has been back and forth on whether or not director McG (<em>Charlie's Angels</em>) is actually going ahead with a new <a href="http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/s/superman.php">Superman</a> film, Superhero Hype! <a href="http://www.superherohype.com/superman/index.php?id=749">is now reporting</a> that the film is on and that Beyonce Knowles is likely to be cast as Lois Lane, with the possibility of Johnny Depp as uber-villain Lex Luthor. Knowles herself confirmed that she's going after the role in a recent TV interview but I think Depp's name is just being used to help the project along--he seems to be "up" for a role in nearly every big name movie that's potentially being made over the next few years thanks to his recent successes.</p>
