<p>James Snell <a href="http://www.snellspace.com/blog/archives/000045.html">wrote</a>, in response to the current discussion over Trent Lott and the accusation of general Republican racism, specifically over opposition to affirmative action:</p>
<p>"You know, I must've missed the part in Martin Luther King's speech that said, <em>"I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character </em><strong>[except when trying to get a job, bidding on a government contract, or applying to college].</strong>' Somehow, I don't think that's what Dr. King had in mind."</p>
<p>Respectfully, James, I think your opinion might be a little easier to verify if a white racist hadn't murdered Dr. King. If King had lived long enough to participate in the discussions and negotiations which took place in the '70s, after the movement achieved critical mass, we could have seen how his idealism translated into pragmatism. I'd love to see you post a specific quote/reference from King that actually supports your supposition. Affirmative action, especially when it was first used, certainly did have the support of nearly all the major civil rights leaders.</p>
<p>Further, if you think that right now today blacks and whites are treated equally and no measures are necessary to correct past inequalities, then you've obviously never been black. Perhaps affirmative action is not the best way means of correction but simply stating that color cannot be taken into account (in either direction) is surely worse. I'm not a Republican, to be sure, but I'm not a member of any other political party either either, FYI, but I do think that in this supposedly enlightened day and age the way people are treated based on trivial differences is a tragic farce.</p>
