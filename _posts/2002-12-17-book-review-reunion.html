<p>This particular Reunion is a 2001 Pip and Flinx novel from <a href="http://www.alandeanfoster.com">Alan Dean Foster</a>. Pretty good telling of part of the coming of age period of life of this complex, much travelled character. Flinx--Philip Lynx--is the product of far future (illegal) genetic engineering and he still doesn't know all that much about himself or his capabilities; this book has him running hard and fast after some of this information. An enjoyable read, Foster has been writing tasty SF candy for over 30 years now.</p>
<p>Next two books in this series, already written and turned into the publisher, and due out in 2003, are titled <em>Star Brake</em> and <em>Sliding Scales</em>; these will be the 21st and 22nd books in Foster's <em>Commonwealth</em> series.</p>
