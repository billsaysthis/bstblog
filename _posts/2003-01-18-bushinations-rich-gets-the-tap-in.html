<p>Following up on the news reports that President Bush's popularity is finally waning according to current polling, NY Times columnist Frank Rich takes the open shot and scores. In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/18/opinion/18RICH.html">Joe Millionaire for President</a> Rich notes many of the ways in which Bush and his cohort have the bait-and-switch down to a routine. Reminds me greatly of this week's episode of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Law_&amp;_Order/">Law and Order</a>, in which the defense attorney attempts to slip the question of guilt right past the jury by waving a blue and white flag in front of their eyes. Almost, but not quite, too late the prosecutors realize what's happening and explain to the jury why they should not fall for this magician's trick. Rich does the same with his essay and one can only hope it opens a few more eyes.</p>
