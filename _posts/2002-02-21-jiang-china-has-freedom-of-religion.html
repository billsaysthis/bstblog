<p>At a press conference today with President Bush, Chinese president Jiang Zemin <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43289-2002Feb21.html">claimed that China Has Freedom of Religion</a>. Yeah right. Jiang claimed to have read many different religious texts, but I think the one he has in mind in this instance is Orwell's 1984.</p>
