<p>In many classic tales, going back to the Book of Job, a man is put under intense pressure. Events simply pile bad results, hurt and injury atop each other so much that a break is unavoidable. In Job, of course, the man follows God's word and is saved. In American revenge movies that are so popular these days, the man fights back and destroys those responsible.</p>
<p>In movies the hero rarely pays a cost beyond that which draws him into the fight. In <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0233469/">Collateral Damage</a>, Arnold's character loses his wife and child but after that he pays no cost beyond a few bruises and utterly destroys the drug lord who took them. Real life rarely seems so clean; most fights do not leave the true fighter unscathed.</p>
<p>One wonders, pondering events, if one's nature can reach the other end of a descent into depths, to match one's opponent tit for tat, will leave one unsullied and still capable of better things.<br /></p>
