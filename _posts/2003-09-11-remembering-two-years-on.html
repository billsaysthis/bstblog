<p>"There are no words to express my sadness and anger at the animals who perpetrated <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/nyTimesHomeBombing7AM2.gif">this horror</a>." Those were my first written words <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_09_09_blog_archive.phtml#5615480">two years ago</a> and I really have few more all this time later. I can still see the images of the second aircraft slamming into the side of the WTC tower, flames spouting, and the video broadcast from as close to Ground Zero as TV crews could get. People covered, coated in dust, screaming, crying, bleeding. Hearing my sister's voice on the telephone before that, crying herself, telling me to just turn on the TV. While people in other countries grieved with us or celebrated our pain, America woke up.</p>
<p>I still can barely allow myself to think about this tragedy; just looking at the photo linked to the words "this horror" in the previous paragraph is painful. A couple of lines from Springsteen's <a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/songs/WalkLikeAMan.html">Walk Like a Man</a> come to mind:</p>
<p><em>Well so much has happened to me<br />
<br />That I don't understand</em></p>
<p>We've been to war twice, decimated two countries at a huge cost to our own, yet Osama bin Laden still remains out of reach, able to send messages taunting America and attempting to incite further hate and violence. Ground Zero is still giving up bits and pieces of the bodies embedded there.</p>
