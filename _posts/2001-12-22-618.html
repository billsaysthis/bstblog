<p><strong>Hating Internet Explorer</strong></p>
<p>It's my own fault. I really ought to change to <a href="http://www.opera.com">another browser</a>. There are a couple of reasons why I don't, such as the fact that the Blogger tools don't play well in Opera and the CSS controlling my page layout is different. But IE is pushing me to the limits of possibly even switching from Windows 2000 to Linux. The stupid software is crashing my machine on a daily basis with a <a href="http://www.daimyo.org/bsod/">Blue Screen of Death</a>. I would include a screenshot but of course that isn't possible unless I grab my digital camera quickly next time. The specific error message is</p>
<p>wait operation, attach process, or yield was attempted from a DPC routine</p>
<p>Then the machine goes into some odd process/terminal loop. The only solution is to pull the power, which on this laptop means power cord and battery. Of course the Microsoft help sites have no help for this problem. And just try and get any answer out of them without paying for support incident! Ugggh!!!!</p>
