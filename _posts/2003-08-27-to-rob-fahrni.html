<p>I am peeved. You <a href="http://www.crabapples.net/rob/archive/2003_08_24_default.htm#106183639399066175" title="San Carlos is 15 minutes away!">came all the way here</a> from Visalia for more than a whole day and didn't even call me for coffee. How ever do you explain that? And, oh yeah, forget my email, guess I ran in to that DNS problem too.<br />
<br />...<br />
<br />Okay, just kidding, don't get bent out of shape. (Did anyone else get the Visio joke?)</p>
