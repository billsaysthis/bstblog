<p>I have the nagging impression that Republicans were traditionally the people complaining about the revolving door between government service and private industry. Maybe I'm wrong, though, since (a) Tom Scully, the guy who just finished drafting the Medicare reform bill and getting it passed into law, has resigned and is "<a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N03248878.htm">weighing five offers</a>" from firms anxious for his insight into how the new law will work and (b) Darleen Druyun, the woman at Department of Defense who oversaw the absurd, overpriced Boeing 100 aircraft lease deal, went right to work at Boeing but then was forced out in an ethical stand by boeing's board last week.</p>
