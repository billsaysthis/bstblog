<p>Sadly, the great singer/songwriter has brain cancer (as <a href="http://www.artemisrecords.com/newsarticle.aspx?id=76">announced</a> back in September) and it's not in remission or miraculously cured. I've already written my tribute to him (<a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_10_27_blog_archive.phtml#85625372">Getting ready to say goodbye to Warren Z</a>) but most of the major rock writers are taking their turns too. After watching the sad results of the game today, and waiting for Alias, I scanned the NY Times and found this touching paen to Zevon by Jon Pareles: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/26/magazine/26ZEVON.html?8hpib">In His Time of Dying</a>. Of course plenty of biography but lots of good passages about what Zevon's doing in his final days; one can only hope he makes it a little while longer, at least, to finish this last recording.</p>
