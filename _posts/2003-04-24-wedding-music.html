<p>Since the Sweet One and I are keeping things small and simple, we're not hiring a band or DJ for the upcoming nuptials. Instead, we're making a custom CD (please don't report us to the bad people at the RIAA) with the following set of love ballads:</p>
<p>- Genesis, Follow You Follow Me<br />
<br />- Springsteen, All That Heaven Will Allow<br />
<br />- Chicago, Feeling Stronger Every Day<br />
<br />- Chicago, Baby What a Big Surprise<br />
<br />- Van Morrison, Moondance<br />
<br />- Van Morrison, Have I Told You Lately<br />
<br />- Stevie Wonder, My Cherie Amour<br />
<br />- Stevie Wonder, Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours<br />
<br />- Beatles, Something<br />
<br />- Bread, Everything I Own<br />
<br />- Barry White, Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe<br />
<br />- Styx, <strike>Mr. Roboto</strike> Babe<br />
<br />- Sinatra, I've got You Under My Skin<br />
<br />- McCartney, My Love<br />
<br />- Elvis Costello, Every Day I Write the Book</p>
<p>What, you expected headbanging deathmetal? With my Mom in the room, uh, yeah sure.</p>
