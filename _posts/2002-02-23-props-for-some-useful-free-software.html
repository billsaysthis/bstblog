<p>I started using two interesting pieces of software and thought I would mention them in case anyone else would like them too; also, they are both free as in beer and props to the authors for making them available. <a href="http://www.paessler.com/products/ieb/">IE Booster</a> is an add-in for Internet Explorer 6 that adds a number of functions to the IE6 context menu (a context menu is the menu that opens when you right click on a window) [<a href="http://www.philringnalda.com/main/" title="The Blogger answer man!">Phil Ringnalda</a>]. The other is <a href="http://www.crazybrowser.com/">Crazy Browser</a>, an application that lets one open multiple Internet Explorer instances in one window instead of one window per instance [via <a href="http://www.platypus.ro/index.php">Canned Platypus</a>]. In fact, both were used in writing this entry. <em>Thanks guys!</em></p>
