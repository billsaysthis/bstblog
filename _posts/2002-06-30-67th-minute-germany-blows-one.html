<p>Yes! Rivaldo takes a long left-footed blast, Khan blocks it but cannot control and Ronaldo is right there to slam it home! Ronaldo nets for his seventh goal of this tournament and 11th all time to leave him only one goal behind Pele on the Brazilian scoring sheet; unless Klose gets a hat trick in the last 20, Ronaldo will definitely take the Golden Shoe.</p>
