<p>Diet Pepsi is the drink of choice for punk rockers? Seems ridiculous to me but that's what their commercial during the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction celebration said. Chrissie Hynde, the performer just before the commercial break, has more punk in her right index finger all these years down the road than the entire executive staff at Pepsico has had their entire lives.</p>
