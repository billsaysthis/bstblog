<p><b>Suggested H-1B restriction unconstitutional?</b></p>
<p>Steven <a href="http://denbeste.nu/entries/00001269.shtml">points out</a> that my suggestion could likely run up against section 1 of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which requires equal protection of all people.</p>
<p>Since the people here on H-1B visas are given entry and the ability to work on terms and conditions set by Congress, one would think Congress has the legal ability to make those conditions as I suggest as easily as the conditions that currently exist. Steven's point may well be valid, IANAL, but I don't see that conflict quite so clearly. If the law requires such treatment then how come Congress could require that these people leave after six years or within four weeks of being terminated by their employer?</p>
<p>Further, for an example in a completely different venue, many states charge a different tuition to residents and non-residents for attending state-run colleges, thus discriminating against some people. One would think, though, after all the time this has been in effect that any possible constitutional challenges would have come to pass and yet those different tuitions are still with us.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://denbeste.nu/ubb-cgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f=1&amp;t=000297">discussion going on</a> at USS Clueless</p>
