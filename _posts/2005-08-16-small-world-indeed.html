<p>There is another <a href="http://www.bill-lazar.com/">Bill Lazar</a> in Mountain View, he's lived here longer than me, but today was the first time in over eight years that I got a phone call intended for him. Unfortunately the caller got my voicemail and though her message was to cancel an appointment she didn't leave a callback number. Oh well.</p>
