<p>Last year today I <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_04_28_blog_archive.phtml#85059799">looked back</a> at the day of my birth. I can confirm that my parents are still not Martians, either fo them, but that they are still wonderful people and I have dificulty imagining a better pair, plus a great sister who is also non-Martian. What I didn't have a year ago was a wedding coming up in six days. Oh yeah, TS1 is almost in the trap from which she will never escape! Although this could be the five cups of coffee talking, as I've had an extreme yen for the stuff today. For those of you who don't understand this entry's title, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_05_06_blog_archive.phtml#3603792">here</a>.</p>
