<p>Well isn't this exciting! Or not. But only three days before the first birthday of this site, the visit counter scrolled past 10,000:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/10k_3_8_02.jpg" alt="10,006 visitors as of March 8, 2002" /></p>
<p>Visitor 10,000 was, of course, anonymous since I don't use cookies or logins or other tracking methods but I can tell from the referrer logs that this person came to the site after searching Google for "George Carlin" +quotes. My Carlin page actually gets quite a few hits and ranks fairly high at Google; on this term, this site <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22george+carlin%22+%2Bquotes">ranked 21</a> and for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22george+carlin%22">simply "George Carlin" is 48</a>. Cool.</p>
<p>Of course, I missed out on the huge rush of traffic in the first 4.5 months the site was online since I only started tracking visitors on July 27 and since visitors using Netscape Navigator are not recorded (grrrr! Darn Sitemeter) the total is probably somewhat higher than 10,000. Still, a joyous occasion and I will be sure to get an extra coffee at breakfast this morning. Thanks for all you people who come more than once. [Since Blogger was down for a server upgrade, this was written before breakfast but posted a few hours later. At the time I type this, the counter is up to a whopping 10,030.]</p>
