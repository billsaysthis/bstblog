<p><b>Yesterday's Book: Safe House</b><br />

<p>This <a href="http://www.vachss.com/av_novels/safe_house_more.html">novel</a> by Andrew Vachss, is part of the dozen novel Burke series (with a new one due in Sptember). Burke is an ultimate New York hard guy, never had a chance growing up in a series of foster homes and the like and graduating directly into a series of prison terms, but he and his "family" are always willing to work on the side of the righteous for a price. Author Vachss is a lawyer specializing in representation of children and education of the public on <a href="http://www.vachss.com/av_interviews/fat_free_radio.html">child abuse issues</a>, so I'm not surprised that the central problem in Safe House revolves around women plagues by stalkers. Without getting preachy, he effectively works in the stories of several women (usually with children) facing stalkers. The dialogue is harsh and, except for each other, the characters care little for the safety or regard of others. I was taken enough with Burke and <a href="http://www.vachss.com/av_novels/burke_novels.html">his world</a> to plan on reading more.</p>
