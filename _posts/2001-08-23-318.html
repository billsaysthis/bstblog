<p><b>Definite weirdness 3</b><br />

<p>The techies are piling it up lately. Here is a specification submitted to the Internet Engineering Task Force proposing a <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hodges-dtv-chanchange-00.txt">Digital TV Channel Changing Protocol</a> from <a href="mailto:rh@matriplex.com">Richard Hodges</a>. Checking out the website for his email address, <a href="http://www.matriplex.com/">Matriplex.com</a>, I have to believe this is for real. The proposal is full of technical details and is justified:</p>
<p>Advances in video compression techniques and new technology for delivering broadband services are making digital television (DTV) services practical and marketable.  One of the missing elements is a flexible and open protocol for DTV clients to request desired video/audio streams, or "channel changing".</p>
<p>I suppose he's right, but what is more needed is a good online program guide.</p>
