<p>Reality shows suck, there is not a single one I think is worth being on television, and I don't understand how they've become so successful the last few years. And it's only getting worse with new crap ideas--and plenty of ripoffs and imitations--coming in the next weeks. Do yourself a big favor and skip them all.<br /></p>
