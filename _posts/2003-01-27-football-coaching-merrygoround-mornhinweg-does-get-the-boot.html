<p>Usually the NFL puts a moratorium on announcement of coaching changes during the week leading up to the Super Bowl. Since that's over, so is the silence. The Detroit Lions didn't wait long, just a few hours, <a href="http://www.freep.com/news/latestnews/pm12796_20030127.htm">to announce</a> that Marty Mornhinweg was not going to get the chance to stick around. Instantly, the Net became full of rumors that recently ex-49ers coach Steve Mariucci would be named to the job.</p>
<p>Matt Millen, team president and himself the subject of termination speculation, said there are "a bunch of candidates that we've discussed and we're comfortable with" but no one name is being given for now. Amusingly, Millen had only weeks ago announced the Mornhinweg (whose previous job was offensive coordinator for the Niners) would indeed return for a third season despite a 5-27 track record. Pressed at the news conference to explain the sudden change, Millen finally stammered that "It's a process that's always changing. You always have to look at everything and everybody out there." So expect a fairly quick announcement in the Motor City.</p>
<p>The other major vacancy is, of course, Mooch's old job. The 49ers haven't said much, although they are interviewing at least two minority candidates, but Bill Walsh has denied any interest in coming back at age 71. The two minority candidates are Jets DC Ted Cottrell and Patriots DC Romeo Crennel; other candidates include current Niners DC Jim Mora, Jr., though star defensive lineman Dana Stubblefield said last week that he could not support Mora, and Eagles OC Brad Childress. Walsh though the new man would be introduced by this coming weekend, so we'll (hopefully) soon find out.</p>
