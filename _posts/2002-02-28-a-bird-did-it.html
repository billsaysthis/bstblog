<p>So <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_02_24_blog_archive.phtml#10153363">yesterday's power outage</a> was caused, according to the wonderful folks at Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, by a bird flying into a substation. Knocked out power to 11,000 people for over two hours. A bird? How did a bird get inside in a way to create this kind of damage? One would hope that these single points of failure would be designed with the understanding that animals can be intrusive but apparently not.</p>
