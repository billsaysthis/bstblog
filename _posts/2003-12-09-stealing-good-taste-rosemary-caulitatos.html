<p><a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/food/eater.asp">John Owen</a>, author of <a href="http://www.carbolowdrate.com/site/598695/product/307-3677795">Low Carb Holiday Cookbook</a>, was on the <a href="http://www.waynebrady.com/">Wayne Brady Show</a> this afternoon and gave this tasty instruction set for a low carb substitute for mashed potatos (assuming I transcribed reasonably well, Owen doesn't give <em>any</em> free recipes on the site):</p>
<p>1 1/2 cup chicken stock total</p>
<p>Start w/ 3/4 cups of stock in a heated pot<br />
<br />6-8 cups of cauliflower, fresh or frozen<br />
<br />Over a medium flame, stir and add stock as cauliflower absorbs it</p>
<p>Transfer to a mixing bowl<br />
<br />Add a few ounces of Blue cheese, crumbled or chopped<br />
<br />Puree with a hand blender or food processor</p>
<p>Add couple of cloves of chopped fresh garlic<br />
<br />A tablespoon of rosemary<br />
<br />Blend a bit more</p>
<p>Put in casserole<br />
<br />Add a few pats of butter on top plus some ground pepper and salt<br />
<br />Bake in oven for 350d for 20 minutes</p>
