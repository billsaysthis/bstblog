<p><strong>Sports and patriotism: why?</strong><br />

<p><a href="http://lancearmstrong.com/">Lance Armstrong</a> is a great racing cyclist, having won the previous two Tour de France races and now <a href="http://espn.go.com/oly/news/2001/0721/1229151.html">leading his third</a>. But I'm not much of a cycling fan, I've only ever seen highlights on ESPN, and the times I've been interested are when Armstrong or <a href="http://www.roble.net/marquis/coaching/gregQ_A.html" title="Short interview from '95">Greg Lemond</a> (four times at the top: 1986, 1989, 1990, and 1991) have won. Otherwise, I could really care less. I'm not really <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=jingoistic">jingoistic</a> but there's just something about an American <a href="http://www.tigerwoodsisgod.com/" title="You have to see this one">athlete</a> or <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/sports/worldcup/columns/docs/ak071299.htm" title="1999 Women's World Cup">team</a> winning an international event that revvs me up.</p>
