<p>If the NFL was upset with Terrell Owens for pulling a Sharpie out of his sock after scoring Monday  in Seattle, wait until he pulls a trumpet out of his ass and plays some jazz after scoring this Sunday in New Orleans.</p>
<p>$5,000 fine for an "untucked shirt." What a load of cow pie. Football gets the ratings it does because the games are terrific entertainment, not because people want to admire the incredible athleticism. Be real, Paul Tagliabue, and stop harrassing the best wide receiver in today's game.</p>
