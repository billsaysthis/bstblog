<p><b>Today's book: Star Trek - The Genesis Wave, Book 1</b><br />

<p>Picking up 90 years after the stories of the second and third Star Trek movies (<a href="http://www.startrek.com/library/movies/ii_main.html">The Wrath of Khan</a> and <a href="http://www.startrek.com/library/movies/iii_main.html">The Search for Spock</a>), the Next Generation novel <a href="http://www.psiphi.org/cgi/upc-db/074341182X.html">The Genesis Wave, Book One</a> begins with the abduction of 135 year old Dr. Carol Marcus by beings unknown (unless you believe her and Jim Kirk's son has come back from the dead). Next, a <i>thing</i> incredibly similar to the Genesis Device destroys an inhabited planet and its off on a race to stop it and find the perpetrators. Only six days until the wave reaches Earth and then continues on to cut a swath through the Romulan Star Empire. Events build, planets are destroyed, and <a href="http://www.starfleet.com/">Star Fleet</a>, still reeling from the Dominion War (this is the Enterprise E and Geordi has his ocular implants), brings what forces it can to bear. Some of those forces mysteriously disappear. And the book ends with "Continued in <a href="http://www.psiphi.org/cgi/upc-db/0743411811.html">The Genesis Wave, Book 2</a>", which fortunately I have coming in a few days.</p>
<p>The book links are to <a href="http://www.psiphi.org/">Psi Phi</a>, which features a fully-searchable Star Trek Book Database that includes information on books past, present, and future plus schedules, cover artwork, and feature articles. Cool site.</p>
