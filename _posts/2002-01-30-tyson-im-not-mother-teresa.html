<p>Gee Mike after all these years, all these rapes, and all the ridiculous behavior I would have never guessed. Amazingly, the Nevada State Athletic Commission looked a few hundred million dollars of Vegas casino revenue in the face and<br />
<br /><a href="http://espn.go.com/boxing/news/2002/0128/1319188.html">denied Tyson request for license</a> anyway. Good going guys, showing us the system can work once in awhile. Some jurisdiction will ignore Tyson's track record and inability to behave like an adult and give the go ahead for his fight with Lennox Lewis but this is a nice thing to see.</p>
