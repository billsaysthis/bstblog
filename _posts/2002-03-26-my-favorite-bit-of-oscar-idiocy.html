<p>Some will criticize the dresses, the makeup, or the jewelry. To me, there was only one really sad site last night at the Oscar's and that was Jennifer Lopez's hairdo. Where did she get on the talent train? I mean, her music is formulaic and lowest common denominator and her acting is just sad. Who thinks she has more than a pretty smile going for her and, of course, the world's bootiest ass? And frankly, her ass doesn't do much for me.</p>
