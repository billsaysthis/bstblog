<p>If you're reading this on the page and not in an RSS reader, I'm trying to work out some strange behavior that's affecting only the first (most recent) blog post, inserting some width that's forcing the line the post's timestamp is on below the right hand links list. I didn't change anything that I know of, though I did try out the new Blogger image inclusion tool to no particular benefit.</p>
<p> <span style="font-style:italic;">2nd try</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span> Now it's between the post title and the first line of text. Er...</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">3rd try:</span> Really, I got nothing. There's no change in my Blogger template or stylesheet. Sometimes I just hate this web stuff. And then I take my medicine.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">4th try:</span> Trying all sorts of little template changes to no avail.</p>
