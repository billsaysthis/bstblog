<p>The fucktards at Fox cancelled <i>John Doe</i> while I was away and confirmed that <i>Firefly</i> is dead and buried. I hope the Fox execs don't ever bring out another science fiction-ish series that is serial rather than episodic because I sure as hell won't be watching and will be suggesting to others they avoid it as well because I'm sick and tired of getting caught up in a cool mythologies, stories and characters only to have them disappear far too soon. The way studios are handling series these days, I can just wait for the third or fourth season and some cable network will let me catch up once I know there'll be enough to make it worth my while.</p>
<p>The new show <i>Jake 2.0</i> coming on UPN in the Fall is a good example. Certainly sounds like the kind of series that I'd enjoy but also seems aas likely to succeed as, say, <i>Seven Days</i> and so I'll just wait. Maybe <i>Jake</i> will get renewed and I'll catch up over the Summer repeats, maybe I'll wait and see. But I don't expect to be watching when it first comes on.</p>
