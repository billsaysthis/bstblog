<p>Adam, I agree with you that <a href="http://ifindkarma.typepad.com/relax/2004/12/free_shipping.html">Free Shipping</a> is the bomb, the cat's meow and lots of other good things besides! Although I'm not sure about used Kleenex or overly large underwear. We all love free stuff, right, but what about the insidious ways in which free shipping turns into cheap plastic skates or 10 year old half-eaten grilled cheese sandwiches? Then all the free shipping in the world isn't going to get your sorry self out of the chair and into the <a href="http://www.rockhall.com/">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>.</p>
<p>Which, by the way, has Bruce on the front page as I bring it up in Firefox, along with this quote: "Rock 'n' Roll, man, it changed my life. It was like The Voice of America, coming into your home." And you know Bruce is about more than the free shipping.</p>
<p>Green Day, you give their new <em>American Idiot</em> <strong>*****</strong>. Five stars and I have yet to hear a track. They are the bomb in rock in 2004 from all that I've read; Billie Joe <em>gets</em> the web, in a Dave sense, because their website has an <a href="http://www.greenday.com/greenday.xml">RSS feed</a>! Though not a page that just lists the names of the three members, nor useful (perma)links to their discography, meaning I can't link direct to their own <em>American Idiot</em> page, so how weird is that?</p>
<p>BB King and Eric Clapton are on stage now, on the free TV, jamming on some classic blues riff and now here's Joe Walsh. The Funky Eagle still pulls the strings as well as ever but when he talks you know you're thinking he did a little too much of the free (fill in your own blank) that was going around back in the day. Everybody talks about that subject in a low voice these days, way past cool on the audience meter for sure.</p>
<p>Scoble, he <a href="http://redcouch.typepad.com/weblog/">knows about free</a>. I'd tell you all about it myself but, hell, I'm just drifting into a slow Funk 49 groove. So, so there's more another time.</p>
<p>But, have no doubt, I'm all about the free shipping. That is definitely a cool thing to have.</p>
