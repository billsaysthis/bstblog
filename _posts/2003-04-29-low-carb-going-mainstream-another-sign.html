<p>Low carb (Atkins et al) must really be making strides in the pocketbook arena--I just saw a commercial for CarbSolutions products on television! Not to mention Russell Stover now offers a line of low carb candies. One of my friends who follows the Atkins Approach keeps wondering when mainstream food companies will get interested in this market and I think the time is getting close.</p>
