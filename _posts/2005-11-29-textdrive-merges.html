<p>The hosting company where I just finished moving billsaysthis.com, TextDrive, announced today it was merging with <a href="http://blog.joyent.com/2005/11/joyent_acquires_textdrive">Joyent</a>, another small startup (discussion at <a href="http://forum.textdrive.com/viewtopic.php?id=7497">A Fireside Chat On the Events of the Day</a>). Doesn't seem to be too significant for me and TS1 except they increased the diskspace for my level account from 300MB to 1GB, which is nice. The CEO, <a href="http://">Dean Allen</a> of <a href="http://www.textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a> fame, explained that it makes TxD a stronger company and that's probably true. <a href="http://www.joyent.com">Joyent</a>, the new partner, is a web applications company which means they need serious hosting resources and TxD could use some help on the software side, seeing as how they're struggling a bit to get promised stats and account manager apps out to users. Good luck to the new combination!</p>
<p>One of the reasons I switched off PHPWebHosting (Guy, are you listening?) was to get Email over SSL. At BarCamp, Jake Appelbaum showed how significant that can be when wirelessly connected to the web. Despite several requests and trouble tickets PHPWH never came close to helping me find a workaround for their lack of support for this common standard. So tonight I found the <a href="http://kb.textdrive.com/article/setting-up-outlook-express-for-imap-and-smtp-authorization">TxD kb article</a> and turned it on.</p>
<p>What's the first thing that happens? Symantec Norton Anti-Virus throws up an error message! For some reason not explained even in <a href="http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/nav.nsf/docid/2001091807593406?Open&amp;src=&amp;docid=2004052013343006&amp;nsf=nav.nsf&amp;view=es_full&amp;dtype=&amp;prod=&amp;ver=&amp;osv=&amp;osv_lvl=&amp;seg=">this extensive online help article</a>, the software doesn't work with Email over SSL:</p>
<p>"Norton AntiVirus email scanning does not work with an ISP that is using the SSL protocol. Also, Norton AntiVirus email scanning will only scan email that arrives on default ports 110 or 25.</p>
<p>If your ISP uses the SSL protocol, then you must disable email scanning in order to send and receive email."</p>
<p>Wow. I mean seriously dudes just how many years and versions of this application do you need to get this feature in the bits?</p>
