<p>John Belushi. I remember driving on Sunset Boulevard the afternoon he passed away, hearing the news when I was only blocks from the hotel where it happened. He was amazing with physical comedy and wordplay. But romantic comedy was just too much of a stretch for him, in the years when he was still hitting the booze and drugs so hard; maybe if he'd lived another 15 or 20 years he would have grown into it but we'll never know. I always think of Bill Murray's film from the same period, <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0087980">The Razor's Edge</a>, when <i>Continental Divide</i> comes up.</p>
<p>So 1981's <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0082200">Continental Divide</a> was not the great leap forward he probably hope for. Blair Brown was beautiful and well-suited to the part of the nature nut love interest. Belushi played Ernie Souchak, a Chicago newspaper columnist, who needs to get out of town in a hurry and heads to the Rockies to try and get the inside story on Brown's ornithologist. He goes nuts in the wild, misses his cigarettes, comes on to her to a negative reception, but then charms her by hurting his back and getting attacked by a mountain lion. They fall in love but his time on the mountain is up and he returns to the city. Boo hoo. She comes to the city for a lecture, they have wild sex and can't say goodbye. Woo hoo. Neither can stand living where the other does but they get married anyway and then go home alone. Huh?</p>
