<p>Hugo Chavez attempted to seize power in Venezuela in a coup in 1992 but failed. Six years later he was able to convince the electorate to make him president by running on a populist platform. At first he was extremely successful and was able to have constitutional amendments and laws passed that increased his power and authority. Recently, though, the people of his country have seen Chavez for what he truly is: a dictator wannabe. The big industry is oil (this is the fourth biggest exporter in the world and number three supplier to America) and the million member oil workers union is out on strike after Chavez tried to put his own stooges in charge there. The unionists and supporters have taken to the streets of the capital, over 150,000 by some counts, demanding Chavez's resignation. In response, the president sent armed thugs who killed at least a dozen protesters. Now Chavez appears to be out and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/international/AP-Venezuela-Oil-Protest.html">the generals are in charge</a>.</p>
