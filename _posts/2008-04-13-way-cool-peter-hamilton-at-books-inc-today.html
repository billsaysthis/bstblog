<p>TS1, the Big guy and I turned out to see <a href="http://www.peterfhamilton.co.uk/">Peter F. Hamilton</a>, one of my favorite SF authors, at Books Inc. in downtown Mountain View this afternoon. Peter read a few pages from <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/content/singlepost.php?id=4207945195092381063&amp;titl=TheDreamingVoid&amp;sy=review">The Dreaming Void</a>, took many questions and then signed copies of his books.</p>
<p>Hamilton was very good natured, I'm sure he's heard all of the questions we asked dozens of times over, but for sure wasn't at all surprised when the first (by me) was has he finished <em>The Temporal Void</em>, book two of this trilogy, yet. Unlike earlier appearances promoting <span style="font-style:italic;">TDV</span>, today he could give this answer: "I emailed it to my publisher Tuesday, just before getting on the plane here." Sweet!</p>
<p>TS1 snapped a couple of pics with her iPhone when I got to the head of the signing line:</p>

<p>I had the British Commonwealth edition of this novel and mentioned being excited to find it while we were Down Under, months before the US publication. Peter asked where in NZ we visited and, after I answered Auckland and Queenstown, told me that he really liked Queenstown and Randstown in this novel is based on that lovely little vacation spot.</p>
