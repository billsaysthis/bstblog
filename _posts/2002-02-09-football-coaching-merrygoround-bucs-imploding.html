<p>Well, one day after the Bucs werethisclose to naming Marvin Lewis as head coach, they <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/columns/pasquarelli_len/1325129.html">dumped him</a>. And now GM Rich <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/columns/pasquarelli_len/1325723.html">McKay's future</a> with the Bucs is unclear, since he wanted Lewis and the Glazer boys told him no. On one hand this is not too surprising a development since ex-coach Tony Dungy was shown the door because he couldn't move the offense and Lewis has no track record on that side of the ball. On the other hand, their search has been so high profile, what with being jilted by Bill Parcells early on and being left with their noses pressed up against the Raiders window with a birght shiny Gruden doll just inside, that you'd think the team would go with the obvious choice and calm the storm. Lewis now appears resigned to another defensive coordinator stint, getting paid near head coach dollars, with Spurrier and the Redskins. Marv Levy, 76 years old and obviously bored out of his skull with five years of retirement, is offering his services on a one year deal (leaving the Bucs in position to grab Gruden when his contract expires), but the initial reaction from Tampa Bay is not too bright. Tick tock, tick tock boys!</p>
