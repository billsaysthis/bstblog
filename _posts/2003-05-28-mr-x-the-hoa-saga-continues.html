<p>[<a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_04_13_blog_archive.phtml#200151117">Remember</a>, I switch the gender of my antagonist in each post so as to not give clues to the person's real identity, s/he is far too likely to sue me.]</p>
<p>Those more serious measures I mentioned? We voted to issue a work order to our landscaping contractor to remove the illegally planted flowers as well as some supporting materials he installed. Gave a two week deadline to allow X to comply, and even let that slip (thanks to our management company, the board certainly didn't vote for it), but he chose to ignore us. Exactly as expected. Meanwhile X had a mediation service contact us to iron the issues from his perspective ("the Board is and has been harassing him") but since he is so far behind on dues we declined to participate until that is rectified. He offered a payment plan but no reason why we should accept, and so we didn't, voting to continue the collections process.</p>
<p>The mediator called me originally, instead of the person at our management company, since one of Mr. X's 'conditions' is that the management company not participate in the discussions. Very funny, isn't it? As if the Board would leave itself open to liability from other members by allowing that. I could tell from our three ot so conversations that the mediator is exactly the personality type one would expect in that job. Semi-amusing to talk to but I put him onto the management company and left it at that.</p>
<p>This week the landscaping contractor tried to remove the plantings and Mr. X saw them. He walked out and said if the workers continued he would call the police. Of course they stopped, it's not their place to have to deal with cops. But I've volunteered to be out with them next week, and to talk with the police in advance, so this will get done. Trust me.</p>
