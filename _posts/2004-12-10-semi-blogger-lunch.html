<p>I had lunch at Yahoo! yesterday with a couple of friends, the very famous <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/">Jeremy Zawodny</a> (who submits this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49724566@N00/2071059/">visual proof</a> taken with a tiny, USB flashdive-sized camera) and the internetly-anonymous SpoFite WorldCup2002. Very enjoyable, interesting discussions. Jeremy moves in some very high levels: he had lunch with Macromedia co-founder/Web pundit <a href="http://marc.blogs.it/">Marc Cantor</a> the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49724566@N00/2010113/">day before</a> and was chatting with one of Yahoo's co-founders and another C-level exec while waiting on line to get the sandwich he ate with us.</p>
