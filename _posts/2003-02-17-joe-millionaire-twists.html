<p>Who knows what the truth is, and, frankly, who cares? I sure don't but here's a few WAGs:<br />

<ol>
<li>Both the final two women (Sarah and Zora) are lesbians and when they find out he doesn't have the 50 large, they turn to each other for comfort and love.</li>
<li>Evan explains that, in a burst of honesty following the $50M revelation, one of his previous jobs was as male prostitute.</li>
<li>The losing female proclaims the true object of her affection is the Australian butler--he's cute and has that accent!</li>
</ol>
<p>Thankfully I have two TVs and will not be subjected to this mishigas!</p>
