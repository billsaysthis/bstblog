<p>Brett Farve played tonight, starting his 205th consecutive game at QB for Green Bay, even though his father died yesterday. Unexpectedly, a massive heart attack. The few shots I saw of him (didn't watch until well into the 3rd quarter) he was standing around on the sideline, chatting with teammates and such. Makes me think of Harry Chapin's old song <a href="http://www.littlejason.com/chapin/songs/catcrad.html">Cat's in the Cradle</a> and that Brett is behaving exactly as his Dad would expect.</p>
