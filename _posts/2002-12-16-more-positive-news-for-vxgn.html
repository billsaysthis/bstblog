<p>From CBS MarketWatch: <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/yhoo/story.asp?guid=%7BB9942979-5B56-47FA-844B-7192F270AA45%7D&amp;siteid=myyahoo&amp;dist=myyahoo">FDA gives VaxGen 'fast-track' status, stock surges</a>. Stock surges over $3/share, although the current $16.20 price is still way off the $23.25 high at the beginning of this month. Still, the Phase III results are due in the first quarter and will hopefully be positive enough to drive the stock price into the $30s or higher.</p>
