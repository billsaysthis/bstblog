<p>A sunny January day at the big mall in Costa Mesa<br />Jenny is looking for a new pair of black pumps<br />Trying on spangly dangling earrings and Ray-Bans<br />Seeing who there is to see on the stroll.</p>
<p>Mackenzie is at the same mall, checking out the<br />Talent on display--this is a place you go<br />Because you know you the goods for the show<br />Because you want people to  see your strut.</p>
<p>Very few people notice Mackenzie at the mall today,<br />Noticed him yesterday or last month or last year<br />You might think he's accustomed to social invisibility<br />But down inside he wants to be seen as much as Jenny.</p>
<p>He sees Jenny, in fact he likes the way she struts<br />Trying on those black pumps and would gladly<br />Buy them for her, or the jewelry or sunglasses<br />If Jenny would only look on him kindly.</p>
<p>Mac--he like to call himself Mac, nobody else<br />Thinks of him as a Mac kind of guy, not too many<br />People think of him too often as any kind of guy<br />People hardly look at him unless he spills coffee on them.</p>
<p>Mac thinks his hobby makes up for the dateless<br />Saturday nights, painful family holiday dinners where<br />He has no answer for his mother's withering looks<br />At the empty chair where his wife would sit.</p>
<p>Mom and Dad try to hide their sadness and<br />Growing disdain at Mac's continuing failure, his<br />Once promising but now dimming prospects,<br />See their bright and happy boy turn hollow and grey.</p>
<p>Jenny is still full of promise, just out of college,<br />Working for smart people at an exciting startup<br />More beautiful than as a high school cheerleader<br />Looking at her future reaching out to hold her.</p>
<p>Ten years from now people will start to call her<br />Jennifer but now, sweet, friendly, open<br />That's too formal to occur to the people she knows<br />She looks like Jenny to everyone.</p>
<p>Mac knows Jenny, he sees her at the mall on weekends<br />Grabbing coffee at lunch with girlfriends<br />Working out at the gym. The gym Mac joined to<br />See more of Jenny, and be seen by her.</p>
<p>Today is the day, Mac says. To himself, he has<br />No buddies to brag to or work up lines with<br />He's going to have a conversation with Jenny<br />See if she will spark to his flame.</p>
<p>Just in case she doesn't, Mac has a plan B.<br />Smart guys work up their options, he knows.<br />Mac's plan B is unconventional, 9mm's of hard steel,<br />Surely he won't need it, Jenny will see his love.</p>
