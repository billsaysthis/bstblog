<p>Landon Donovan scored two goals--the first multi-goal game by any player in MLS Cup history--and led the San Jose Earthquakes to their second MLS Cup victory in three seasons over the Chicago Fire 4-2 this afternoon; Donovan was also named the Finals MVP. Quakes Captain Jeff Agoos made some excellent defensive stands and got one (ring) for his thumb, his fifth MLS title as he won three early in the League's history with DC United. Several Cup Finals marks fell today: six goals made this the highest scoring game in history, Donovan's brace, fastest first goal and quickest three goal sequence; <a href="http://www.mlsnet.com/games/03/tracker.php?gamename=11232003_SJCHI&amp;version=tracker">game stats</a>.</p>
<p>Pat Onstad, named last night as MLS Goalkeeper of the Year, took care of business, especially when he had to shut down Fire scoring leader Ante Razov on a penalty kick in the 54th minute. The Quakes had taken a 2-0 halftime lead on goals by Ronnie Ekelund (5') and Donovan (38') but the Fire took one back quickly after the restart (speed demon DaMarcus Beasley, 49'). DaBeas, a real crowd pleaser and someone who gives the US National Team real width, put in the first of three quick scores--Richard Mulrooney answered for the Quakes less than a minute later, then the Fire got an own goal from San Jose defender Cliff Ronier--and Razov could have had the equalizer if not for our terrific keeper.</p>
<p>Razov apparently had the flu all week but the announcers didn't bother to mention it until the 84th minute, after criticizing him for not making anything of his opportunities during the game (eight shots on goal, including the PK, but no goals), which was just indicative of the generally poor work from ABC in televising the match. Then again, I've never been a fan of JP Dellacamera, the main soccer play by play man for ABC Sports (that is, including ESPN broadcasts as well). However, I am appreciative and thankful to the network for giving this game some valuable national exposure.</p>
<p>The Home Depot Center, regular season home of the LA Galaxy, was an excellent field for this match. Built specifically for soccer, the field is very large at 120 yards long by 75 wide and well-suited to the aggressive playing styles of both teams. The result was visible on the ground as there was little play in the midfield but rather a lot of up and down runs.</p>
<p>Bottom line: W00t to Donovan, Agoos, Onstad, Mulrooney, Ekelund, Brian Mullan, Jamil Walker, Dewayne Derosario, Eddie Robinson, Troy Dayak, Craig Waibel, Chris Roner, Manny Lagos and Ian Russell, coach Frank Yallop and the rest of the Earthquakes organization for a great season and a wonderful result!</p>
