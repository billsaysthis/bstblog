<p><b>Well, the bad news continues</b><br />

<p>In the mid-quarter update, Michael Lehman (Sun CFO) blamed <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010529/bs/tech_sunmicro_outlook_dc_3.html">Europe for Sales Drop</a>, although others pointed to resales from dead and dying dot-coms for some of the drop in the sales. New expectations are for $3.8-4.0 billion in sales for the current quarter compared to the previous forecast of $4.4 billion, with earnings per share at 2-4 cents versus 6 cents. The stock was trading below $18 in the after market.</p>
