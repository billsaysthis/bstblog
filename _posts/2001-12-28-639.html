<p><strong>Micro-advertising experiment, day 13</strong></p>
<p>A very odd up and down pattern is emerging in the data: up down up down and over again; people must have been really at loose ends Monday for such a high percentage to come through. Thursday was not much of a day for the ad, only four clickthroughs out of 410 views for a 0.98% CTR. The total now is 62 views from 4,340 views for a 1.43% cumulative CTR. The ad buy must be close to the end, with only 660 left, about two days. Overall site traffic seems to be up since <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_12_02_blog_archive.phtml#7688286">passing 4,000</a> on Dec. 5, with about 900 visitors in the past three weeks.</p>
