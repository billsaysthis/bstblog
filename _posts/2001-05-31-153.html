<p><b>Coach K: Staying Young</b><br />

<p>26 years as a head coach has produced 606 wins, nine trips to the Final Four and three national title for <a href="http://www.fansonly.com/schools/duke/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/coachkbioo.html" title="Official bio">Mike Krzyzewski</a> gets him <a href="http://www.fansonly.com/schools/duke/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/053001aaa.html">inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame</a> at age 52. Seven years ago, though, people were thinking he was at the end of the road due to back and hip problems; instead, as Gregg Doyel writes, <a href="http://espn.go.com/ncb/columns/doyel_gregg/1207788.html">winning keeps Coach K feeling young</a>. He's still having fun, still loving the life, plenty of years left in the tank and, most likely, on the top. I'm sure I'll be rooting for the Dukies in the Big Dance for a long time.</p>
