<p>Saw a mention of a report yesterday on NPR's <span style="font-style:italic;">All Things Considered</span> called <a href="http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=3919240">Pre-Glory Days: The Earliest Springsteen Recordings</a> and I was expecting something really cool since the article claimed the tapes had about 80 minutes of music Bruce made with his first band, <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2004/sep/castiles/castiles_big.html">The Castiles</a>, but all they had was a few seconds here and there in the background underneath some trivial interviews. And three brief (maybe 30 seconds long) song clips. I wonder if NPR was concerned about rights issues but for all the hype the report got there was no real meat.<br /></p>
