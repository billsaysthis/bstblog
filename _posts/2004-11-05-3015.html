<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/disney/cars/">Cars</a>: When they say teaser trailer, they mean it. Still, next year's Pixar/Disney release (the last of their collaborations?) looks interesting from this couple of minutes. People are Cars, get it? No plot revealed at all in this clip and no way to even know if the featured cars will be characters in the film.<br /></p>
