<p><a href="http://www.wcbo.org/">World Chess Boxing Organization</a> Yes, your eyes are working properly! This is the governing body for the new sport that blends chess and boxing, alternating between them for 11 rounds. The same two guys, not a brain for the chess portion and another for the fisticuffs. I remain convinced that boxing is a throwback which does little good in our culture and is the type of entertainment that makes me cringe. But at least I got a big laugh from finding out about this.</p>
