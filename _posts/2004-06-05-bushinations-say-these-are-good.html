<p>Jeffrey Sachs, writing in the NY Times, looks at foreign aid as a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/05/opinion/05SACH.html?ex=1401854400&amp;en=325fd37751890a8d&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">tool of national security</a> (JRobb, this would be a good piece for a <a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/">Global Guerrillas</a> post). I definitely agree with Sachs' main points; consider how much positive work could be accomplished by shifting $15 billion from Defense (-3.3% of budget) to Aid (+100% of budget) and how much insight into problems and potential problems we will get as a result.</p>
<p>Rumsfeld says he is worried America <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/apeurope_story.asp?category=1103&amp;slug=Rumsfeld%20Terrorism">is losing the wider war</a> against terrorism, "It's quite clear to me that we do not have a coherent approach to this." So, Mr. Secretary, wouldn't putting our feet on the ground in a supportive, productive manner be a good way to get clearer? Or is violence and skullduggery the only approach you know?</p>
<p>With Tenet and his top deputy for clandestine ops leaving the CIA and the FBI caught up in a tizzy over domestic intelligence, right now would be a great time to brainstorm both how we gather and evaluate knowledge about the wider world, how we interact with others. We've reached a cusp and the question is whether the Administration, or Kerry when he wins in November for that matter, can grasp it in a positive way rather than following a worn-out path.</p>
