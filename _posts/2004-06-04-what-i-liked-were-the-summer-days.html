<p>What I liked were the Summer days<br />
<br />When I could wear a loose pair of shorts<br />
<br />With a short sleeve shirt pulled out<br />
<br />Sneakers or dock shoes, no socks</p>
<p>Now I wear two shirts every day<br />
<br />Because the office is ice cold<br />
<br />I have to tuck the shirts in to<br />
<br />Long pants because appearance counts</p>
<p>We got up early every morning<br />
<br />Either going to the gym or Vivian<br />
<br />Wanted to catch an earlier train<br />
<br />So then I could have coffee and surf</p>
<p>Now we get up early every morning<br />
<br />Still go to the gym and catch earlier trains<br />
<br />But I have to head to the office<br />
<br />Straight from the train station</p>
<p>I had time to walk to the corner<br />
<br />With Evan, chitchat about politics<br />
<br />Geeky stuff, a new fish tank or<br />
<br />Just think to myself about whatever</p>
<p>Now I'm lucky to get one morning walk<br />
<br />On the weekend, the talk is not as fresh,<br />
<br />People at the office are nice but not the same<br />
<br />Coffee at the office is nowhere near as good</p>
