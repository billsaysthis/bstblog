<p>My alarm is set to go off at 5:50 weekdays so TS1 and I can go the gym before work. This morning, though, I woke up screaming in pain about 15 minutes before the alarm could annoy us from a terribly powerful muscle spasm on the back of my left calf.</p>
<p>I mean terrible in the worst way, I felt like the muscle was trying to pull itself right out of my leg. Worse, nothing I did could relieve the pain, not stretching or relaxing, light massage, lifting the leg up, putting it down. Lasted for about a minute.</p>
<p>Very sorry for the screaming to wake up Sweetie but what could I do? I can't remember the last time I felt such pain. I have had a few of these spasms before though none of them were so strong. Even now, over two hours, a shower and 20 minutes with a heating pad later, the muscle is still tender and pulsing.</p>
<p>Somehow the alarm clock doesn't seem so bad by comparison.</p>
