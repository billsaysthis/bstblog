<p><a href="http://www.bloomsbury.com/tsunami/">New Beginnings</a> is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1596910542/bloomsburymag-20/102-4004615-3962554" title="Amazon link">paperback book</a> that collects the first chapters of new, as yet unpublished novels by top name authors and its sales (US cover price is $9.95, ISBN 1596910542) will benefit Tsunami victims. Two of my favorite novelists, <a href="http://www.harlancoben.com/">Harlan Coben</a> and Nick Hornby, are among those donating work: Harlan's is from <a href="http://www.harlancoben.com/static/novels/ti.htm" title="In stores April 26">The Innocent</a> and Hornby's from <a href="http://www.penguincatalogue.co.uk/lo/general/title.html?catalogueId=3&amp;imprintId=15&amp;titleId=268" title="Due in May">A Long Way Down</a>. Also participating, to name a few, are Steven King, JM Coetzee, Margaret Atwood, Maeve Binchy and Scott Turow. Nobody took up the offer two months ago to trade my Amazon gift certificate received as a holiday present for a donation, so this will be a good purchase for me.</p>
