<p>Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant. Romantic Comedy. Above average script, some good laughs and sweetness. 2002's <a href="http://twoweeksnoticemovie.warnerbros.com/">Two Weeks Notice</a>. Marc Lawrence seems to be Bullock's <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0492909/">personal writer</a> these days and gets his first directorial opportunity here too. A little incongruity the way Bullock's activist lawyer just agrees to be chief counsel to Grant's real estate developer or that he'd hire her even with a Harvard Law School degree but otherwise fine.</p>
<p><em>Recommended</em></p>
