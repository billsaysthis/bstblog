<p>Well, face it, the time has come and gone for this archaic concept anyway. The <a href="http://www.eweek.com/print_article/0,1761,a=130746,00.asp">recent Court of Appeals ruling</a> holding email free from traditional protections, where technology ran ahead of the law, is but one more foot stomping your personal preference into the mud. Get used to it.</p>
<p>California's legislators are trying to do some good for their constituents, running against the tidal wave of corporate lobbying. For an example look at <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/07/02/EDG3K7ELGG1.DTL">last year's SB-1</a>, which became effective yesterday after a judge refused a request from banks and other financial companies to block it; the law requires financial companies to obtain customers' permission before selling or sharing their personal information. Bankers <a href="http://www.aba.com/Press+Room/070104statement.htm">are very unhappy</a>, not surprising since selling this data reportedly gives them $400 million a year in revenue, and will appeal even though they stood up and supported the bill when the final compromise (the original restrictions were much tougher) was announced.</p>
