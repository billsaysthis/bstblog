<p>I'm a sucker for cool computer shit, actually any cool techie stuff, so that probably explains some of my excitement watching <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/productinfo/default.aspx">this Microsoft Longhorn application demo</a>. The presenter, one of the Longhorn evangalists not named <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/01/05.html#a6085">Robert Scoble</a>, states that the demo takes advantage of new features in the Avalon, WinFS and Indigo subsystems to produce what would be a really impressive real estate application from a new company called <a href="http://www.re3w.com:8080/re3w-pre/index.jsp">RE3W</a> if it really worked as shown. The application works across company lines using secure connectivity, integrates communication (email and IM, I think), sophisticated graphics to bring an amazing level of automation to the commercial real estate purchase process. I would love to find out, however, how much of the application's  impressive functionality <em>requires</em> Longhorn's capabilities and how much can be done today using, say, C++ or Java even though more coding would be necessary.</p>
