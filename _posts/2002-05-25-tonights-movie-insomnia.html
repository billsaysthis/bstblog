<p>About a Boy was sold out so we switched around the schedule and saw <a href="http://dontcloseyoureyes.warnerbros.com/">Insomnia</a> instead. Make no mistake, this is an Al Pacino acting showcase. Hilary Swank is alright but has a fairly small role; Robin Williams' part is bigger and he does a superb job, very understated and quite the opposite of his work in, for example, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_03_24_blog_archive.phtml#75046466">Death to Smoochy</a>. But Pacino is the man here, in every scene, making every important move. His eyes, burdened with the weight of being awake, seem like they weigh half a ton by the end. Director Christopher Nolan (<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0209144">Memento</a>) makes excellent use of the round the clock sunlight in Alaskan summers. And maybe it was just me but I thought the ending was ambiguous enough to give one some hope for Pacino's detective. <em>Recommended</em></p>
