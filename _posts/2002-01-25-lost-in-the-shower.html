<p>This is kind of like daydreaming, only you do it in the shower. And you kind of meander into it, not through any conscious choice or direction. One minute your happily going through the shower routine, wash the hands, wash the face, shampoo the hair...next thing you know you think you're all done but you don't remember if you lathered the soap up and down your body. I get lost thinking about some topic of the day or some fantasy woman or things I want/need/ought to do that day. Did I finish everything that was supposed to be washed? I just don't know. Does this every <a href="mailto:bill@bilsaysthis.com?subject=shower">happen to you</a>?</p>
