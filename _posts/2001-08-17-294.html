<p><b>Initial update to the look and structure of BillSaysThis</b><br />

<p>Tonight I implemented the initial change to this website. You'll notice that the weblog is now occupying the right half of the main page and some of the links that used to be on this page, particularly the set of daily links, are gone. I'm working with a friend who is an artist (and aspires to one day be an Artist) on a new layout, color scheme, navigation, and so forth and I decided to implement this part of the change tonight. The weblog archive pages look plain for now but I will be updating that soon.</p>
