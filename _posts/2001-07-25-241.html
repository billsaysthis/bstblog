<p><b>Publishing Science Fiction</b><br />

<p>I've been reading <a href="http://www.analogsf.com">Analog</a> more or less continuously since the late '60s and for most of that time <a href="http://www.lrcpubs.com/artemismagazine/issue01/gengap1.html" title="Schmidt's Hugo nominated story from Artemis Magazine Spring 200 issue">Stan Schmidt</a> has been the editor. <a href="http://www.scifi.com/">Science Fiction Weekly</a>, my favorite online SF magazine, has new author <a href="http://www.analogsf.com/0107/KaddishSurvivor.html" title="Link is to Burstein's Hugo Award nominee story">Michael Burstein</a> <a href="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue222/interview.html">interview Schmidt</a> in the current issue and he has a few interesting things to say about the state of print SF magazine publishing.</p>
