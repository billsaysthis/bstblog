<p><b>Some people are sick, others just wacky (2)</b></p>
<p>Salon reports on a Russian teen with <a href="http://www.salon.com/sex/world/2001/09/11/electric/index.html">Something up his sleeve</a>. A new penis, to be precise, since the kid burned the original off peeing on a Russian fence. Doctors grew skin on his arm and then grafted that along with surgically rebuilt plumbing back in place. In a bad sign for the future of the human race, he is likely to get back sexual functionality and let's just hope that doesn't include reproductive capability. Has anyone called the <a href="http://www.darwinawards.com">Darwin Awards</a> people yet?</p>
