<p>Not surprisingly after claiming he would not be outbid, Jim Irsay is a happy man today after <a href="http://msn.espn.go.com/nfl/news/2002/0122/1315433.html">Dungy accepted his offer to coach Indianapolis</a>. Can he pull off a St. Louis-like defensive turnaround and get a healthy Edgarrin James back? Those are the two keys to making the playoffs next year after the Colts didn't even come close this season. Dungy will retain offensive coordinator Tom Moore, which is going to make the triplets (Manning, Harrison, and James) happy.</p>
