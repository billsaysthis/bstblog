<p><strong>Football coaching merrygoround: There's humor, of course</strong></p>
<p>The ESPN.com Page2 staff, in <a href="http://espn.go.com/page2/s/coaches/fired.html">Ready, aim ... fire!</a>, has come up with their own parody of all the changes--the article gives a reason to fire all 31 coaches, even one day on the job Steve Spurrier! And in real though humourous turns, the Bucs have admitted they are on the prowl for some Tuna, 76 year young Marv Levy has contacted the Colts (Tony Dungy appears to be the frontrunner for that job), and Marty Schottenheimer, who one would think is ready for some fishing, and Norv Turner, who one would think just ought to know better, are both interviewing for the Charger gig that Tuna apparently has turned down.</p>
