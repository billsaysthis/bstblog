<p>Squidoo is out of private beta, so you can see my <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/brucespringsteen">Bruce Springsteen lens</a> and rejoice. However, I'm not sure how long my effort there will remain living as I just received a rude note from their system:<br /><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><br />
<blockquote><span style="font-style:italic;">Hello, Beta User </span></p>
<p>  <span style="font-style:italic;">As Lensmaster for the Squidoo Lens 'Bruce Springsteen', you are receiving this notification that your Lens will be deleted in 4 days unless you improve it.</span></p>
<p>  <span style="font-style:italic;">Improved lenses are defined as lenses that have been published with two or more modules; unimproved lenses are deleted automatically after 7 days.</span></p>
<p>  <span style="font-style:italic;">Sincerely,</span><br />  <span style="font-style:italic;">The Squidoo Team</span></p></blockquote>
<p>My response:<br />
<blockquote>Today I got an email saying that my lens hasn't had a change recently enough and if I didn't do one soon it would be deleted in four days.</p>
<p>What the fuck? Life is not busy enough that now I have to put 'update Squidoo' on my weekly activity list? Isn't it enough that I participated in the private beta and filed bugs for you guys? Even if not, what if I get too busy at work, get sick, go on a two week vacation?</p>
<p>Seriously, you guys better be kidding. This one is going on my blog.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/">Seth Godin</a>, the leader behind Squidoo, is often referred to as a post-modern marketing genius and not without some justification. But this is just stupid. Guys, go ahead and delete me now if you're not going to change this policy because pigs (sponsored by Yahoo!) will be flying over the Mountain View skies before I bother to do another update.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Later:</span> Godin just posted <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/blog/?p=20">this explanation</a>. I don't see how he thinks its sufficient if the policy is still that <span style="font-style:italic;">lensmasters</span> must do some type of work on each lens at least once every two weeks. And his attempted humor didn't strike me as funny either.</p>
