<p><b>Tonight's movie: Boss of Bosses</b><br />

<p>I like mob movies. <a href="http://www.hbo.com/sopranos">Sopranos</a>, Goodfellas, Godfather, Casino. Unquestionably, all of these have characters who are unquestionably bad but with whom we come to identify and cheer on. But <a href="http://www.tnt.tv/movies/tntoriginals/bossofbosses/">Boss of Bosses</a>, a made for cable original that premiered tonight on TNT, goes to far in making <a href="http://www.ipsn.org/castell.html">Paul Castellano</a> into a good guy. He kills people but hates that he must and this gives him nightmares.</p>
<p>And beyond the amazingly poor taste shown in Castellano's characterization, the film explicitly lies about a key factor in his downfall. In the film, his maid (also his lover) tells the FBI to go screw when they approach her for help; in reality, the FBI planted bugs in Castellano's home with the woman's help and it was she who told the FBI that Castellano often sat at his kitchen table to discuss business.</p>
<p>This will film not be joining the others mentioned in the mob film hall of fame.</p>
