<p>Targeting the initial voyage for 2018, astronaut Buzz Aldrin and a team of engineering researchers at Purdue university are <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/space/02/06/aldrin.hotel.reut/index.html">planning a space hotel</a> (50 guests, all the creature comforts) that will cycle back and forth to Mars (the trip is six to eight months each way). In 16 years I'll be 56, give them a few voyages to work the kinks out, so I expect to be on this ship sometime in the mid 2020s. Cool!</p>
