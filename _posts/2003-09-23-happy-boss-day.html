<p>Bruce turned 54 years old today. Amazing that he's still make new, evolving, relevant music compared to so many of the 'older' rockers who're out there just pulling in the cash for Greatest Hits and Live repackagings and an umpteenth tour playing those same songs. Mr. Jagger, Mr. Townsend, Mr. Simmons, do you hear me?</p>
