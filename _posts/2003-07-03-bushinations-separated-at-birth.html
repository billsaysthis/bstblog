<p>Texas: Republicans <a href="http://asia.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=politicsNews&amp;storyID=3035287">try to steamroller</a> an extra Congressional redistricting. This is the leadership's second attempt after the Democrats foiled them a while back by fleeing to Oklahoma.</p>
<p>California: Republicans <a href="http://www.republicansagainsttherecall.com/news-nctimes-062403.htm">try to recall</a> Gray Davis, less than a year after his re-election. though not all state Republicans <a href="http://www.republicansagainsttherecall.com/">are in favor</a>. Darrell Issa, a Republican Congressman who made millions providing Americans with devices to evade the police, is putting up a huge amount of money (somewhere around $1,000,000) to fund the recall campaign; Issa, of course, has declared himself a candidate to replace Davis should the recall make the ballot.</p>
