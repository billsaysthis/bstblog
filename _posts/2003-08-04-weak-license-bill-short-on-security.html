<p>[Another letter to the San Jose Mercury News, though I cannot find this particular editorial online yet.]</p>
<p>In today's editorial on a State Senate bill that would allow illegal immigrants to hold California driver's licenses, you write that the bill would change the fact that many of these people are currently driving illegally. How, I wonder, would they be driving legally even after passage when such people are breaking the law simply by their presence in the country? The Mercury News' repeated pandering to its Latino readership through such illogical editorials and other articles only perpetuates the problem California, in particular, faces from a group of people who show no respect for this nation or its laws.</p>
