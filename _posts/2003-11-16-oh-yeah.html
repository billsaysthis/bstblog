<p>Landon Donovan did it again, babies, scoring the golden goal tonight in the 117th minute of the MLS Western Conference finals to lead the Earthquakes to a 3-2 win over Kansas City. Second game in a row that the Quakes had to come from behind and did. I thought the referee wasn't all there and missed badly on a foul in the box that he didn't call that would have given San Jose a penalty about two minutes before the winner. But, oh yeah, Landon was the Man!</p>
