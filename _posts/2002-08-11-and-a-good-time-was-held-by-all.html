<p>A small dinner party was held here last night to celebrate the Sweet One's mublety-mublety birthday (a gentleman does not ask a lady's true age, but this observer must say that she looks far younger than her age) and was quite a lot of fun. The cake was particularly good:</p>

<p>The main dish, cooked by yours truly, was an ambition effort into the land of <a href="http://www.emeril.com">Emeril Lagasse</a>, a three part effort called <a href="http://www.foodtv.com/foodtv/recipe/0,6255,22415,00.html">Mushroom Stuffed Chicken Breasts with Light Pan Sauce and Braised Celery</a>. Trust me, it was more difficult than it sounds, but the end result was very tasty. Probably would have been easier had I seen the show on which it was prepared but I needed a chicken and mushroom dish that could be set up before the company arrived. Vivian's friend Aggar brought a choice Sausage and Peppers side dish, Vivian's sister Nancy C. brought the green salad, and Nancy D. came through with a cheesy zuccini casserole.</p>
<p>Nancy D. also brought <a href="http://www.boardgames.com/guesstures.html">Guesstures</a> and we had fun while the Ladies beat the Men badly.</p>
<p>Who all came, you ask? Here's a couple of shots:</p>

<p>Best of all, the Sweet One had a wonderful day. Considering how great she treats me every day, it's little enough that I can do in return.</p>
