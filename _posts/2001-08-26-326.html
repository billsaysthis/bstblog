<p><b>Artists's Rights</b></p>
<p>Everyone assumes that when you hear a song on the radio over and over that the song's selling large quantities of CDs. Probably is. And that the musicians are making large quantities of the green. Umm, not so fast, chachi. Courtney Love has been campaigning to make the realities known and soon she'll get a chance to <a href="http://www.sonicnet.com/news/story.jhtml?id=1447878">tell the California Senate</a>. A good example is the fact that record companies had the CA legislature exempt them and their contracts from a law that limits personal service contracts for entertainers (the kind that most record deals use) to only seven years.</p>
