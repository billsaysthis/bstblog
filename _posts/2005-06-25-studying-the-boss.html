<p><a href="http://monmouth.edu/">Monmouth University</a>, which back when I was in high school didn't put on such airs and was known as Monmouth College, is holding a symposium on Bruce Springsteen in September. Over 160 professors and such will spend several days presenting papers and discussing such thrillers as the influence of Joseph Conrad and Charles Dickens on the rocker's lyrics. Cool beans--I'm enough of a Springsteen dork that I'd probably go if I still lived in the area.</p>
<p>You'd think that the institution, also known less formally as Yale by the Wales, would be at least promoting the event on some notable place on its website but I'll be smacked if if I can find it anywhere. How many more high profile events can there be in the next three months? Good thing I can read about it on the <a href="http://www.press-citizen.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050624/NEWS01/506240309/1079/RSS01">Iowa City Press Citizen</a>!</p>
