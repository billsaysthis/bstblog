<p><b>And so did I</b></p>
<p><a href="/poetry/poetryhome.phtml?poemname=and_so_did_i.html">09 Sep 01</a></p>
<p>You had six months of affection<br />
<br />Flowers and phone calls<br />
<br />Kisses, dinners, happiness<br />
<br />And so did I</p>
<p>The white hot blaze burned us<br />
<br />Touched us with the magic wand<br />
<br />Then you questioned happiness<br />
<br />And so did I</p>
<p>We ran an amazing race together<br />
<br />Almost making the finish line<br />
<br />You hesitated and stumbled<br />
<br />And so did I</p>
<p>The passion had us running<br />
<br />The days and nights blurring<br />
<br />You lost the magic ring<br />
<br />And so did I</p>
<p>We bounced and bounded together<br />
<br />Climbing the hills of love<br />
<br />You fell down and broke your crown<br />
<br />And so did I</p>
<p>I gave you my heart too easily<br />
<br />Then took it away too soon<br />
<br />Remember the beauty of the fire<br />
<br />And so will I</p>
