<p><b>Techies can have a sense of humor too!</b><br />

<p>And I'm not just talking about <a href="http://www.sev.com.au/toonzone/sevtrek.asp">SevTrek</a>. Bill Nottingham of Red Hat <a href="http://lwn.net/daily/roswell.php3">posted a message</a> that denies the existence of a new beta:</p>
<p>"It has come to our attention that rumors are floating regarding the appearance of a Red Hat Linux beta release, named ROSWELL. We would like to reassure you that there is nothing of the sort."</p>
<p>He then goes on to list the major features, place to file bug reports, and place to get the docs, as well as a list of mirror locations to download the 2.5 gigabytes of software. He ends with</p>
<p>"However, there is no evidence to suggest the actual presence of a ROSWELL beta release. Those who claim otherwise would best not flaunt their naivete by telling anyone that they saw anything other than Rawhide."</p>
<p>I love a good laugh.</p>
