<p>The last sight I saw was a massive flame<br />
<br />Amazingly bright yellows, oranges, and reds<br />
<br />When all too soon black squeezed in at the edges.</p>
<p>Then there was no more color I could see<br />
<br />Though the sound came louder and louder<br />
<br />Waves crashing in, crowding in, painful.</p>
<p>Heat pushed up against my body, shoving<br />
<br />Making my skin turn and twist<br />
<br />Turn colors I could no longer see for the black.</p>
<p>My friend Paula was standing next to me a moment before<br />
<br />Then she struck me with force that sent us tumbling<br />
<br />Agony running through me as I hit pavement.</p>
<p>Barely heard, she whimpered; barely understood "Goodbye!"<br />
<br />I made to say same to her but my lips<br />
<br />Melted too quickly from the onslaught.</p>
<p>Pain, all that was left to me, no other sense<br />
<br />Than this semblance of touch, undesired<br />
<br />Raging through my body, all that I can feel.</p>
<p>Where did the bright yellows and the crushing sound<br />
<br />And the overwhelming heat and PAIN come from?<br />
<br />GOODBYE GOODBYE goodbye.</p>
