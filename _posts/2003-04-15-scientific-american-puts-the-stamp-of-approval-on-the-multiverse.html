<p>Just the other day <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_04_06_blog_archive.phtml#200137911">I commented</a> on astrophysicist Paul Davies and his <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/12/opinion/12DAVI.html">religion-driven attack</a> on this scientific concept. So what do I find today on <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/04/14/238217&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=160">/.</a> but a link to Scientific American's current issue cover story, <a href="http://www.sciam.com/print_version.cfm?articleID=000F1EDD-B48A-1E90-8EA5809EC5880000">Parallel Universes</a>.</p>
<p>Author Max Tegmark: "One of the many implications of recent cosmological observations is that the concept of parallel universes is no mere metaphor. Space appears to be infinite in size. If so, then somewhere out there, everything that is possible becomes real, no matter how improbable it is. Beyond the range of our telescopes are other regions of space that are identical to ours. Those regions are a type of parallel universe. Scientists can even calculate how distant these universes are, on average."</p>
<p>Tegmark's credentials: professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania, an expert in analyzing the cosmic microwave background and galaxy clustering, and much of his work bears on the concept of parallel universes. So when you hear someone babbling on about "Intelligent Design", just say no.</p>
