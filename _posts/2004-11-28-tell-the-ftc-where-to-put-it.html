<p>Using their <a href="https://secure.commentworks.com/ftc-tsr/">Comment Form</a>, I told the FTC just what I thought about a proposed rule change regarding telemarketing in the US. I included "Private Information Stays So Organized for Freedom" as the Organization Name on their form, feel free to claim your membership in PISSOFF as well. Details on this new stupidity, maybe cupidity is a better name are in this <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-fone27.html">Sun-Times article</a> and the <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/11/27/2216200&amp;from=rss">Slashdot discussion</a>.</p>
<p>I told them, short and sweet: "This is an absurd rules change that completely ignores the overwhelming existing public response to telemarketing and the Do Not Call registry. Further, if this really did mean more jobs for Americans we might be able to justify some such change but because nearly all call centers are now located in other nations this argument holds no water."</p>
