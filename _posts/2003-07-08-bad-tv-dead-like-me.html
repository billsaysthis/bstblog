<p>Unlike archrival network HBO, Showtime just doesn't seem to have the executive talent necessary to make good series. Other than <em>Jeremiah</em>, I can't really think of one series they've put on that has been worth watching every week. Still, I'm a sucker for punishment and so I tuned into their latest offering, <a href="http://www.sho.com/deadlikeme/">Dead Like Me</a>.</p>
<p>This show is populated by five regulars, people who've died but not yet passed on to the next plane of existence. Such people are given no choice but to work as Grim Reapers, this group based in Seattle, responsible for separating our souls from our bodies just at the time of death. The reapers do their job by touching a person. If they don't perform their assigned tasks, which they get via a (so far) mysterious list dropped under the leader's door each morning, the 'client' suffers a terrible consequence. After sufficient service, the reapers are allowed to ascend, though in their undead existence no knowledge of that place is permitted.</p>
<p>The show's lead is Georgia 'George' Lass (Ellen Muth), an 18 year old girl who's killed by a toilet fallen off a space shuttle. Her boss is Rube, no last name, is played by Mandy Patinkin and in the first three episodes we've not been given a clue about who he is. Rebecca Gayeheart, Jasmine Guy, and Callum Blue play the other undead, while George's parents and younger sister show up each episode so far still dealing with her departure.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I just don't care about George and her struggle to accept the new rules of existence she's been given. Patinkin is a really good actor, which is more than I can say for the rest of this crew, but he's not being given anything to work with. And the series' basic concept is just beyond my ability to suspend my disbelief. We have this whole complex structure of existence and some type of afterlife but the transition can't be made without the soothing touch of a Reaper?</p>
<p>There's more that's wrong with <em>Dead Like Me</em> but it's just not worth writing up. Give it a skip.</p>
<p>As for that one good show, <a href="http://www.sho.com/jeremiah/">Jeremiah</a> was renewed for a second season but even though more than half a year has passed since the announcement, no air date has yet been set. Way to go, Showtime execs, way to keep what little audience you have in the loop. I mean, it's been more than a year since the last episode has aired and you haven't even unspooled a preparatory repeat run.</p>
<p><em>Not recommended</em></p>
