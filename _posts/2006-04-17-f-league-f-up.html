<p>I've been doing fairly well again this season in the SpoFi EPL Fantasy League, standing fourth after Sunday's matches, but screwed up last night. Easter means the teams squeeze in an extra match in the first part of the week and so a new fantasy league round covered the games played today, tomorrow and Wednesday, or at least most do. Arsenal doesn't, since they meet Villareal of La Liga Wednesday in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final; also off are Liverpool and the teams they meet, Fulham and Manchester City.</p>
<p>I didn't realize all this until after dinner last night while checking the standings. I had three Arsenal players and so I made two transfers (no way was I giving up Thierry Henry), looking to take most advantage of the remaining four rounds. This morning I saw a few scores, such as <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/match?id=185984&amp;cc=5901">Chelsea walloping Everton</a>, and thought to my self, "Self, you did remember to make Lampard captain, right?" Captains get their points doubled.</p>
<p>Of course, self did <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> remember to switch the captaincy from Henry to Lampard. Thereby wasting at least 11 points, and possibly 14 once bonuses are awarded. Henry will need to go on a tear the last few games to make it up to me.</p>
