<p>If you were thinking of making time this weekend to come look over Casa de Lazar with an eye towards buyin', I have some bad news for ya. That's good news for me and the Sweet One, of course. We got a contract on the place yesterday--now we have to find the next rest stop. Saw a couple of places after work that fill the bill. Thanks for the positive wishes, Karl and Garret.</p>
