<p><a href="http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=orbitz_blows">The most expensive $94 Orbitz will ever make.</a> Maddox, well you either <a href="http://www.friendsofmaddox.com/vbull/archive/index.php/">love</a> or <a href="http://www.ninjapirate.com/posers.html">hate</a> his style and he's been posting rants to the web <a href="http://maddox.xmission.com/c.cgi?u=archive">longer than blogs have existed</a> (hey, not that his site is a blog, just sayin'), but in his latest posting he gives us a great lesson in how our little websites can cost big companies plenty of business. We can hardly verify the stories in the emails he's posting but there must be enough people sending his message to Orbitz that the travel site has written a form response to them. That $94 of his they hung on to, well, you have to figure Orbitz has spent a heck of a lot more just for the staff time to respond to his and his readers' emails and to come up with this custom response.</p>
<p>Scoble, this seems like something you and Shel might want to investigate <a href="http://redcouch.typepad.com/weblog/">for your book</a>. How can companies respond when customer issues have exploded on a widely-read website to minimize damage or even turn it around, especially when the writer is not generally known for being easy to deal with?</p>
