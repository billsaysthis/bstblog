<p><strong>Friday's movie: Spy Game</strong></p>
<p>Robert Redford rules in <a href="http://www.thespygame.net/">this movie</a>, without a question, and for about the first time I recall, Brad Pitt actully does a creditable job of acting. I walked out of Spy Game laughing hard over how the clearly aging (64 years old!) Redford played the CIA assholes who for whatever reason were glad to see the last of him (the movie takes place on his last day working). If I had to pick one, the lack of any explanation or backstory for the animosity between Redford and Stephen Dillane (playing Charles Harker) would be my choice as biggest shortcoming of the film. The film uses Pitt's current predicament and the play of power politics as the background to show us how Redford recruited Pitt into the CIA at the end of the Vietnam War, made him into a top agent, then blew up their relationship. Lots of explosions and bullets but good character development, cinematography, and pacing. The quality isn't surprising to me, since Tony Ridley directed; his past films include Crimson Tide, Enemy of the People, and Last Boy Scout. Highly recommended.</p>
