<p>This page will surely be daypopped and blogdexed and probably even /.'ed but so what. <a href="http://www.bigbluesmoke.com/">Big Blue Smoke - Truth is greater than fiction, but not as funny.</a> This is a Sun Microsystems web site that pokes fun at IBM. Not only fake news stories but movie listings and a version of Tetris which is impossible to win. Nice to see a company using humor against a competitor and not fearing huge litigation.</p>
