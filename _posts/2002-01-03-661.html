<p><strong>Consideration: gone the way of the dodo</strong></p>
<p>People have complained that we are no longer willing to make any effort to minimize the impact of our actions on each other. This has become so embedded in our conciousness that Hollywood has made a <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/changing_lanes.html">big budget film</a> about the consequences of a fender bender (although I have to say that from the linked trailer the film probably will suck). Even in my own neighborhood I saw a prime example of it, a moving van sticking out of a driveway and blocking half of the street even though the truck could have been backed up a few more feet with no problem:</p>
