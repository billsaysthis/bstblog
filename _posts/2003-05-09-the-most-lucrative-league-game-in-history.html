<p>English Premier League, that is. A single match, last of the season, on Sunday will determine whether my beloved Liverpool FC or the <a href="http://www.sportsfilter.com/comments.cfm/1528#10649">brummy bog bandits</a> of Chelsea will finish fourth and thereby clinch the final English spot in next season's  Champions League. LFC must win outright to end up alright while Chelsea takes it with only a draw. And this is hugely meaningful because the financial difference between the CL place and the consolation prize of UEFA Cup is <a href="http://football.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,9753,952584,00.html">Â£20m-plus</a>! That's more than $32 million American. History may be against us, not having when at Stamford Bridge in 13 years, but I predict the Reds will make me a wedding present and win.</p>
