<p>R to the n, where r stands for romance<br />
<br />And n for the imaginary number of love<br />
<br />Gives us an understanding of feelings<br />
<br />That connect us to each other in real time.</p>
<p>Imaginary or infinite, lust makes us grind<br />
<br />Our teeth, upper against lower, for hours<br />
<br />Without even realizing the force expressed<br />
<br />By our painful grimaces, to each other.</p>
<p>Transitively reflecting the momentum<br />
<br />Or the velocity of my affection for you<br />
<br />Against a mirror held up with little more<br />
<br />Than sweetness and the light in your eyes.</p>
<p>Take the intersection of the product above<br />
<br />With the far from quotidian embraces shared<br />
<br />Until you reach the wonderful asymptotic line<br />
<br />Where there is zero distance between our hearts.</p>
