<li>Karl: I <del>swiped</del> reused the post title from this disappointed, heavily involved Philly rocker--<a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/weblog/kmartino/archives/003536.shtml">Morning report</a>--and especially recommend to you his 10 point checklist at the end of this post. For #2 I think that we need to find a way to express ethics and morality without tieing them so closely to (a specific) religion.</li>
<li>TalkingPointsMemo: <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_10_31.php#003927">Don't forget the 10 Year Plan</a> to build a Democratic infrastructure to compete at all levels, if we aren't too late. Will the second term see widespread visible suppression of our First Amendment rights in the name of national security? Don't count on the Supreme Court to protect us, not unless the Bush Crew makes the kind of mistake Eisenhower did with <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/people/A0851493.html">Earl Warren</a>, and I'm sure in this age of utter scrutiny that's just not going to happen.<br />
  </li>
<li>Dan Gillmore: <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/010986.shtml">Four More Years</a> asks, as Karl does, where did the center go? How did the Republicans convince so many people to vote against their own economic interests? Especially since Bush comes across to so many of us non-supporters as more talking the talk than walking the walk on the values that supposedly won those votes.</li>
<li>Andrew Sullivan: <a href="http://www.andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2004_10_31_dish_archive.html#109949699774587765">Demonizing gays</a> was a (terribly sad, IMO) tactic used in many states but I hear a little voice saying it could end up backfiring if Bush continues to largely ignore the social issues legislatively in favor of War and Corpocracy (two sides of the same coin).<br />
  </li>
<li>Kristof: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/03/opinion/03kris.html?ex=1257224400&amp;en=5341e127321c2a04&amp;amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">Living Poor, Voting Rich</a> has a key point, that "the Democratic Party's first priority should be to reconnect with the American heartland." Goes back to Karl's list.</li>
<li>Doc: <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2004/11/03#leftField">The people spoke</a>, he says, but I wonder about Diebold, Sequoya and ESS in ways that can never be proven.</li>
<li>Garret: <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/?p=5134">How this Democrat is feeling at the moment</a> is flat on his back in the middle of the road waiting to be run over.</li>
<li>Matt: <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/AWholeLottaNothing?m=31">Stages</a>, I can't see most of the people on our side considering the second stage. We have nothing to bargain with except maybe Senate filibusters and Bill Bennett, telegraphing the Administration's view of the 51-48popular vote split as an overwhelming madate, is already calling for a decimation of the secular Left. </li>
</ul>
<p>Oh what a beautiful morning indeed!<br /></p>
