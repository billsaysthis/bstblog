<p>Tivo can be a great and wonderful toy, no doubt. But it can also be a pain in the ass. I set the machine to record this morning's opening World Cup match and instead of changing the channel to 38 for ESPN2, the piece of crap changed it to 3. Sometimes it drops off the last number for some unknown reason. And yes, I already made the aluminum foil fort over the IR receivers. So I miss a huge match, with <a href="http://worldcup.espnsoccernet.com/report?match=46457&amp;lang=en">Senegal upsetting France 1-0</a>. I set up a Season Pass for the World Cup matches and let's just say this better not happen again because I can't be staying up all night to watch. Damn!</p>
