<p>For quite some time I've wanted my <a href="http://commadot.com">former co-worker</a> to speak to <a href="http://jhtc.org">JHTC</a> and now he's agreed to be at our March 10 meeting.  The title of his talk is "Drive Product Success with User Experience" and I'm disappointed in not coming up with a better one but to be blunt Glen is a UX god, absolutely worth your time to come hear.</p>
<p>Glen is someone who can cut through any discussion to find the real decision points and turn that into product requirements and visual design. His blog post today, <a href="http://commadot.com/what-are-you-arguing-about/">What are you arguing about?</a>, is a perfect example of his ability to convert argument (in a rhetorical sense) into answerable questions.</p>
<p>One his pithy principles that I love is Who's the landlord? What he means is every product feature, design aspect or word on a page or screen has to carry its weight. Nothing "just gets" in without contributing to the end goal, which is (in his case) building lovely software, software whose customers say "I love this and have to have it."</p>
<p>See for yourself March 10!</p>
