<p>A quality win, though a bit high scoring, as <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/12/19/1040174345131.html">Liverpool makes it to semis</a> in the League Cup by beating Aston Villa 4-3 at Aston Villa when Danny Murphy hit the net in injury time. The Reds will face Sheffield United, a team popping it's head up from the First Division, in the semi-finals while top-rank teams Manchester United and Blackburn Rovers meet in the other match. Seems like the boys may have a decent chance for at least one title this season. Sad as it is to say, I find it hard to imagine they'll be able to make up the gap with Arsenal in the Premiership.</p>
