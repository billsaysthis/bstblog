<p>Talk about irony! We go to see a film about folk singers and then after, in search of some evening java, end up at a coffeeshop where a folksinger is playing. Funny or what?</p>
<p>Which fits in perfectly with <a href="http://amightywindonline.warnerbros.com/index.php">A Mighty Wind</a>, the latest film from Christopher Guest, Eugene Levy, and gang. Guest was also responsible for (co-wrote and directed) recent intelligent humor outings <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_06_10_blog_archive.phtml#4008034">Best in Show</a> and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0118111">Waiting for Guffman</a>; he first came to attention with a year on <i>Saturday Night Live</i> back in the '80s but really as bassist <a href="http://us.imdb.com/EGallery?source=ss&amp;group=0088258&amp;photo=Ss/0088258/1&amp;path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Guest,%20Christopher">Nigel Tufnel</a> in <a href="http://www.spinaltap.com/">This is Spinal Tap</a> (compare that Tufnel pic to <a href="http://us.imdb.com/EGallery?source=ss&amp;group=0310281&amp;photo=Ss/0310281/mighty.jpg&amp;path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Guest,%20Christopher">this still</a> from <em>Wind</em>).</p>
<p>This movie tells the story of a memorial tribute concert for Irving Steinbloom, recently deceased and the number one impresario of the folk music scene of the late 1950s and '60s, and the three groups that come together for it. In two weeks with Public Broadcasting televising it live, no less. The Spinal Tap trio (Guest, Harry Shearer, and Michael McKean) make up The Folksmen, who for unstated reasons haven't seen each other in 30 years. Catherine O'Hara and Levy are Mitch and Mickey, who also haven't seen each other in 30 years either but because Mitch went insane. The last group is The New Main Street Singers, a nine piece ensemble though none of the nine are actually original members or even close to old enough to have been one.</p>
<p>The script, by Guest and Levy, had plenty of jokes in it, which is hardly surprising but <em>Wind</em> also has a lot more <strike>subtle</strike>situational humor. Some instances: Shearer's bald head and under the chin beard; the former porn actress turned New Main Street singer (the terrific <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Lynch,%20Jane">Jane Lynch</a>, who played the lesbian lover in <i>Best in Show</i>) and her utterly fantastic cosmological explanation; Ed Begley Jr.'s public broadcasting honcho, a native of Sweden who peppers his speech with Yiddish; Fred Willard's character, who is completely oblivious to reality yet able to operate successfully for decades in the entertainment business when in any other industry he'd be lucky to have a job packing up return shipments.</p>
<p>There is quite a bit of folk music throughout the 90 minute movie, which is a problem for some people, but even with this the filmmakers have gone to the trouble of writing songs that fit the period perfectly while effectively parodying the originals. The movie title is also the name of the closing song, performed together by three groups, but also a, well, jocular reference to a big fart. Plot, as usual for this group, is mostly ignored in favor of sketches but there is progress towards the concert as well as hiccups along the way and I think that any more plot would have just gotten in the way.</p>
<p><em>Definitely recommended</em></p>
