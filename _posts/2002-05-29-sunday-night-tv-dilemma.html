<p>What to do? What to do! The TV season may be over but you wouldn't know it to look at the schedule for this coming Sunday night at 9:00. For starters, the season finale of <a href="http://www.hbo.com/sixfeetunder/">Six Feet Under</a>. After being turned off by the first few episodes of the first season, I started watching and now it's good, really good. TNT has an original movie starring Patrick Stewart, <a href="http://tvlistings2.zap2it.com/progdetails.asp?prog_id=2199629">King of Texas</a>, which fortunately will be repeating numerous times; don't you want to see Captain Picard play Shakespeare as a Texas rancher?. The Tonys are on too but I don't really care, do you?</p>
<p>Here's the dilemma: ABC is premiering <a href="http://abc.abcnews.go.com/primetime/thehamptons/index.html">The Hamptons</a> and Fox <a href="http://tvlistings2.zap2it.com/progdetails.asp?prog_id=2201153">Looking for Love: Bachelorettes in Alaska</a>. How can I miss out on such intense, dramatic reality programming? Just because I think Survivor sucks, Fear Factor farts, and Temptation Island blows.</p>
<p>With Tivo I can record only one show at a time and I can watch another on the other set. What's a poor boy to do? Actually, I think I'll just be watching Six Feet Under. Reality shows can bite my shorts, to paraphrase another Sunday night TV hero.</p>
<p><strong>Serious programming note:</strong> At 10 make sure to watch the new HBO series <a href="http://www.hbo.com/thewire">The Wire</a> which <a href="http://tvguide.com/magazine/issues/020527/roush.asp">Matt Roush says</a> is even better than Six Feet Under. Another David Simon (Homicide, The Corner) Baltimore cops and criminals show.</p>
