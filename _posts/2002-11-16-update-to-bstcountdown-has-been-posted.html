<p>Thanks to Nelson Weiderman, a fellow curmudgeon, a minor annoyance in the PHP class that I posted to the PHP Classes Repository has been resolved. The class didn't really handle the last day before an event very well and now it does. Get the <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/browse.html/package/805.html">new version</a> and rejoice! (Actually you only need <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/goto/browse.html/file/2664.html">one file</a>.)</p>
