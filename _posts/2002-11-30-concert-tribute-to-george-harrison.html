<p>Yesterday was the one year anniversary of George's death from cancer and a few of his good friends got together to put on a <a href="http://www.allthingsmustpass.com/concert/index.html">tribute to him and his music</a> last night at the Royal Albert Hall in London. I'm sure it was an amazing experience. McCartney, Starr, Clapton, Petty, Billy Preston, Jeff Lynne, and George's son Dhanni played Harrison's songs after Ravi Shankar and his daughter Anoushka opened with a performance by a 50 member orchestra including a special piece composed by Shankar especially for the evening. Most of the living members of Monty Python, whose films were financed by Harrison, came on to sing the classics <em>Sit on My Face</em> &amp; <em>The Lumberjack Song</em>. Fortunately the show was recorded and a DVD, with proceeds going to his Material World Foundation, will be released.</p>
<p>Plenty of fans <a href="http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/news/911georgeallstartribute.html">attended</a> the show and <a href="http://www.archervalerie.com/geotribute.html">posted</a> their thoughts to the web already, for more details on the show itself.  The official website has a short but well made video online with some bits from the rehearsals and comments from the musicians. I would love to have been there but there's a continent, an ocean, and too long a stretch of unemployment that got in my way.</p>
<p>There was also a <a href="http://arrowfm.com/grapevine/stories/11-19harrison.shtml">flower vigil</a> on Hollywood Blvd. yesterday comemorating Harrison.</p>
