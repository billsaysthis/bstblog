<p>I was out and about this afternoon, enjoying the beautiful weather that is one of the major reasons I had for moving here six years ago. Actually I was out to see the doctor about the pain my hands, which is apparently caused by compressed ulnar nerves and can be corrected easily (phew!). But still, here we are in late February and the Sun is shining and the sky is blue and I can be comfortable in a shortsleeve shirt. Such a contrast from the last few winters I had in New Jersey before moving here.</p>
<p>I come home, though, to find this rather unpleasant story in my inbox courtesy of a buddy who recently had twin boys: <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/muller020702.asp">Springtime, Taxes, and the Attack on Iraq</a>. For better or worse, the author has way to much credibility to easily dismiss so regardless of the general pronouncements that nothing will happen soon with Iraq one has to be ready. Not my idea of a beautiful spring day but perhaps necessary nonetheless.</p>
