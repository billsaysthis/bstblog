<p><b>Fans take on their own Star Trek series</b><br />

<p>SyFy Portal is reporting that a group of fans are <a href="http://www.syfyportal.com/article/?id=59">producing their own Star Trek series</a>, at least in the form of original scripts, graphics, and some audio and video. <a href="www.startrekrenaissance.com">Star Trek: Renaissance</a> begins in 2401, 25 years after the Federation-Dominion war ended, is set on a new Enterprise (1701-G), features a new crew, hopes to combine the best of Star Trek: Deep Space 9 with <a href="http://www.celestis.com/01bios/rodbry.html">Gene Roddenberry's</a> original Trek vision. The episodes will be released weekly beginning on Sep. 8 (35 years to the day after the original series premiered) and the producers plan seven seasons with 26 episodes per season, just like the TV series. Note that this effort is completely independent of the <a href="www.startrek.com">offical Star Trek</a> program at <a href="http://www.paramount.com/">Paramount</a>.</p>
<p>As an aside, here is a <a href="http://www.williamcooper.com/majestyt.htm">weird piece</a> connecting Star Trek to a demonic Illuminati/Masonic conspiracy to take over the world.</p>
