<p>I concede that you are not a terrorist<br />
<br />That you are a man of passion<br />
<br />Who happens to enjoy the sight of fireballs.</p>
<p>In the long dark of when it was simply a match<br />
<br />That burned down to the last<br />
<br />You only shook your fingers in the breeze.</p>
<p>When by accident a whole book of them was lit<br />
<br />You smiled and dropped it on a line of ants<br />
<br />Smelling the sweetly acrid whisps of smoke.</p>
<p>School may have taught you maths and geography<br />
<br />History did more than teach of a past<br />
<br />Glorious but lost in the arms of a beast.</p>
<p>A lunch time brought word of rebellion<br />
<br />Arms against the beast and no reply is heard<br />
<br />So a match is sparked within your breast.</p>
<p>Consider the holy words, day after day<br />
<br />Consider the shame of being kept from the true path<br />
<br />Consider the shame of being kept from spreading the Word.</p>
<p>Then the flame inside is fanned, the smell of burning insects<br />
<br />The beast must be burned, let out the word<br />
<br />Let the Word be the burning spear as of old.</p>
<p>All who fail to tremble before you<br />
<br />Must burn in shame and burn to quench your thirst<br />
<br />To once again stand tall as you burn.</p>
