<p><strong>A crappy day in the NFL</strong></p>
<p>If you are a Bay Area or New Jersey football fan, it sure was. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/printerfriendly.jhtml?type=sportnews&amp;StoryID=484055">49ers, Raiders, Giants, and Jets all lost</a> winnable games. So the Giants are out of the playoffs, the Jets must win next week, the 49ers are likely to lose any chance at hosting a wildcard game, and the Raiders, who've played like crap for the last month, need a win next week to assure a first round bye. The Jets could have backed in with a Seattle loss today, but of course Flutie wasn't up to <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=211230024">that task</a>. And off course the Jets play the Raiders next week so both can't get what they want.</p>
