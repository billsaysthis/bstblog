<p>Got this as a throw in with the Olevia TV from Fry's and have no need for it. Would cost you $100 or more from what I can tell online or in a store but I'll let it go for $60. Cash or Bank Check/Cashier's Check only, no Paypal, personal checks or credit card, and you have to pick up from me in Mountain View or nearby.</p>

<p>A good post-holiday deal.</p>
<p>I'll ship it to you (only within the US or Canada) but you have to cover the cost of packaging and shipping and my bank must confirm that your bank/cashier check has cleared before I send it out. My estimate--ESTIMATE--is that shipping will cost a minimum of $15 for UPS Ground (5-7 day) delivery.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Update, two hours later:</span> Wow, that was fast! A nice man contacted me from the CL posting and we agreed to $50, I met him at the Mickey D's by 101, he gave me the cash I gave him the box and am home again. This is why people love Craig's List.</p>
