<p>Wade Horn, Asst. Secretary, Administration for Children and Families, Dept. of Health and Human Services, slings typical Bush Administration rhetorical crap in a letter to the <em>NY Times</em> titled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/23/opinion/l23kristof.html">Effective Sex Education</a>. While correctly stating that schoolchildren aren't harmed by including abstinence in sex education programs and that current implementation of such programs aren't 100% effective, Horn completely ignores the truth of his administration's program proposal: abstinence is the only method which educators should be allowed to teach. What a load, yet so many people buy off on each of these little pieces of the plan and dismiss objections such as mine without any real reason.</p>
