<p><strong>Skinematic Spotlight: The Lord of the Rings</strong></p>
<p>Just to show you that there's almost everything and anything on the Worldwide Web, here's a site from Vail Reese called skinema.com... The Dermatology in the Cinema web site. This week Reese shines his light on <a href="http://itsb.ucsf.edu/~vcr/Spot17LOTR.html">LotR</a> in quite a bit of detail. Let's just say he finds a lot to write about. He will even cut on some extremely <a href="http://itsb.ucsf.edu/~vcr/CskinLeonorVarela.html">hot women</a>, does this doctor have no scruples?</p>
