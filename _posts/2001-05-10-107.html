<p><b>Sounds crazy but--the Ewing Theory</b>
<p>Bill Simmons has <a href="http://espn.go.com/page2/s/simmons/010509.html">written up a wacky idea</a> he and a friend came up with, which they call they Ewing Theory. In a nutshell, it goes: 
<ol />
<li>"A star athlete receives an inordinate amount of media attention and fan interest, and yet his teams never win anything substantial with him (other than maybe some early-round playoff series). 
<li>That same athlete leaves his team (either by injury, trade, graduation, free agency or retirement) -- and both the media and fans immediately write off the team for the following season.</p>
<p>When those elements collide, you have the Ewing Theory." The column goes into detail on examples, possible future cases, and applicability to the world of entertainment. Cool!</li>
