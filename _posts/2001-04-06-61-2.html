<p><b>from the Bad Joke Dept.</b>
<p>This is very unusual for me. I'm not generally inclined to pass on unproven  financial advice. But yesterday, I heard from a drug rep for Glaxo who told me that they are on the verge of launching a new herbal remedy that they think will take the market by storm. This drug sounds so promising that I want to suggest to my friends and family that they consider buying stock in the company. The drug is called "Ginko Viagra," and its function is to help you remember what the fuck you are doing.</p>
<p>Borrowed from the <a href="http://www.16thstreet.net/blog/index.php3">haha - no, serious</a> weblog.</p>
