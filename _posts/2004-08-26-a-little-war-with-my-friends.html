<p>(A little something that occured to me with the RNC coming so soon, to the tune of The Beatles' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_a_Little_Help_from_My_Friends">With a Little Help from My Friends</a>)</p>
<p>A little help from my friends<br />
<br />What would you think if I invaded Iraq,<br />
<br />Would you stand up and walk out on me?<br />
<br />Lend me your guns and I'll tell you a lie,<br />
<br />And I'll try not to make you feel sick.</p>
<p>I get by with a little help from my friends,<br />
<br />I can lie with a little help from my friends,<br />
<br />Going to try a little war with my friends.</p>
<p>What do I do when allies go astray?<br />
<br />(Doesn't worry me to be alone)<br />
<br />How do I feel by the end of the day?<br />
<br />(I'm not sad because I'm on my own)</p>
<p>No I get by with a little help from my friends.<br />
<br />Do you need anybody?<br />
<br />I don't need no one to go.<br />
<br />Could it be anybody?<br />
<br />I want somebody to fight.</p>
<p>Would you believe in a lie at first sight?<br />
<br />Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time.<br />
<br />What do you see when you turn out the light?<br />
<br />I can't tell you, but I know that it's mine.</p>
<p>Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,<br />
<br />Do you need anybody?<br />
<br />I just need somebody to invade,<br />
<br />Could it be anybody?<br />
<br />I want someone to invade.</p>
<p>I get by with a little help from my friends,<br />
<br />Yes I get by with a little war with my friends,<br />
<br />With a little help from my friends.<br /></p>
