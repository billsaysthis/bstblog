<p>So, I haven't written too much here this week, though did have <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2005_03_06_blog_archive.phtml#111024462338277622">a little Haiku battle</a> with Garret that was amusing. Not intentionally slacking as some potential work-related things came up, more on that later, and I chose to spend more time reading a couple of <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2005_03_06_blog_archive.phtml#111043336054668043">actual</a> physical <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/fiction/faq.html" title="Singularity Sky">books</a>. Also, the weather has been just gorgeous, mid-70s up into the 80s and clear skies; after so much rain and grey skies this is tough to concentrate on writing.</p>
<p>Now I'm going back to my book, at least until Stargate SG-1 comes on. LOL!</p>
