<p>We're asking the developer community for their input on the Aptana Studio... what you like, what you hate, and do you want. Per the survey page:<br />
<blockquote>We want to make Aptana Studio better for YOU. To do that, we need to understand what you do, how you work, what you like about Studio, and what drives you nuts. Whether you're a regular Studio user or you've only tried it once or twice, we want to know what's working for you and what's not, what features you can't find, and what features you can't live without.</p>
<p>From now until January 10, you can help us determine our direction for the next year and beyond by taking a few minutes to give us your thoughts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Please take a few minutes and <a href="http://www.aptana.com/roadmap/2009/survey1">give us your thoughts</a>!</p>
