<p>Another epistle after reading <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/30/international/worldspecial4/30prexy.html">News Analysis: Diplomacy: It's About Aid, and an Image</a> in today's <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span>:</p>
<p>In response to the horrific tragedy of Sunday's Asian Tsunami and the need to bring substantive resources to bear for the area's recovery, a simple suggestion of where many millions of additional dollars are to be found: President Bush's inaugural celebration. Estimates forecast over $35 million will be spent on this event, and I doubt that total includes the money spent on travel and food by the thousands in attendance. To show solidarity and care, cancel the vast majority of the events and travel and donate that money instead.</p>
