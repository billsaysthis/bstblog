<p>I really can't tell, either by reading the essay or by perusing the remainder of the website, whether <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/pages/globalmindcontrol.html">Global Mind Control Slated For Humanity By 2004</a> is serious or a parody. Rev. Terry-ana Robinson, MC (where MC apparently means Melchizedek Cloister) writes of a terrible plot against humanity by a group of humans conspiring, and interbreeding, with aliens. Her methods for developing immunity to this bioweapon, though, is simply to become closer to the God or Higher Power in which you believe, eat a healthy diet, exercise, open your mind/rid yourself of dogmatic, unthinking beliefs, and learn new things. Doesn't this sound like a pretty basic way in which you mainly live already? [Weirdness <em>via <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com">garret</a></em>]</p>
