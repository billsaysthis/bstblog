<p><b>A Tolkien Encyclopedia</b><br />

<p>J.R.R. Tolkien's tales of hobbits, elves, and other fantastical creatures have been pop culture mainstays since the 1960s and are finally coming to the <a href="http://lordoftherings.net/">big screen</a> beginning in December. Mark Fisher, in a labor of love, is creating a beautiful, detailed <a href="http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/default.htm">Encyclopedia of Arda</a> as possibly the ultimate reference to this masterwork of fantasy.</p>
<p>Related: Ranjit Matthew <a href="http://ranjitmathew.tripod.com/phartz/intranet/index.html">wrote up his recent effort</a> to set up an intranet using open source software in the guise of Samwise Gamgee working for Frodo Baggins at Hobbitware.com. There is no mention of why Matthew uses this 'literary' device nor does it particularly add or detract from the tutorial nature of the article.</p>
<p>And for laughs, the folks behind <a href="http://www.sev.com.au/toonzone/sevtrek/strip.asp">SevTrek</a> are doing it <a href="http://www.sev.com.au/toonzone/fotr/strip.asp">cartoon fashion</a> featuring Fraudo and Gonedaft the Grey.</p>
