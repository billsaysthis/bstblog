<li>Novelist Jane Smiley: Red Staters <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2109218/">are willfully ignorant</a> and the answer is not to move right or left but to pound them over the head with Bush Crew mistakes and outrages. Hmm.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.johnkerryisadouchebagbutimvotingforhimanyway.com/">For my homie, America</a></li>
<li>What will voters think if we are still at war against terror four years from now, if Osama bin Laden or Zarqawi is still videotaping the occasional taunting message? I'm hardpressed to find exit polling to back this up but I have to think that somewhere between 5-10% of Bush's votes were won on the <span style="font-style:italic;">don't change horses in war time</span> reasoning, which was enough to swing the election. If Iraq is semi-stable, real democracy or not, but there are still Islamist terrorists killing people and disrupting economies regularly, will that argument work again?<br />
  </li>
<li>Not explicitly about the US or the election but an editorial in today's Times on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/05/opinion/05fri2.html?ex=1257397200&amp;en=e2af023836d03d92&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">murder of Theo Van Gogh</a> by Muslim extremists in the Netherlands raises the issue of managing diverse, even extreme, groups in a multiculural society. Seems applicable to the US as well because I find little difficulty in imagining Red/Blue conflict finding its way to violence in the near term, and not necessarily from the Red side--there are already groups and individuals on the Left here using such abominable tactics. I'd surely love to see the Times editorial board propose some concrete actions that might help solve the problem, or at least start down the path to solution, rather than just taking the easy way out as they have.</li>
<li>We're already seeing Hillary Clinton, Al Gore and John Edwards mentioned as early/potential frontrunners for the Dems in 2008 but with no incumbent VP to take the nod (and a Constitutional Amendment that would allow Schwarzenneger to run that soon nearly impossible), who are the likely Republican prospects?<br />
  </li>
</ul>
