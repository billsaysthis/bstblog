<p>Will be spent together. The <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/vivroar/blogger.html">Sweet One</a> moved in for good as of last night. Am I excited? Yes. Am I happy? Immensely. Do I love her? Forever? You bet! She is caring, intelligent, considerate, beautiful, sexy, loving, and the rest of you guys just lost out. Woohoo!</p>
