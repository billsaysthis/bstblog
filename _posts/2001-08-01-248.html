<p><b>Lance Armstrong for President</b><br />

<p>What? Winning the Tour De France three times in a row in dominating fashion--the third and fourth fastest times in the 88 year history of the race the past two years--isn't enough qualification? George W. drank his way through his 20s and 30s and look at him go now.
