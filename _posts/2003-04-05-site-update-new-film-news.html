<p>The latest addition to the site is in the Leisure section at left: <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/entertain//newfilmnews.phtml">New Film News</a>. The page shows the additions to my film release news database made in the last 30 days, which is something I've wanted to have for awhile and now that I have the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_03_23_blog_archive.phtml#200050016">New PHP movie page code</a> in place was a real piece of cake--just eight lines of code. I still want to write a custom data entry screen for this stuff and dump the <a href="http://phpmyedit.org/home.php">PHPMyEdit</a>-generated script but I hope that will not be too far in the future</p>
