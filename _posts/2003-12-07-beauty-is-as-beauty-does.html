<p>Miss World 2003 has some gorgeous <a href="http://www.missworld.org/contestants.asp?item=79&amp;page=1" title="Miss Brazil has incredible eyes!">contestants</a> and a <a href="http://www.missworld.org/contestants.asp?item=118&amp;page=4">lovely winner</a> but a completely <a href="http://www.missworld.org/">crappy website</a> that looks like only one page from the front but with more if you only <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22miss+world%22+%2Bcontestants">Google</a> them. Seems like some webmaster made a big booboo on the front page!</p>
