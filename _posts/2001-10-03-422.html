<p><b>Waiting, I hate waiting</b></p>
<p>Just sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring, somebody calling back with a piece of information. But I need to go out, tick tock tick tock, getting anxious. Uggh, cannot wait call back. Sit on hold, wait wait wait. Finally, situation is cleared. Give me my coffee!!!</p>
