<p>Regardless of where either sex comes from makes no difference in the end. We've all known for a long time that men are pigs, dirt, whatever scum-like form of life appeals to your taste; hell, even I recognized this early in life and said as much to my sister when I was 16 and she had just started dating. But the revelation is that women are no different!</p>
<p>You all probably remember that I met the Sweet One after conversations in a chat room. And though I no longer frequent it, I still get the associated emails. Much to my surprise, I read one yesterday from one of the female regulars decrying the fact that she had zero true female friends--because every time she meets a nice guy, one of her girlfriends ends up sleeping with him! ROFL, as we say in the 'room! All these years I'm thinking that (most, though not all) women are a step above men when it comes to classy sexual behavior and I was just wrong. <em>Bummer</em>.</p>
