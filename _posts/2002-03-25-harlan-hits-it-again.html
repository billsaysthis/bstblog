<p>Props to my high school friend Harlan Coben for hitting the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/31/books/bestseller/31bestpaperfiction.html">NY Times Paperback Fiction Bestseller List</a> for his new in paper (I of course bought it when the hardcover came out last year) mystery novel <a href="http://www.harlancoben.com/excerpts/TNO_excerpt.shtml">Tell No One</a>. This novel is a serious one, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_08_19_blog_archive.phtml#5197562">excellent</a> and a big change of pace from Harlan's first seven novels, which were all comic mysteries focused on college basketball superstar/lawyer/FBI agent/sports agent/detective Myron Bolitar. Who was also a fantasized alter ego for Coben but still good. His new novel, straighahead in the vein of Tell No One, is called <a href="http://www.harlancoben.com/excerpts/gfg_excerpt.shtml">Gone For Good</a> and goes on sale late next month, look for it as I'm sure it will be worth the money.</p>
