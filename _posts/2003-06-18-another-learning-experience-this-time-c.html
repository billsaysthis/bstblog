<p>When I first began this time away from employment, I decided that refreshing some tech skills would be a good use of a portion. I learned to be moderately conversant with two free (as in beer and as in speech) systems: a programming language called <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> and a database called <a href="http://www.myswl.net">MySQL</a>. In fact, I wrote most of the code that powers this website using those two things.</p>
<p>But time keeps moving along the Y axis, so to speak, and I still find myself with free (as in unpaid) time. Scoble was <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/03/29.html#a2623" title="This is just the first post he mentions the decision to learn programming">very vocal</a> about learning <a href="http://www.csharp.com/links.html">C#</a> and look where it got him: a tasty job with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">the company</a> with which he most wanted to work. One benefit for me in him going there is cheap access to software at the company store and so yesterday a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/catalog/display.asp?subid=22&amp;site=11513">nice box</a> with many CDs inside showed up at my door. So many CDs, in fact, that combined with the slow speed on my CD drive, installation took something like two and a half hours.</p>
<p>C# is significantly more complex than PHP or any other language I've learned before. I did get somewhat familiar with Java at my last employer, including writing product documentation for a pre-J2EE (at the time) application server, but never to the extent of actually being able to write real applications with it. And I'm not saying I expect to become the next <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/cbrumme/">Chris Brumme</a> or <a href="http://rob.crabapples.net/">Rob Fahrni</a>, just to name two well known C# 'Softies. Today (so far) I sat down, made sure the VS.NET IDE actually starts up and does the basics, and cracked open a book called <em>C#: A Beginner's Guide</em> by <a href="http://shop.osborne.com/cgi-bin/osborne/scan/se=173259/fi=author2isbn/sf=authorcode/op=eq/sp=results%2ehtml/em=yes/st=db.html">veteran author</a> Herbert Schildt and read Chapter One. Now that my brain muscles hurt, I need a break. Good thing I have this blog.</p>
