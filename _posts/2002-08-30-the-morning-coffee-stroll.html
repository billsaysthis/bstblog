<p>What, you might be wondering, does Bill do with all his free time beside hunt for a job and love the Sweet One? Every weekday morning I go for a hot beverage (has been coffee up until now but will be green tea starting next week) with Evan, who is also a longterm victim of the economic craplaise, lives down the block, and worked with me at Sun. Evan is also a massive techhead, skilled and knowledgeable about many things, not the least of which is software design and development, and he decided to bring his digital camera along yesterday. Among other shots he took a few of me featuring the new cap I bought at the Springsteen concert and I combined them into a montage for your viewing pleasure:</p>
