<p>Can any of you get the image of the jet crashing into the side of the tower out of your head? I still get nightmares. I don't feel safer. I don't feel our dead from that day <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/content/news/ap/ap_story.html/Intl/AP.V4782.AP-Afghan-Al-Qaida.html?UrAuth=%60NXNUObNUUbTTUWUXUUUZTZU_UWUbUbUZUaU_UcTYWYWZV">have gotten justice</a>.</p>

<br />Republican exploitation of the day makes me ill. For that matter, not sure Kerry should be <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/09/11/MNGO68N6P91.DTL">playing the Al-Qaeda card</a> so easily either.</p>
<p>More on asshats who try to exploit the day, a short quote from the AP:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>FREEDOM TOWER COIN NOT REAL MONEY The United States Mint advised consumers that a widely advertised coin commemorating the World Trade Center was not a genuine United States coin. National Collectors Mint Inc. has been marketing the 2004 Freedom Tower Silver Dollar, which it claims contains silver recovered from ground zero in New York. One side of the coin, which costs $19.95, shows the Freedom Tower that is planned for the site. The other side shows the old Manhattan skyline, with the World Trade Center. The company marketing the coin says it is the first "legally authorized government issue silver dollar ... to commemorate the World Trade Center and the new Freedom Tower."</p>
<p>The company is not connected to the U.S. government, the U.S. Mint said Friday. The U.S. Mint is the only government entity in the United States with the authority to coin money. National Collectors Mint is advertising the coins as products of the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The U.S. Mint said the commonwealth, as a U.S. insular possession, does not have the authority to coin its own money.</p></blockquote>
<p>And shame on FoxSportsWorld for broadcasting the commercials for this company. What about truth in advertising? Is this not exactly the offense the FTC should be investigating? I think so, so I filed a complaint on the FTC website.<br /></p>
