<p><a href="http://www.harlancoben.com">Harlan Coben</a> wrote a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/15/opinion/15COBE.html?th">superbly touching tribute</a> to his dad for Father's Day in the New York Times. I'm sad for Harlan, that he lost his so long ago, but I'm very glad that my father is still around, still able to gift me with his understanding of the world and his generosity of spirit. I remember some of those Little League days, though Harlan was a year behind me and I never had his dad as a coach; I'm sure he remembers the one coach I do, Mr. Speigel, who was, um, very eager to win and therefore left me on the bench as much as possible.</p>
