<p>Just in case you have odd results with the RSS feed or the webpage is unavailable or email bounces, it's because after publishing this I'm going to switch the DNS from the current hosting company to our new home at <a href="http://www.textdrive.com">TextDrive</a>. Possibly you'll be able to see this place at an alternative address, <a href="http://bst.textdriven.com">http://bst.textdriven.com</a>, and send email to me at bill at the same domain (the whole thing including the bst part).</p>
<p>No big deal and any trouble will clear in a couple of days or less, as soon as the new DNS info (how the nice text web addresses get translated to the numbers computers know and love) propogates through the network. This is one of those instances where a strength of the internet can cause some minor problems</p>
