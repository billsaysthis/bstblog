<p>Okay, why would I see this? Sure the original wasn't terrible but a sequel can't be as good. It wasn't, but TS1 wanted to see it as part of her birthday celebration and who am I to say no?</p>
<p><a href="http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/diaries2/home.html">Princess Diaries 2: The Royal Engagement</a> brings us back to the story of Princess Mia of Genovia (Anne Hathaway, looking lovlier than ever). Five years have passed since she learned her true heritage and she's finished high school and college; the time has come for her to move home and take up responsibility. First in line for the Genovian crown, by law, becomes the country's ruler right after his or her 21st birthday.</p>
<p>Women, though, must be married and this gives director Garry Marshall his hook: John Rhys-Davies, who was so much better as Gimli son of Gloin, wants to put his barely-eligible nephew (Chris Pine) on the throne instead and so reminds everyone that the law also requires female rulers to be married first. The Parliament has given her 30 days to fix things.</p>
<p>Overall Marshall and writer Shonda Rhimes (low: Britney Spears' <em>Crossroads</em>, high: Halle Berry's <em>Introducing Dorothy Dandridge</em>) could have done much better but opted for a few extra easy laughs instead of working the material harder. For instance, the slumber party scene was cute and all but completely irrelevant to the plot and the time would have been much better spent deepening the connection between Mia and her arranged intended (<em>Dead Like Me</em>'s wasted Callum Blue) or having Pine see more of his uncle's underhandedness.</p>
<p><em>recommended for girls age 8-13</em><br /></p>
