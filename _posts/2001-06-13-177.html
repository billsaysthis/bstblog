<p><b>Last night's movie: Swordfish</b><br />

<p>Travolta really knows how to play the hip, hip bad guy, to push the words of his character out of his mouth with menace even while he's charming you. <a href="http://operationswordfish.warnerbros.com/">Swordfish</a> got a mess of bad reviews but a few good ones including three stars from the SJ Mercury News. Hugh Jackman (Wolverine in <a href="http://www.x-men-the-movie.com/xmen-dvd/flash/frames-xmen.html">X-Men</a>) plays the innocent, sort of, good guy, a <a href="http://www.kevinmitnick.com/">Kevin Mitnick</a> type of convicted hacker, who only wants to have his 10 year old daughter back in his life. Dominic Sena, who also directed the bang a minute Gone in 60 Seconds, keeps the cameras moving here with very good pacing and the editing of the end of the opening scene is just excellent. Halle Berry (Storm in X-Men) isn't bad either, but I think producer Joel Silver wasted $500k to get Berry to take her shirt off. Recommended for action film fans.</p>
