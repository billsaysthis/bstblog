<p><b>Script Kiddies versus the terrorists</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.unchartedshores.com/blogger/blogger3.html">Eric Norlin</a>, a post-modern marketing whiz and former NSA spook, explains how we can <a href="http://www.topica.com/lists/tdcrc/read/message.html?mid=1604845459&amp;sort=d&amp;start=30">apply lessons from attacks on the Internet</a> to fighting al Queda and that lot. He explores the similarities between a modern terrorist organization and the Internet: both are "loosely affiliated group of nodes that exhibit emergent properties." So what damages one should have similar effects on the other and therefore <a href="http://staff.washington.edu/dittrich/misc/ddos/">distributed denial of service attacks</a>, viruses, and targeting key nodes should have significant impact on the terrorists. Cool, post-modern fighting techniques.</p>
