<p>Set about 20 years after the end of the <a href="http://www.starwars.com/">original movie trilogy</a>, this collection of six short novels by Kevin Anderson and Rebecca Moesta features Jacen and Jaina Solo (Leia and Han's twins), Lowbacca (Chewbacca the Wookiee's nephew), and Tenel Ka (well, they needed someone to fill out the quartet) as they begin their studies at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Academy. Great for (pre-)teen Star Wars fans only.</p>
