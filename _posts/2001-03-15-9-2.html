<p><b>The man who (plans to) fall to Earth</b>
<p>From FEED:  <a href="http://www.feedmag.com/templates/default.php3?a_id=1645"> http://www.feedmag.com/templates/default.php3?a_id=1645</a></p>
<p>"NEXT YEAR, Rodd Millner, an Australian ex-commando, plans to one-up the American hero Chuck Yeager, the first person to travel faster than the speed of sound. In a stunt that will either redefine the boundaries of science or the boundaries of idiocy, Millner intends to don a space suit and ride a balloon 130,000 feet up to the edge of space. Once he gets there, he will jump."</p>
<p>This will either become the next rich boy hobby or a sad death that will be hailed as heroic and amazing adventure by those for whom life without excitement isn't living at all.</p>
