<p><strong>XML Tower of Babel</strong></p>
<p>eWeek has the article <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article/0,3658,s%253D701%2526a%253D20656,00.asp">XML: Plugging into 'Standard' Hybrids</a> today which brings up the very important point that far from being a saviour, so far XML is just another IT silver bullet wannabe. Almost every industry has come up with their own XML 'dialect'. Emerging vehicles like ebXML and Universal Business Language may provide an answer but they are very slow in coming to a usable state. Of course this is completely in line with the history of software in the enterprise.</p>
