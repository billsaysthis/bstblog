<p>Hey, how many bands do you know that have been making amazing music for 22 years and can still get it up? Sure Bono may be spending lots of time lobbying the White House and 10 Downing Street for African debt relief. But I'm watching a concert on VH1 taped during their 2001 tour and these guys just blow me away. Especially Edge and who even remembers his real name? Bono said during the band intros that even his mom calls him that now. From the opening ringing tones of "I Will Follow" on <em>Boy</em> to on "Beautiful Day" on <em>All That You Can't Leave Behind</em>. And their performance at the Super Bowl. Just fucking amazing.</p>
