<p><strong>Get the quarterback!!!</strong></p>
<p>Author's note: this was just a headline but a few minutes later the Raiders made the first of three interceptions against Doug (I'm Old) Flutie. Which I predicted as the ball was being snapped--just ask the friend who was watching with me. Is the author <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=facetious">cool or what</a>? Hey the <a href="http://www.raiders.com">Raiders</a> won, that's what counts.</p>
