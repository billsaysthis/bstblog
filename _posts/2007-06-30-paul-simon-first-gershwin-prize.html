<p>The Library of Congress established a new award, the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/about/awards/gershwin/">Gershwin Prize for Popular Song</a>, recognizing greatness over a long career and last month Paul Simon became the first recipient. An excellent choice, IMHO, as Simon's music is (to transplant <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2007/pulpit_20070629_002360.html">Cringley's concept</a>) invisible; that is, his songs are so much a part of our culture that they're... just there. You hear the opening notes and make the connection.</p>
<p>To give him the prize, they put on a big show last month in D.C. with Simon and a group of hugely talented artists performing his songs and PBS <a href="http://www.pbs.org/gershwinprize/index.html">was there to capture it</a>. I just finished seeing the HD cablecast recorded the other night and highly recommend you watch it, there are <a href="http://www.pbs.org/gershwinprize/listings.html">many scheduled showings</a>.</p>
<p>Simon does a terrific version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Bridge Over Troubled Water</span> with Art Garfunkel (who still has the big shock of bushy hair ;), though disappointingly the duo sing no other songs together. Since James Taylor was on the bill and did a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tyBxI5E8fQ" title="Still Crazy After All These Years on YouTube">few songs</a> I was hoping the three of them would get together for <span style="font-style:italic;">(What a) Wonderful World</span>, but no luck. Ladysmith Black Mambazo did <span style="font-style:italic;">Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes</span> with Paul plus a song of their own and Simon, Stevie Wonder and the Dixie Humminbirds teamed up for <span style="font-style:italic;">Love Me Like a Rock</span> and the very first song was Simon and Wonder on .</p>
<p>My favorite performance was definitely Allison Kraus and Jerry Douglas on an austere, elegiac interpretation of <span style="font-style:italic;">Graceland</span>. With the tempo slowed to about half that of the recorded version and Douglas's twangy acoustic slide guitar the main backing, Kraus's vocals were spiritual. Just intense!</p>
<p>Between songs video clips were shown. A very amusing duet on <span style="font-style:italic;">Feeling Groovy</span> by Sesame Street's Elmo and Grover, the attempt by Charles Grodin to exploit his similar appearance to Garfunkel in an SNL skit, Simon's sweet performance of <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Robinson</span> in the Yankee Stadium right after Joe Dimaggio passed away and, most memorably, the time George Harrison and Simon performed <span style="font-style:italic;">Homeward Bound</span> on Saturday Night Live, which I'm posting from YouTube:</p>

<p>To be fair, the two also sang <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2TGWDZTrj0">Here Comes the Sun</a>, which I love and is also on YT.</p>
<p>Plenty more I'm not listing, absolutely recommended!</p>
