<p>I saw this cult fave in the cinema during the original release in 1999 but missed the ending, the last six or eight minutes, when the projector burned the last reel. Of course the manager offered to let us come back another day but I wasn't going to sit through the whole thing again just for that.</p>
<p>Five years have passed, though, so when <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/">Office Space</a> showed up on the program guide I decided it was time to finally watch the whole thing, especially since in the intervening time the movie's become the kind of geek in-joke that gets quote every other day. Maybe it was the way Comedy Central bleeped all the slightly naughty words (even though they don't bleep on <em>South Park</em>!), some editing to fit the time slot or being broken up for commercial interludes, but I just didn't come away with the same appreciation for it.</p>
<p>Sure there are some funny bits but jokes have never been a problem for writer/director Mike Judge--after all, just creating <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em> was more than enough to make him a cultural hero--but bottom line is that he picked too easy a target and doesn't put it enough together to make for a truly insightful comedy. My thought is to make an analogy to pushing on a string.</p>
<p><em>cannot decide</em></p>
