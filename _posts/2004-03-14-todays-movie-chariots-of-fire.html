<p>One of the films I remember most fondly from college days (appropriate, eh?), I was surprised that TS1 had never seen <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082158/">Chariots of Fire</a> and when it popped on the <a href="http://www.turnerclassicmovies.com/">TCM</a> schedule there was no doubt we had to watch. This story of a few British runners in post-WWI years won four Oscars in 1982 including Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay and Best Original Soundtrack--everyone knows that seminal new age theme on piano and synth by Vangelis.</p>
<p><em>Chariots of Fire</em> is the true story of Eric Liddle (played by Ian Charleson) and Harold Abrahams (played by Ben Cross) who ran for gold in the 1924 Olympics despite great personal obstacles. Liddle, a devoutly religious man, would not run his qualifying heat because it fell on a Sunday, while Abrahams, who was Jewish, faced anti-Semitism. The bulk of the film sets up the climactic races in Paris and, aside from a single race well before that, the two protagonists really never meet or interact. The movie tells of the mental and athletic preparations as parallel stories.</p>
<p>I find it very interesting that none of the primary group of younger actors (Charleson, Cross, Nigel Havers, Nicholas Farrell and Daniel Gerroll) really went on to have substantial Hollywood careers. Of course John Gielgud and Ian Holm (Bilbo Baggins in the recent LotR movies, for instance) were different but they were older and firmly established by this point. Cross did make a few pictures and big TV miniseries but the rest of them basically went on to British TV, which is sad as the evidence here is that they were capable of more.</p>
<p>This film takes time and trouble to develop the lead characters by way of a series of set pieces, some focused on running while others explore the conflicts which give meaning to their achievements. Abrahams is set off against both his Cambridge chums as well as Holm as his (naughty boy!) professional coach while Liddle mainly has conflict with his equally religious sister.</p>
<p>Hugh Hudson, who did such a fine job directing the movie, also never did much more. I really wonder why that was. The studios are reputedly such strange, dangerous and incestuous places but one would think that Hudson would have earned more than such schlock as <em>Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes</em> and <em>Revolution</em> (the Al Pacino Revolutionary War flick) but there you go.</p>
