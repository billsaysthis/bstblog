<p>Um, but would an adult want the <a href="http://www.broadbent.net/classifieds.htm">essence of sweat</a>? Scott Broadbent did a little experimenting in his home chemistry lab and made some 3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid. He will sell it to you, $40 plus postage for 20 mL. Oh yeah, that's on my holiday shopping list!</p>
