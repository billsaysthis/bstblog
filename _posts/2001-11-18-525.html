<p><b>Steven throws down the gauntlet!</b></p>
<p>Steven DenBeste, a self-styled "a demented starship captain who sometimes dreams that he lives in San Diego," has written some of the best commentary I've seen on the war against terrorism. He and I are very much in agreement on a key point, that neither of us have seen "a single convincing argument against this war, because they all had the same fundamental flaw: none of them would work in the real world. None of them would actually solve the problem we face." Now he <a href="http://denbeste.nu/entries/00001385.shtml">has challenged</a> three weblogging anti-war writers to a debate:</p>
<p><em>Resolved: The United States is correct to be fighting this war and should not stop doing so.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.rebeccablood.net/">Rebecca Blood</a> was given the original challenge but she has <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/12428#176351">declined</a>; I am waiting to see which others will debate Steven via weblog, each posting arguments and counterarguments to their own sites. Anyone can drop out at any point and the judgement of winner and loser is up to us, the reading public. I am sure this will be a very interesting series to follow.</p>
