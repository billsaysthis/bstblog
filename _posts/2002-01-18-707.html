<p><strong>Tha Dogg gets dirty</strong></p>
<p>I knew that Snoop Dogg was getting into movies, I saw him play a crippled dealer in <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_10_07_blog_archive.phtml#6250709">Training Day</a>. But I bet you didn't know he's also making porn. In fact, <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0282988">Doggystyle</a> (and how original is that?) <a href="http://www.sonicnet.com/news/story.jhtml?id=1451830">won two Adult Video News awards</a> last week.</p>
