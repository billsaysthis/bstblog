<p>Had a big shock on the Atkins front the other day when I went to the store for our monthly restocking of muffin mix and bars. The idiots in charge at Atkins Nutritionals (the company that makes the food products) changed the formulation of the muffin mix and now it has more than twice as many carbs as before. Considering TS1 and I eat them every morning as a key part of our breakfast, this is really maddening.</p>
<p>I subscribe to the email newsletter, I get the bi-monthly paper catalog, I visit the website on occasion, and in none of those places was any change announced in advance. If we'd have known, we could have gone in ahead of the change and bought a big supply since once we reach phase three the extra carbs will not be a problem. But no! the management morons decided this was a big secret which customers couldn't be let in on.</p>
<p>You don't suppose the fact that the new packaging also raises the price substantially had anything to do with their decision, do you? Right, the old packages had enough mix to make, by their calculations, 18 muffins and GNC charged $5.99 per box while the new ones make only a dozen and GNC charges $5.49 per box.</p>
<p>I called up their customer service line to get an explanation and maybe see if they had any in the warehouse I could buy. No, the mental midgets sold out their stock of the old formulation before shipping the new stuff, so even that possibility is gone. What were these people thinking? Damn, really does suck!</p>
