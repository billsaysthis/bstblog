<p>Pick your characters, backgrounds, and props, add some narrative and dialog <a href="http://www.stripcreator.com/make.php">et voila</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/images/strips/woasd1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/woasd1a.jpg" alt="Click to see the whole strip" /></a></p>
<p>Careful, though, since the FAQ says: "How can I edit or delete my comics? People who have donated to Stripcreator now have access to the comic deleting feature." And the toy doesn't offer a simple way to download the results to your PC, I had to do a screen print and paste it into a new image in PaintShop Pro. Still, could be fun.</p>
