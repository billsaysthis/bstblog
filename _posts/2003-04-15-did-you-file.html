<p>Today, being Tax Day, reminds me to ask: where is my (<a href="http://www.johnny.moped.btinternet.co.uk/origins/p/origins_pittance.html">pittance</a> of a) refund already? You'd think having next to no income last year but having some large deductible expenses, primarily the mortgage on Casa Lazar, I'd get a decent refund, maybe a couple of thousand dollars. But no, the Feds will only give you back what you actually paid, not more, and then self-employment taxes (from the two months with Pyra) don't seem to figure in as refundable, cutting my payout further. Isn't six or seven weeks long enough for them to send me that itty bitty check?</p>
