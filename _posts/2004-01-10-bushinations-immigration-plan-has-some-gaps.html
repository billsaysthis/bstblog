<p>I have some questions about the new 'guest worker' plan announced by Bush this week, plus similar concerns to those <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/09/opinion/09ABRA.html">expressed by David Abraham</a>. Most significant questions right now are: (1) current work visas require the employer to attempt to hire an American first, what does the proposal say on this and (2) what happens when a three year period is up and the worker has no job, will he be forced to leave? These need answers before anything is put into law by Congress.</p>
