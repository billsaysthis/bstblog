<p>Dave Winer, who often writes, or at least links to, interesting material also sometimes confuses readers with his blatantly wrong statements. This is a man who has moved through web technology since it came out, more or less, and co-invented XML-RPC. Then he goes and <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/02/13#areTablesReallyEvil">writes something ridiculous</a>: "Finally, those of us who use tables are part of a mass of people who learned to develop websites that way. It's impossible to get us to change." Winer wrote this in a conversation with Dave Polaschek; Winer asked and Polaschek answered the question <a href="http://davespicks.com/essays/notables.html">Why avoiding tables (for layout) is important</a>. Definitely <a href="http://winerlog.weblogger.com/">WinerLog</a> material. Dave, you've learned and unlearned so many technologies and techniques over a 25+(?) year programming career that I can't believe you would stoop to this level but then again you've surprised me before.</p>
