<p><strong>Saturday's movie 2: Behind Enemy Lines</strong></p>
<p>In the current highly charged environment, this <a href="http://www.behindenemylinesmovie.com/">film</a> plays like a lit match in a tinderbox. Good but fed up American Navy pilot (<a href="http://us.imdb.com/EGallery?source=ss&amp;group=0212338&amp;photo=8&amp;path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Wilson,+Owen">the dreamy, I'm told, Owen Wilson</a>) tires of playing cop on a beat where he isn't wanted (Bosnia) nears the end of his hitch and turns in his resignation. Trying to teach him a lesson, the grumpy old admiral (Gene Hackman, who works a lot for a 71 year old) sends our boy on a Christmas recon mission. Sure enough, something goes wrong, the plane goes "off-mission," gets shot down by some really good bad guys (Serbs trying to sneak a little genocide past a peace treaty), and the horse are off on a race. Joaquin de Almeda plays a Spanish NATO admiral who keeps getting in Hackman's way. Wilson and Hackman play off each other on a series of radio conversations. Nicely done action sequences, I never felt like Wilson had to do something completely impossible to escape Serb bullets, and the radio conversations give good pause and punctuation to the ever more dangerous movement--good direction by John Moore in what is apparently his first time out. Strong action film, recommended.</p>
