<p>Are you into prototyping circuit boards? If so, check out <a href="http://www.schmartboard.com/">SchmartBoard</a> and their patent-pending pre-traced printed circuit boards that are connectable like building blocks. My personal electronics expert and I went to the company's initial presentation today over in Milpitas and found their offering quite interesting and valuable. Not to mention that one of the founders, Neal Greenberg, is a friend and a real mensch. Good stuff.</p>
