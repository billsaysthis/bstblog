<p><b>Back, back in a NY Groove</b><br />

<p>Well, I'm not, and haven't been, in NY, but I was in New Jersey for about 20 hours and I am back from Italy. And Back in the New York Groove was the only decent song from <a href="http://www.rocknrollhell.com/frehley/">Ace Frehley's</a> solo career. Dad and I had a great trip together, good times in Palermo (and elsewhere on Sicily) and Sorrento. The food was...different than I expected but still generally very tasty, the people were friendly, and some of the places we visited were totally awesome (<a href="http://www.bestofsicily.com/segesta.htm">Segesta</a>, Agrigento, Pompei). I wrote a detailed journal (plus writeups on the vacation reading) and took two rolls of film, which I hope to have in electronic form and on this site at <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/misc/italy_trip.phtml">The Italy Trip</a> within the week.</p>
