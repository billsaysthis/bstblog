<p>Last night and this morning I was reading about the latest revelations on GWB's National Guard service (an appropriate context for using such a Biblical term) and then <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/?p=4493">Garret pointed to</a> Michael Lynch's essay <a href="http://chronicle.com/free/v51/i03/03b00601.htm">Who Cares About the Truth?</a> in The Chronicle and I said to myself, you know, there's definitely a connection here.</p>
<p>Sure our verbally-challenged Prez comes from a long line of politicians. Sure he's a tall, good looking guy, a big advantage in our media-driven age. Sure he's good at standing and delivering a message.</p>
<p>But why--and I'm talking about years ago, long before 9/11--were the Texas and later national Republicans so enamored of him that they disregarded all the negatives of his personal history? Why would they go to such lengths to cover up the truth to propel him to political success? This is one of the more difficult points for me to understand in the whole Bush story.</p>
<p>One National Guard officer who served at the same time as GWB says that even if the latest information to come out is correct and that GWB did simply not show up for duty, <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/world/9607008.htm">so what</a>, that was something hundreds or thousands of other young men did at the time. Why single out one man? My answer is that those other men aren't running for the highest office in the land. And if any of them were to run for an election I was voting in I'd certainly take this as a point against. The White House spokesman, of course, refused to give a straight answer to reporters.</p>
<p>There is, though, at least one living person who knows the truth about whether or not George W. Bush snorted coke, helped (if that's the correct word) a girlfriend get an abortion, and fulfilled his duty in the National Guard. And that person is of course GWB himself. But apparently he doesn't have the same perspective on truth as people like myself do.<br /></p>
