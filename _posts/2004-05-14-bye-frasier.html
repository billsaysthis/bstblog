<p>Watched the <em>Frasier</em> finale last night. I thought the writers did a pretty good job, bringing out the strongest elements of the lead actors, visiting some favorite regulars and tying up some loose ends. I thought they would have at least mentioned Maris, the source of so many joke over the years, but perhaps I missed some denouement in her story line having not watched the last few seasons. Little as I thought of him, I have to give props to Kelsey Grammer for keeping his character on top for 20 years: Way to go, dude!</p>
