<p>My my my. Who would ever have thought that the Bush Administration would go to such lengths? Well, besides me and Michael Moore, that is. This time we see that banks should <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/22/opinion/22wed3.html">make excess profits</a> instead of funding more student loans while low income families in cities like New York face being tossed in the streets so the Administration can <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/22/nyregion/22housing.html?hp">cut housing subsidies</a>.</p>
<p>Somehow, though, the <a href="http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000087&amp;sid=aPOmXxIQ9Xx8&amp;refer=top_world_news">latest poll from Zogby</a> shows the incumbent and challenger in a dead heat. Polls, like <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/09/22/MNGBF8SNO11.DTL">media news reporting</a>, should be taken with a grain of salt but I remain amazed at the capacity of my fellow citizens to ignore simple facts and thereby threaten our future with a second term for a man who, well, let's just not go there.</p>
<p>My top frustration is that every day, nearly, I see new evidence that the Bush crew have certain... objectives and operating processes that are so far away from anything I consider right or reasonable and yet do not lose supporters. The latest key demographic, for instance, are the security moms, women who've moved on from driving their kids to soccer, yet these women seem to utterly ignore the difference between the Administration's situational spin and reality.</p>
<p>But then, these security moms are not the people who need Section 8 housing subsidies and don't see the shenanigans being pulled by banks and the Department of Education.<br /></p>
