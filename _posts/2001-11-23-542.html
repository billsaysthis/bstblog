<p><strong>My Micro-advertising experiment, part 1</strong></p>
<p>Well, all of the <a href="http://www.pyrads.com">Pyrad</a> impressions on Blogger.com for which <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_11_11_blog_archive.phtml#7156983">I paid</a> have been delivered; somehow the service actually gave me a bonus of three extra views. Pyrads is reporting 24 click throughs, or a 0.719% rate, but I believe there were actually nearly twice that many given what I saw in my referrer logs. Between this advertising, my mention in WinerLog, and good fortune, I had over 600 visitors in the last week, far more than any week since I launched the site. Woohoo! I think I might try a MetaFilter micro-ad next week and see what that delivers. Still, it's all in fun and for <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.07/egoboo.html">egoboo</a>.</p>
