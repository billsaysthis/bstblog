<p>Just finished watching today's UEFA Cup championship match between Olympique Marseilles and FC Valencia, which the Spaniards <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=151334&amp;cc=5901">won with ease 2-0</a>. I understand better why Manchester United headman Alex Ferguson was willing to toss aside goalkeeper Fabien Barthez for young American Tim Howard.</p>
<p>Barthez returned to Marseilles after being dismissed by ManU, though he ran afoul of FIFA transfer rules and had to sit for three months for the next opening. He's done reasonably well over the last five months and matched well with the team's sturdy defense to reach this tournament final. But after a meandering, meaningless first half was almost done, his lack of complete mental toughness came out and ruined the team.</p>
<p>With a beautiful cross to the far side of the six yard box from Torres, Mista chested the ball down and only Barthez was between the Valencia striker and his goal. Instead of cutting down the angle or sliding and throwing his hands in the way, the French National Team keeper, a man whose earned many medals and trophies over the last dozen years, instead chose to slide into Mista feet first.</p>
<p>Penalty kick. Even worse, Barthez was sent off with a red card for a professional foul. The decision by referee Pierluigi Collina, widely ranked as the world's best, could not be disputed and was not, even in comments by the losing coach after the game.</p>
<p>Vicente stepped up to the spot and, after waiting nearly two minutes for (rarely used, 20 year old) substitute Jeremy Gavanon to take his place, easily put the ball into the net. Marseilles never again really threatened and a second goal, just before the hour from Mista, sealed the trophy for Valencia. A great year for them as this will look lovely in their display next to the one for the 2003-2004 Primera Liga title.</p>
