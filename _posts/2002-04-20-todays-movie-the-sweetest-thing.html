<p>Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate, and Selma Blair prove that girls rule in <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/thesweetestthing/splash.html">The Sweetest Thing</a>, which was a funny cross of Scary Movie and My Best Friend's Wedding. Just like in Scary Movie Blair is the butt of an oral sex joke although this time a piercing causes the trouble. The film makes a big deal of how gorgeous Diaz is but if I had to choose I'd take Applegate in a heartbeat, no hesitation; one of the movie's jokes is how Diaz breasts have slipped a little since she was 22, her character is 28, but in real life <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Diaz,+Cameron">she's 30</a> and I think her thin, angular face may not age all that well. The director was smart enough not to have Applegate do the same, he even denigrated her breasts as fake in another scene, or she would have stolen the movie.</p>
<p>Screenwriter Nancy Pimental is previously credited as a writer on South Park and I can see some of that influence here, such as the exchange between Applegate and a little boy in the church scene. Thomas Jane doesn't have nearly enough to do as the object of Diaz's affection but that's probably due to the fact that the film's too short at around 83 minutes. Georgina Engels (yes, the blonde from the Mary Tyler Moore Show) has a cute cameo as a campy clothing store owner and Parker Posey, obviously taking the money, is cute but has no decent lines as Jane's fiancee. <em>Recommended</em></p>
