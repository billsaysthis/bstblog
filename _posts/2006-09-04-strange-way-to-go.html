<p>Crocodile hunter Steve Irwin <a href="http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,20349534-952,00.html">died today</a> from the barb of a manta ray while filming a segment of his daughter's documentary in the waters off Cairnes, Australia (<a href="http://forum.textdrive.com/viewtopic.php?id=11734">TxD discussion</a>). Seems strange to me that Irwin didn't take better precautions since he, better than most, knew the danger of those waters. Heck, when I was planning a vacation to Australia Cairnes was my planned resort destination until the travel agent, a native who'd moved to the Bay Area, explained how dangerous those beaches are and steered me to Noosa on the Gold Coast instead.</p>
