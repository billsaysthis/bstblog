<p>[<span style="font-style:italic;">This is from six years ago, written in a work notebook uncovered in sorting out the move...</span>]</p>
<p>I can see a whole life racing time<br />In a single tear dripping from your eye,<br />Colors and expression and people pass through<br />Baby born, an old woman waiting to die.</p>
<p>My head feels the heat from the passion<br />Radiating from your cheek to my skin.<br />I would pull away, run away, except our<br />Horses gallop together, as the day begins.</p>
<p>"Make me taste yesterday's passion,"<br />You scream across the morning sun<br />Trying to say what, I wonder idly,<br />Since our lovemaking was so mundane.</p>
<p>Another tear slithers down,<br />And another, catching the light<br />Glaring in my eyes, glaring thoughts<br />Confusion spreading, anger rising to match</p>
<p>The horses jump a brook and we cross<br />Into a new terrain, peopled with brush and ravines<br />"Stop," I say, "tell me why you need this taste."<br />But you ride on, oblivious in the morning sun.</p>
