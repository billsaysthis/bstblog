<p>Bush Crew to DC: <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=1802&amp;u=/washpost/20050111/ts_washpost/a63896_2005jan10&amp;printer=1">Get Stuffed!</a>. Our geniuses in the Administration, continuing to ignore reality, tell the District of Columbia to pay for $17 million in expenses from the money allocated by Congress to pay for homeland security in our capitol. How willfully ignorant are these people when even the Republican chairmen of DC's congressional oversight committee says this is a terrible idea and Bush apologista Drudge has it on his front page?</p>
