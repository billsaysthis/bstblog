<p>"Sorry about knocking your coffee all over you," Jamie said, "just thinking too much about the clods at my office. Can we sit and drink our coffees together?"</p>
<p>She looked him over and then smiled. "Sure, why not. I'm Lara. I work with clods too. Don't suppose you're at the same place?"</p>
<p>"No, I work at a pretty small place and we'd know each other already if we did. I'm Jamie." Now that he was looking at her, rather than focusing on his co-workers, he realized she was, well, gorgeous. Better looking than any woman who'd ever gave him the time of day before. Maybe he should 'accidentally' knock over more coffee cups.</p>
<p>"Oh, I see, so what is it you do, Jamie?"</p>
<p>"I write software. How about you?" He looked and didn't see any ring on the appropriate finger.</p>
<p>"I'm in the marketing department. I know everyone around here is so high tech but I work for a boring old place. The men who run it are really old-fashioned but they like money and they know how to make it. My mom worked for them before she stayed home to take care of me and my brother. Do you live near here?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, just up the road a piece. I only stopped in so I'd get to the office later. One of the doofi on my team sent a really aggravating email just before I left the house."</p>
<p>"You read work email at home?" She seemed pretty surprised.</p>
<p>"Sure. But that's just because I work at home mostly and only go into the office one day a week. And I try and make that one day as short as possible. So you live nearby?" Jamie tried a little smile as he asked that. She seemed to notice and he wondered why he was ever nervous about talking to such beautiful women. Lara wasn't too tall, maybe 5'5", totally slim, wavy blonde hair past her shoulders, deep green eyes, great, angular cheekbones, and lips he was already dreaming about kissing.</p>
<p>"Not too far, over in Burlingame. I was just over here running an errand." She licked her lips that sent a shiver up Jamie's spine.</p>
<p>Then, all too soon, both their cups were empty and she got up to leave. Jamie kicked the little nervous man inside his chest to the side and offered to walk her out. He held the door open for her and couldn't help notice how nicely her legs slid up right into her short red skirt. She pointed out her Miata, shielding her eyes form the sunlight, as they walked towards it.</p>
<p>Jamie heard a popping sound, then another, just as they reached the car. Lara screamed and jumped down between it and the Honda parked next to it. Jamie wondered why and then noticed the hole in the side of the Miata. He scrambled down next to Lara.</p>
