<p>For the first time in seventeen years, I have a date with the Boss! No real hassle getting tickets either, we showed up just before 9:30 at Tower Records, and one of the employees came out five minutes later and held a little drawing. The Sweet One got the seventh place in line and by 10:10 we had the shiny pieces of paper that the greedy monopolists at Ticketmaster were good enough to sell me for only a $9.90 per ticket service charge:</p>

<p>The good folks at Compaq Center, soon to be HP Pavillion, at San Jose show the view from our seats:</p>

<p>Jon Pareles, writing in the NY Times, has an excellent album preview and interview: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/14/arts/music/14PARE.html">Bruce Springsteen: His Kind of Heroes, His Kind of Songs</a>.</p>
<p>The Times also has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/14/arts/music/14SISA.html">Life on E Street: From Sessions to `The Sopranos'</a>, short updates on each of the E Streeters.</p>
