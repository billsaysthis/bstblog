<p>Microsoft has released their new blogging tool, <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/">MSN Spaces</a>, so I've created an experimental version of <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/billsaysthis/">BillSaysThis</a> there. The site seems to be bending under the traffic at the moment so I can't get at the Help but my initial impressions are, hey, what do you expect for free. There are some nice touches but definitely some fit and finish issues that are lacking but important to me.</p>
<p>Okay, now I got into the Help. Apparently some of this is a We don't want to be friendly to Firefox thing: "If you are using a Windows operating system with either MSN Explorer or Internet Explorer 4.0 or later, you can use the rich text tool to format your blog entries exactly the way you want." Swell.<br /></p>
