<p>Liverpool <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/england/2002/20021102/reports/54529_full.html">won 2-0</a> to maintain their margin at the top of the English League, with Michael Owen scoring both goals. Heskey was back on the front line with Owen, no Baros or Diouf, Diao was the playmaker in midfield, and Gerrard got a valuable rest playing only the final 20 minutes after taking Valdimir Smicer's place.</p>
<p><a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=223060087">Notre Dame lost</a> to unranked Boston College, woohoo! The absolute archrivals to my alma mater breakdown against a bunch of nobodies.</p>
<p>Florida saves their season by beating undefeated, fifth ranked Georgia in The World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party 20-13. Neither team had a kicking game, punts or field goals, nor a third down offense worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Pitt beats undefeated, third ranked Virginia Tech 28-21 on the back of some great receiving from freshman Larry Fitzgerald.</p>
<p>North Carolina State, 9-0 and ranked number 10, lost to the Rambling Wreck of Georgia Tech.</p>
<p>All these undefeated teams losing surely helps the BCS (and therefore major bowl) chances of the Trojans! Coming into the weekend, USC was 11 in the <a href="http://www.collegebcs.com/cy/bcs.html">BCS standings</a>. NC State was 9 and we should move ahead of them. How far will Va Tech fall from #6 for losing to an unranked team? Going forward, keys will be how Washington State (BCS rank: 8 and a win in hand over us) plays out and our season-ending matchups against UCLA and Notre Dame.</p>
<p>And the best of the "bad" news: <a href="http://espn.go.com/oly/news/2002/1102/1454873.html">New York City gets U.S. nod for 2012 Summer Games</a>. Since I was <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_07_14_blog_archive.phtml#85250352">completely against</a> San Francisco getting the bid, this is terrific.</p>
<p>Bonus non-sports link: The trailer for the next Pixar/Disney animation is <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/disney/finding_nemo/">now online</a> and looks tempting for this coming Memorial Day weekend.</p>
