<p><strong>Great Chefs: Guilty Pleasure</strong></p>
<p>Another great cable show that hypnotizes me with the cool anonymous vioceover is <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/greatchefs/greatchefs.html">Great Chefs</a> (and its cousin Great Chefs of the World). These shows are very simple, every episode features three chefs, one cooks an appetizer/starter, one an entree, and one a dessert. Discovery Channel (you know, the place where they do it) shows this every weekday afternoon except Fridays when they show the unappealing <a href="http://www.epicurious.com">Epicurious</a>. I watch and just get a chill, you know? Doesn't matter who cooks or what they cook.</p>
