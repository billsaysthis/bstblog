<p>RSN, of course, is a TLA that means Real Soon Now. An old standby in the software business. Customer question: When will that bug be fixed? Vendor answer: Real soon now. Sun announced today that RSN they will <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-920305.html?tag=fd_lede">include a free application server</a> with Solaris 9. Well, not until next year, actually. And now customers will have to pay for Solaris on multi-processor computers even though they don't pay now. (Did I mention that about 99% of the servers Sun sells have two or more CPUs?)</p>
<p>The only price information I can find is "$50 and up." But the app server, and directory server too, will be included. Since we used to list the price of the application server, when I worked there, at as much as $35,000 per CPU (including a directory server license), this is probably a price break for customers. New level of competition for BEA too, eh? Further, Sun will also <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article/0,3658,s=701&amp;a=27118,00.asp">include file system and volume management improvements</a> in Solaris 9 that eliminate the need for customers to purchase corresponding Veritas products that run up to $40,000 plus support. A Veritas spokesman says this is only a minor inconvenience for his company.</p>
