<p>Not meaning to be facetious or facile with this post, just to put this in front of the few eyes that may not otherwise see it. Genocide Watch has <a href="http://www.genocidewatch.org/alerts/zimbabwe200202.htm">declared a Politicide Watch</a> as these seasoned outsiders see many, many deaths on the horizon. The Economist <a href="http://www.economist.com/agenda/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=1044843">recaps the absurd farce of an election</a> through which the aging despot Robert Mugabe held on to power, the "coup by ballot box" as the magazine termed it. <a href="http://www.rnw.nl/humanrights/zimbabwe/html/aids.html">AIDS</a> is raging through this nation, even as Mugabe decimates its on most other strata. And on a personal level, I refer you to praetor_lex's <a href="http://denbeste.nu/ubb-cgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=000765">Clueless Comments post</a>.</p>
