<p>Despite all the hype 14 year old phenom did not start for DC United, though props to him for the cool Sierra Mist commercial with Pele. First game for us with Dominic Kinnear as head coach, no major changes to the squad though Brian Ching is back from injury and Cliff Ronier out for the season on a bad ankle.</p>
<p>Sloppy first half by the Quakes, no shots at all for Landon Donovan and goals by Moreno on a header off a free kick and Eskandarian on a defensive blunder for DC and Ronnie Ekelund scored San Jose's on a penalty kick.</p>
<p>Disappointing job by the referee Kevin Scott, who stopped play on too many foul occasions when he should have allowed the advantage to play on and who missed a couple of obvious yellows to DC players. ABC's coverage was mediocre, they must have mentioned Adu, shown him on the bench or mentioned/shown his Mom at least once every 60 seconds, and I didn't care for the play by play by JP della Camera nor for the in-game interviews with the coaches either.</p>
<p>DC United blew two empty net opportunities early in the second half, Convey the first time and Stewart the second. Good goal work by Onstadt to make up for defensive blunders.</p>
<p>Adu came on around the hour mark for second goal scorer Eskandarian, getting a standing ovation from the home crowd. Donovan finally got a shot off about the 65th, a blast which Rimando was able to leap and block off to the side. Quakes actually seem to finally be getting a rhythm, putting pressure on the offensive third. With just under 20 minutes left, Brian Ching comes on for Ronnie Ekelund and Donovan will drop back to let Ching play in the box.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after, Quakes defender Craig Waibel (the guy with the multi-colored goatee) gets sent off for a late harsh tavkle, a really bad call, even the color guy is saying the ref blew another one. Have to play the last 15 or so with ten men. After some sloppy play Scott called another red, this time on United's Kovalenko, for a nasty elbow to the face which the league has warned are going to be called every time; Kinnear put on another out and out striker, Jamil Walker, now that the sides are even at 10 men.</p>
<p>Adu got alone in the box in the 83rd and went down under close marking but didn't get a foul called--welcome to MLS, Freddy! Fouls and physical play all over the field, a yellow to Ben Olsen. Four minutes of stoppage time, giving us some hope but DC has had much of the last few minutes' possession. Donovan not playing well at all, bad passes and dribbling. Nerves, nerves, can we get the equalizer??? NO, dammit, the second half whistle blows and we go down.</p>
