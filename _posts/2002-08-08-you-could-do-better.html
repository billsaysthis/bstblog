<p>This is a movie I like the sound of: <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0315327">Bruce Almighty</a>. Jim Carrey plays an average Joe who ridicules and rages against God (probably to be played by Morgan Freeman, which is a great touch likely to give racists ulcers) and God turns around and says "Okay, see if you can do any better." Jennifer Aniston looks to play Carrey's significant other. Ha!</p>
