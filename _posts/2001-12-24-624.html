<p><strong>Idiots to the left of us</strong></p>
<p>I wasn't going to blog Stephanie Salter's SF Chronicle column titled <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/12/23/ED68324.DTL">W.W.J.D.?</a> She means us to understand the title as What Would Jesus Do. <a href="http://www.lileks.com/bleats/122401rant.html">Others</a> have delivered <a href="http://denbeste.nu/entries/00001675.shtml">responses</a> as well but I, as is my wont lately, wrote her an email and here is the short and simple:</p>
<p>Ms. Salter,</p>
<p>You have got to be kidding with this column. It was a joke right? Turning the other cheek would be your answer to four downed airliners and a force of thousands that would be only too glad to add a lot more to that total?</p>
<p>I am surely against violence for violence's sake but self-defense is quite a different story. And Stephanie, aren't you glad that there were and are men and women willing to take up arms so that you can write such nonsense?</p>
