<p>Or rather that part of it I peruse. Sometimes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.evhead.com">Ev</a> announces <a href="http://www.blogger.com/news_archive.pyra?which=2002_11_01_news_archive.xml#85715099">the winner</a> of the Blogger website redesign contest, Kevin Conboy. The winning design, though, is kept secret and he doesn't even provide a link to Conboy. Google didn't turn up much, except perhaps he is the Kevin Conboy who just joined <a href="http://www.creationchamber.com/">Creation Chamber</a> as Design Director.</p>
<p>Jason unveils the redesign of <a href="http://www.shellen.com/">Shellen.com</a>, which is nice and makes me jealous because as much as he might badmouth his own design skills, they are still better than mine.</p>
<p>Still in the Pyra world, <a href="http://www.saladwithsteve.com/">Steve</a>, who loves any programming language he finds for at least 15 minutes, seriously needs a redesign but at least updated his blogroll. Jason doesn't believe in blogrolls, apparently, since he's never really had one on his site.</p>
<p>garret <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/posts/02/20021127">thinks</a> a bum tooth and a big holiday make a good enough excuse to avoid the daily linkage! the nerve!</p>
<p><a href="http://theflangynews.editthispage.com/">Adam</a> is getting over his serious headcold with a marathon Metroid Prime session.</p>
<p><a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/">Wes</a> is intermittently offline--I got a 404 just now. This has been happening for days now. Then again, he is always doing something odd, like moving or playing with his DNS.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.whump.com/moreLikeThis/index.php3">Whump</a> is <a href="http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/zing/zing-home.html">just</a> <a href="http://www.adtmag.com/article.asp?id=7004">being</a> <a href="http://www.whump.com/moreLikeThis/link/03185">geeky</a>!</p>
<p>PhilR is <a href="http://philringnalda.com/archives/002389.php">gnawing</a>. Given that tomorrow is what it is, seems like good practice to me. Though we are having Cornish Game Hens here.</p>
<p>Karl, in a more serious holiday vein, <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/weblog/kmartino/archives/002806.shtml#002806">asks</a> that we contemplate the true meaning behind the "What Wold Jesus Drive?" <a href="http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/4605366.htm">campaign</a>. He's certainly right to say that those who dismiss it by citing the recent priestly misadventures is a copout. And happy Big 3rd to him and his Sweet One!</p>
<p>Jason L. left the pediatric ward behind, for a few precious moments at least, to <a href="http://q.queso.com/index.php?archives/001088.php">conjure up</a> a cool <a href="http://q.queso.com/index.php?archives/000443.php">search term highlighting function</a> integrated into his Movable Type installation.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pamslife.com/">Pam</a>, with a little help from your's truly and my small bag of PHP tricks, posted a <a href="http://www.pamslife.com/hsphotos/hsphotos.phtml">large gallery</a> of classic high school marching band photos. Her marching band, that is, from back in the day.</p>
<p>John Lim responds to a reader's questions on PHP in a very <a href="http://php.weblogs.com/discuss/msgReader$2082">practical, pragmatic way</a>. Just like PHP itself.</p>
<p>DaveW is, well, <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/11/26#When:4:01:53PM">just being Dave</a>. I would point out that I am still not in his blogroll.</p>
<p>Steven posted a <a href="http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2002/11/Differentandworse.shtml">clueful entry</a> on Islam. Not everyone got the point.</p>
<p>The Sweet One had a <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/vivroar/archives/2002_11_24_archive.html#85722942">tough commute</a> this morning. But soon her commutes will be much shorter and she will have much more time to devote to me. Which is the point of everything anyway.</p>
<p>I am hungry now.</p>
