<p><strong>2210: No more TVs, computers, or hospitals</strong></p>
<p>Frederick Pohl is one of the last authors of science fiction's Golden Age still actively writing; I was surprised that he's <a href="http://www.mit.edu/afs/athena/org/t/transition/scifi/profile_pohl_sf.html">only 82</a>, since he was writing published stories and editing major magazines in the mid 1930s. Not only is he still writing but some of his most popular and meaningful works have come in recent years, including the Gateway/Heechee series (another title is on the way next year) and Eschaton Sequence. SciFi Weekly has an <a href="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue240/interview.html">interesting interview</a> with him in their latest issue. The 2210 reference above, by the way, comes from one of his answers when asked to name five things which will no longer be around in the year 2210. [He] said, "There will not be any computers, television sets, traffic jams, hospitals or airports." As a kid I loved his collaborations with Cyril Kornbluth, particularly <a href="http://ftp.logica.com/~stepneys/sf/dani/023.htm">The Space Merchants</a>.</p>
