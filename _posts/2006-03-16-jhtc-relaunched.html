<p>It's <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_10_17_blog_archive.phtml#109838346933012037">been awhile</a> since I mentioned a Jewish High Tech Community meeting but, after waiting on a process that never seemed to reach its own event horizon, I organized a new meeting myself. Last night a hard core group of ten showed up at Congregation Kol Emeth (thanks, Betty!) to hear Shelley Hebert talk about the <a href="http://campusforjewishlife.org/">Taube-Koret Campus for Jewish Life</a> being built on the old Sun Microsystems HQ parcel in Palo Alto. Talk about coincidences!</p>
<p>This is a really exciting, unique project which will create a focal point for Jewish social life in the South Peninsula area, though it won't open until the beginning of 2009, mixing senior and affordable housing, state of the art fitness and entertainment facilities, a pre-school, office space for related organizations and more. Assuming they get the plans through the so-called Palo Alto process intact. A <a href="http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/story.php?story_id=585">very positive editorial</a> in yesterday's Palo Alto Weekly should help and then construction can start at the end of this year or very early next.</p>
<p>10 people may not seem like a lot but I was happy. After a 15 month layoff that never seemed to get a good explanation, I got tired of waiting and so made a few emails to arrange the use of the facilities and the speaker. I lost a couple of weeks waiting on an answer for the use of a different space so the announcement only went out three weeks ago, not much warning at all, and there were a few conflicting events.</p>
<p>The next meeting will probably be on either the second or third Tuesday or the third Wednesday in May. I need to look over the local community calendar maintained by the Federation, which I just found out about last night, and also see about a meeting place and speaker. The two months will definitely give us more time to publicize it and hopefully give members more time to arrange their schedules.</p>
<p>Very cool!</p>
