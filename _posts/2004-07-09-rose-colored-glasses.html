<p>Get out your rose colored glasses<br />
<br />Put on your long red dress<br />
<br />Don't worry about the grey swirling clouds<br />
<br />Passing under your feet, through your legs</p>
<p>Honey those glasses make everything alright<br />
<br />As if Snow White and Cinderella both came<br />
<br />Visiting and stayed to tea and crumpets<br />
<br />Just take my word and put them on</p>
<p>Hold your arms out straight as long as you can<br />
<br />Let them fall back against your waist<br />
<br />Bow your head forward without lifting them<br />
<br />Tell me how the clouds make you feel</p>
<p>Look up again at the sky, even straight<br />
<br />Into the Sun, listen for the birds, the cars,<br />
<br />The planes passing overhead and carrying<br />
<br />So many people who never pay you mind</p>
<p>No, Sweetie, you can't sit just yet<br />
<br />You have no sons to care for you, no savings<br />
<br />To tide you until your day has come<br />
<br />Just put those glasses on and turn around</p>
<p>Your work is here in front of you and<br />
<br />It will never go away no matter how old,<br />
<br />How tired you get, if your beauty stays<br />
<br />All well and good, goes better with those glasses</p>
<p>When I was a child I had a magic decryptor ring<br />
<br />That gave me secret messages from the comics<br />
<br />But now I can't find that ring to give you<br />
<br />Can your rose colored glasses save you?</p>
<p>There's a man to your right, a woman to your left<br />
<br />Look at their children coming to visit<br />
<br />Inviting them home to stay, to rest<br />
<br />But your glasses cannot decrypt that puzzle</p>
