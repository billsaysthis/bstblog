<p>Many, many news reports have shown that Diebold and other voting machine vendors have performed terribly in recent elections, yet the county registrars who make the contracts for these machines have not stood up and demanded answers. Yesterday, that changed when the Alameda County Registrar <a href="http://www.timesstar.com/Stories/0,1413,125~10859~2038407,00.html">sent a formal demand for compliance</a> to Diebold demanding "deliver within 10 days a written plan to correct multiple problems." Kudos to Brad Clark for finally showing at least his citizens that at least one county is not just in the vendor's pocket!</p>
