<p><a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/b5f01a94-804f-11d9-bd50-00000e2511c8.html">Interesting change</a> in the CIA's depiction of the Chinese military capability [<span style="font-style:italic;">via <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/?p=6062">Garret</a></span>]. Fits together with a chart I tore out of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercury News</span> last week which shows national quantities of nuclear weapons superimposed on a world map; I was saving it to use in a post but really haven't had the correct hook. The bit that got my attention were the numbers for China, 300 strategic and 120 tactical, which are probably correct as far as is known outside their top military and political leadership but seem awfully low to me. Since the graphic was attached to stories about <a href="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:l-qUukmxQloJ:www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/breaking_news/10873781.htm+&amp;hl=en" title="Google cache, hopefully won't disappear behind a pat wall">the recent North Korean announcements</a> of their possession of such weapons, the other nations' numbers weren't discussed. But do any of you really believe that China, having had nukes for 40 years or so, really have so few weapons?</p>
