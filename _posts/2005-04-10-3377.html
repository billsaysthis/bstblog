<p><a href="http://www.hyperhistory.com/online_n2/History_n2/a.html">HyperHistory Online</a>, a very interesting experiment in UI design and definitely something not possible before the web; one wonders if this presentation style could be (easily) applied to a bigger data set (I'm guessing) like Wikipedia. Not that there isn't a useful quantity of information already at HHO with more added regularly but one wonders if merging would be in the best interests of both projects. Wikipedia doesn't have an article on the project so after hitting the big orange Publish Post I think I'll break my cherry by adding one. [<span style="font-style:italic;">via <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/weblog/kmartino/archives/003827.shtml">paradox1x</a></span>]</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Later:</span> Well, let's just say that for all the pages of helpful material and tutorials, creating a (good) new page on Wikipedia is less than easy. Searching again, however, shows that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=hyperhistory&amp;go=Go">several pages already mention this site</a> and so I didn't go futher than adding it to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_themed_timelines#History_2">Themed Timelines page</a>.</p>
