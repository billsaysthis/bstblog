<p>Charles Stross initially gained notoriety for the far-future novels <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/content/singlepost.php?id=111095193944318669&amp;titl=SingularitySky&amp;sy=review">Singularity Sky</a> and <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/content/singlepost.php?id=113375203470061008&amp;titl=IronSunrise&amp;sy=review">Iron Sunrise</a>, then the comic-horror <span style="font-style:italic;">Atrocity Archives</span>, the <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/content/singlepost.php?id=113998267862473633&amp;titl=TheFamilyTrade&amp;sy=review">first</a> <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/content/singlepost.php?id=114391938780908446&amp;titl=TheHiddenFamily&amp;sy=review">two</a> volumes of his medieval corporate fantasy Merchant Princes series, the positively stunning <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/content/singlepost.php?id=115337278047490926&amp;titl=Accelerando&amp;sy=review">Accelerando</a>, <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/content/singlepost.php?id=8738815765064913086&amp;titl=TheClanCorporate&amp;sy=review">Merchant Princes #3,</a> the shattered identity <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/content/singlepost.php?id=5344675405659151616&amp;titl=Glasshouse&amp;sy=review">Glasshouse</a>, an <span style="font-style:italic;">Atrocity</span> sequel, <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/content/singlepost.php?id=7825624031159272316&amp;titl=TheMerchantsWar&amp;sy=review">Merchant Princes #4</a> and now this, quite different from anything in the previous oeuvre, exploring the question of security in our immediate future.</p>
<p>The eleventh book of fiction from Stross (in little more than four years!) <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/fiction/faq.html">Halting State</a> is one of my favorite authors showing that no matter how broadly he reaches he can still deliver the goods. Just a decade from now, and taking a patch from Ian Rankin and Ken Macleod by using the Edinburgh setting as a key element, the story concerns a bank robbery. One that could not have happened even five years ago since this particular bank is inside a top tier massively multiplayer online role playing game.</p>
<p>Key characters include Sgt. Sue Smith of the Edinburgh police, forensic accountant Elaine Barnaby of Dietrich-Brunner Associates, a very capable game programmer named Jack Reed who hires on as Elaine's "native guide," several suits from the company running the in-game bank, Hayek Associates, and a smattering of coppers and related outfits. All ring real rather than cut out of a cereal box.</p>
<p>I'd rather not do any spoilers so no big plot discussion except to say Stross, not surprisingly does a good job with it and there is at least one <span style="font-style:italic;">24</span>-like complete jump change along the way. I will tell you that, the Scottish devolution wish fulfillment aside, his insights into the risks and rewards of near-term technological developments seem both very possible and frightening.</p>
<p>Charlie has two novels due in 2008, the fifth Merchant Princes novel and a standalone Heinleinesque space opera. Picture my hands rubbing in gleeful anticipation.</p>
