<p>So now I've read the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/singlepost.php?id=114291056524750904&amp;titl=Star%20Fraction,%20The&amp;sy=review">first</a>, second and <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2005_10_16_blog_archive.phtml#112969697843391126">fourth</a> novels in <a href="http://kenmacleod.blogspot.com/">Ken MacLeod's</a> <span style="font-style:italic;">Fall Revolution</span> series. Series is a good name for the books given how loosely connected the stories are, though they do share thematic explorations of post-socialist polities.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/m/ken-macleod/stone-canal.htm">The Stone Canal</a> focuses on David Reid and Jonathon Wilde, from Wilde's perspective, paralleling joint experiences on Earth pre-Singularity and a world named New Mars afterwards. The two meet at Glasgow University in 1975, the first scene set in a bar with politics the topic of discussion. Many of the scenes which have them physically together involve bars or at least alcohol. The Earth-based story skips across the decades, technology developing to lengthen lifespans far beyond what we have today, but the other half is just a few days in Ship City, the only habitation on New Mars. The only inhabitants are humans and human-gestated intelligent machines, some of whom occupy human clone bodies.</p>
<p>Negatives: Macleod poses Wilde as somewhat less discerning than you'd expect a person of his education experience to be and, in a second surprising mistake, clearly overestimates the impact of the revelation of a connection between two of the female supporting characters. I'd also prefer he left out the constant mention of cigarette smoking despite the handwaving cancer immunity.</p>
<p>The book is wildly creative and engaging though, as is the case with many second novels, works too hard to top the screaming success of the first. I can't imagine not reading <span style="font-style:italic;">Stone Canal</span>, though.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">recommended</span></p>
