<p>CNet had an <a href="http://news.com.com/BEA%27s+growing+pains/2008-7345_3-5222174.html?tag=nefd.lede">interview</a> with BEA's Alfred Chuang today and linked back to <a href="http://news.com.com/BEA+aims+for+app+server+market/2100-1001_3-216001.html?tag=nl">their story</a> when BEA's acquisition of WebLogic was announced. That article in turn links to the article about <a href="http://news.com.com/News/Item/0,4,23776,00.html">Sun's acquisition</a> weeks before of NetDynamics.</p>
<p>One of the funny memories of that time was the morning in July I came back from vacation. I asked the guy in the next cube if anything had happened while I was away and he said, casual as could be, that Sun had bought us. Since our CEO <a href="http://www.modeln.com/company/about_leadership.html" title="His new company is ModelN">Zack Rinat</a> had always told the staff that his goal was to build a billion dollar company, I had expected any acquisition news to feature us as the buyer. My boss wasn't in that early so I went over to his boss and asked for the details and <a href="http://www.echelon.com/about/whois.htm#rharris">Russ</a> confirmed it. Quite a bit of news to digest before coffee!</p>
