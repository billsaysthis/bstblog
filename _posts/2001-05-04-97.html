<p><b>This explains a lot!</b>
<p>In the current issue, The Onion explains that <a href="http://www.theonion.com/onion3716/god_diagnosed_bipolar.html">God has been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder</a>. Said Rev. Dr. Henry Jurgens, "God has His problems like anyone else, but He is essentially trying His best. He just has a condition that makes His emotions fly out of control at times." If God gets mad, I guess you won't be reading this weblog much longer...</p>
<p>They also have an amusing article on the <a href="http://www.theonion.com/onion3716/denominator_plummets.html">Lowest Common Denominator</a>.</p>
