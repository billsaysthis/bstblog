<p>A word used in the UK to describe an absolutely terrible performance by an overwhelming favorite, shambolic perfectly describes Liverpool's play as they've lost <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/match?id=153992&amp;cc=5901">0-1 to Manchester United</a>, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=169993&amp;cc=5901">1-0 to Burnley</a> to crash out of the FA Cup, and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=154067&amp;cc=5901">2-0 to Southampton</a> in the last week, after barely hanging on for a <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=169861&amp;cc=5901">1-0 win over Watford</a> a few days earlier in the first leg of their Carling Cup semifinal.</p>
<p>These results are especially disheartening after the Reds did as well as could be expected in their four previous matches, taking three wins and nine points out of four holiday week outings with the only loss 0-1 to league leaders Chelsea on a late, lucky goal by Joe Cole. The team had driven up from middle of the pack to fifth place after that stretch and with Everton's recent poor form and their sale of team leader Thomas Graveson to Real Madrid one could see some light ahead in the reaching a Champions League spot tunnel.</p>
<p>One could look at the loss to ManU and not be too upset (other than at Jerzy Dudek) because of the decent overall form and effort added to a questionable call or two from the referee. Losing to lower division Burnley was not so easily dismissed, the only score was the own goal by Traore playing out of position at center back; Benitez's stated need to rest some starters that day can be argued with as he should have waited until the Carling Cup return leg this Tuesday at Watford to do it.</p>
<p>Today our manager had little in the way of excuses. Especially questionable was his selection of new signing Mauricio Pellegrino in central defense over Jamie Carragher, whose partnership with Sami Hyypia has really blossomed in the last two months. Pellegrino clearly lacked the necessary fitness and understanding of the differences between La Liga and EPL play and he left a huge whole in our back line that botttom dwellers Saints exploited for their first win in ten league matches. After a terrible clearance attempt, Southampton's David Prutton beat Dudek just inside the near post in the 5th minute and we never recovered--I'm hard pressed to recall one single difficult save we forced Antti Niemi to make before halftime (though looking at the match report there were a couple). Another breakdown, in the 22nd minute, gave the Saints their 2-0 lead.</p>
<p>Our pace and execution improved in the second half but even the addition of recent hot scorer Florent Sinama-Pongolle out to the right in place of the less adventurous Stephen Warnock couldn't help us get past their keeper. A number of good chances by Morientes, Riise and Baros were wasted. Steven Gerrard, so often the hero when no one else gets motoring, had nothing until very late and wasn't able to take the team on his back.</p>
<p>Making matters worse, Hyypia had to leave in the 67th minute after suffering a twisted hip; five first team regulars (plus often-featured Valdimir Smicer) are already on the longterm injury list but losing the former captain for any substantial number of matches could put paid to the chances of ending in the Top Four. Giving hope despite this is the generally poor form by most of the competing squads. Two surely dangling questions lingering: After today's two goals is how long Benitez will wait to give Scott Carson, the young keeper signed two days ago from Leeds, a chance? And, is the club done for January or will they take further action before the transfer window closes?<br /></p>
