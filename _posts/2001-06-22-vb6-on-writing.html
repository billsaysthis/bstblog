<p>After turning out nearly three dozen fiction bestsellers, <a href="http://www.stephenking.com/">Steven King</a> recently wrote a non-fiction book on a topic he knows so well. <a href="http://www.simonsays.com/subs/book.cfm?areaID=21&amp;isbn=0671024256" title="includes an excerpt">On Writing</a> isn't a long book, nor is it obnoxiously short. The book is part memoir, to show us what life events and influences got him going, and part important rules for writers.</p>
<p>I quite enjoyed this book although I've only read one of King's novels (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Stand</span>) all the way through. He writes in a breezy, friendly style. I took it as meaning, hey, this works for me, why not see if any or all does you any good.</p>
<p>        King doesn't spend much ink retelling what <a href="http://www.strunkandwhite.com/">Strunk and White</a> covered so well but does strongly recommend that writers become familiar with that book. He's also extremely anti-adverb while admitting that he can't always force himself to remove all the adverbs that somehow still end up in first drafts, even after all these years.</p>
