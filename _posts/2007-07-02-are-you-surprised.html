<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSWAT00783220070702">Bush commutes Libby's prison sentence</a>. "He will remain on probation. The significant fines [$250,000] imposed by the judge will remain in effect," Bush said. "The consequences of his felony conviction on his former life as a lawyer, public servant, and private citizen will be long-lasting."</p>
<p>Odd that Bush thinks substituting his judgment for that of the court's is acceptable after the fuss his side have made about personal responsibility and respect for law. You can't tell me there aren't wealthy supporters who haven't already stepped up to pay this trivial (for a wealthy person) fine and make sure Libby is taken care of if that's needed.</p>
