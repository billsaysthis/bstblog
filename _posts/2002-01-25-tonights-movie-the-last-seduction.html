<p>I can't find the webpage but yesterday I read a complaint by someone that there aren't any great female villainous roles. Then I saw 1994's <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0110308">Last Seduction</a> on the schedule for HBO tonight and said to myself, "Self, don't you remember that <a href="http://us.imdb.com/EGallery?source=granitz&amp;group=1146&amp;photo=fiorentino_linda2&amp;path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Fiorentino,+Linda">Linda Fiorentino</a> plays an incredibly bad, amoral woman in that flick?" So I watched just to make sure. And sure enough, Self was right. Fiorentino plays a woman who just wants to live the good life in Manhattan and has a sexy enough body and devious enough mind to get Bill Pullman and Peter Berg to do what's needed for her to get there. Drug deals, welshing on loan sharks, murder, nothing is going to stand in her way.</p>
<p>Excellent script by Steve Barancik, whose only other credited script is for the upcoming Samuel Jackson thriller "No Good Deed" also features a manipulative female lead (the also slender, small breasted, sexy Milla Jovovich). Good pacing and direction from John Dahl, he really gets performances from the leads as well as Bill Nunn and J.T. Walsh. Much better than anything Dahl's done since, unfortunately. But this one is highly recommended.</p>
