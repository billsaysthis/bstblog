<p><b>Enterprise: this show's a keeper</b></p>
<p>Watched it, loved it, you must tune in next week. <a href="http://www.startrek.com/launch/default.asp">Enterprise</a> has the goods and this time around franchise chiefs Rick Berman and Brannon Braga have put a lot of thought into setting up a seven year run. With <a href="http://www.star-trek-voyager.fsnet.co.uk/">Voyager</a>, for example, there reportedly was internal debate right up until the beginning of the last season over whether, when, and how the lost crew would get back to Earth. Deep Space Nine had a great multi-year run with the <a href="http://www.psiphi.org/DS9/ep/mp-525.html">Dominion War</a> but this was not planned at the beginning. In this show, we are get (what will likely be) the major story line right in the first episode: the temporal cold war with the alien Suleiban as key enemies fronting for a far-future leader who we won't get detailed information on until next season at the earliest. <em>COOL!!!</em></p>
