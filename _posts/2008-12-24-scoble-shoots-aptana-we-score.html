<p>I earned my paycheck for yesterday by inviting the <a href="http://friendfeed.com/scobleizer">web's greatest connector</a>, Robert Scoble, to our office to shoot video about Aptana Cloud and Aptana Studio. His blog post about the visit is titled <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/12/24/the-best-2009-web-development-tool/">The best 2009 web development tool?</a>, which gives you guidance on his reaction. Thanks Robert!</p>
<p>Shunning the spotlight myself, instead the stars are Kevin Hakman, our Director of Evangelism, and Kris Rassmussen, Cloud lead.</p>
<p>[Sorry, had to delete the videos due to issue with the Kyte.tv video player]</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Note:</span> Titles at Aptana are a bit different. For instance, I'm the only person with the word Manager--and Kevin is the only one with Director--in his or her title. Kris, as an engineering lead, is theoretically the equivalent of a senior manager or possibly director. I just felt more comfortable with the more traditional title since the rest of it, the team name portion, is very non-standard: Customer Success.</p>
