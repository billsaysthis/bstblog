<p>More precisely, Dylan's <a href="http://bobdylan.com">own website</a>. A very nice example of how to be fan friendly without going overboard. In contrast to, say, <a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/">Springsteen</a>, Dylan <a href="http://bobdylan.com/performances/">posts</a> complete streaming versions of songs that he's performing in concert; he did <a href="http://bobdylan.com/audio/live/bd/something_111302.ram" title="Real Audio link">Something</a> as a tribute to George Harrison the other night and it's up on the site already, as well as current tour versions of Zevon's <a href="http://bobdylan.com/audio/live/bd/mutineer_101102.ram">Mutineer</a> and Henley's <a href="http://bobdylan.com/audio/live/bd/innocence_101502.ram">The End of the Innocence</a>.</p>
<p>Bruce has clips of each of the songs on his current album but that's it. To judge by his website, you'd almost think The Rising is his first release--there's absolutely zero mention of any of his prior albums. Hell, Dylan's site has a page that allows one to search for songs based on lyrics! Both sites have links labelled "Discussion", presumably message boards, but neither page would open for me in Crazy Browser, had to slip back to IE to view. Didn't really check Dylan's but for Bruce I think the main Usenet newsgroup, rec.music.artists.springsteen is better.</p>
