<p><b>Kissing Lessons</b>
<p>I am a veteran, inverterate kisser, having been at it for almost 30 years now (perhaps more if you consider those busses in the closet with Joanie when I was eight) but when I saw a link to <a href="http://love.msn.com/articles/article11.asp">Kissing Perfection</a>, I had to check it out. Amazingly, the article entertained even if there was nothing new to me. In case you're not sure, it lists the "kiss me now" messages a woman sends when it's that time; this is good, so women know what to do so we will kiss them. The article says no tongue on the first kiss but I say go with the spirit!</p>
