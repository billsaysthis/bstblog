<p>One of my good friends and I disagree about the intentions and aspirations (that seems like a fair way to express it) of the Bush Administration and its allies. I see creeping fascism--and I use that word after careful consideration, something my friend challenged me on--almost everywhere I look. But sometimes The Powers That Be don't even attempt to hide their actions and we get a good look, as can be seen in the decision by media conglomerate Viacom <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/11/04/cbs.reagans.ap/">to move The Reagans</a> from CBS to Showtime.</p>
<p>The government can't revoke the license of Showtime, since a pay cable network doesn't need one, nor can advertisers pull their money away (ditto). Executives claim that the two networks have different broadcast standards but that seems like a load of hooey to this observer--we're not talking about nudity (yeccch! Ronnie and Nancy naked?!?!?!) or foul language but the alleged historical accuracy of a program that is <em>not</em> advertised as a documentary.</p>
<p>The dictionary.com definition of fascism includes this aspect: "suppression of the opposition through ... censorship." Where, one might ask, is the pressure coming from that's causing this decision by Viacom? "The <a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/entertainment/7180006.htm">chairman of the Republican National Committee</a> also told CBS President Leslie Moonves that historians should review the miniseries for historical accuracy, or that a disclaimer should be run declaring the program fiction." So look closely, because we rarely get to see the mechanisms exposed so clearly.</p>
