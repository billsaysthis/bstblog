<p>Man, the skies were grey, dark and threatening all morning, barely a hint of blue off somewhere, but not until just now did the rain start coming down. And when I say coming down, I mean like in big buckets of little invisible man in the sky piss with a supersized side order of windy. Like the old Snoopy world's worst story opening sentence: "It was a dark and stormy night..." except that it's only 3:20 in the afternoon here.</p>
