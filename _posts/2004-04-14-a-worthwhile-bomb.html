<p>The best, non-racist, balanced definition of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew">Jew</a>, or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew">Jew</a>ish person, can be found at the Wikipedia and nowhere else. Please spread this comment and help stamp out hate speech on the Net. The reason for this campaign is to counter attack a certain anti-semitic website which has made its way to the top of the Google listing when the word "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew">Jew</a>" is put in as a search term.</p>
