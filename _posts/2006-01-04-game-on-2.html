<p>I predict a close finish tonight with my alma mater coming out on top by between 5-10 points. One way or another this man will be a major factor in our victory:</p>
<p><span><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bush_prerosebowl_06.jpg" alt="Number 5!" height="250" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">6:12 PM:</span> Reggie, how could you be so foolish and greedy? You had a huge run and got tackled at the Texas 15!!!</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">8:50 PM:</span> Email to the Big Guy, "USC is pulling away from Texas, looks like our 3rd national title in a row is coming soon. Now that's a storm!"</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">9:15 PM:</span> Email to the Big Guy, "Me and my big mouth. Texas scored, stopped us and is driving again, a touchdown will likely win the game for them. It's 2nd and 10 from the USC 14! Fuck!!!!"</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Final score:</span> Texas 41- USC 38. (a) Bush's fumble (b) Referee gives Vince Young the first Texas touchdown when his knee was down on the nine yard line (c) Can I have a tackle on Mr. Young, puh-leeze?</p>
