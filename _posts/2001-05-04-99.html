<p><b>Today's Book: Inherit the Earth</b>
<p>Brian Stableford has created a rich world beginning a couple of hundred years from now in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812584295/qid=988998757/sr=1-4/ref=sc_b_5/002-7674633-1804042" title="Amazingly, I couldn't find an author site or anything on the publisher's site to link to!">Inherit the Earth</a>. Not bad, although the ending is a little weak and has too much talking rather than action. In this world, people live healthy, pain-free, longer lives due to improved technology and the petty conflicts of nation-states have been wiped from the board by megacorps. Into this scene, kidnappings, murders, and propoganda are used by rivals to make sure the future goes their way. More than one character observes that the post of God seems vacant and the character is <i>reluctantly</i> willing to fill it. First book of a trilogy, by the way, and I'm reading the second (Architects of Emortality) now.</p>
