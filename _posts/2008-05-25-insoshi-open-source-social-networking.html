<p>What seems like a long time ago but is really less than two and a half years I went down to Pasadena for one of the first Ruby on Rails classes from Mike Clark and Dave Thomas of <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/">Pragmatic Studios</a>. While there I met <a href="http://michaelhartl.com/resume.html">Michael Hartl</a>, at the time working as a consultant at CalTech and IdeaLab but interested in doing his own thing soon.</p>
<p>We kept in touch and I was very happy last Summer when the book he co-authored, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321480791">RailsSpace: Building a Social Networking Website with Ruby on Rails</a>, came out.</p>
<p>Michael and his good friend Long Nguyen continued working the book's ideas on social networking and in December were selected to participate in the Winter 2008 <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> program for startups.</p>
<p><a href="http://insoshi.com/">Insoshi</a> is the product they're creating. The vision is to create a complete open source social networking platform, a Facebook in a box to put it crudely. The programming language is Ruby on Rails running against MySQL or SQLite by default; Rails has taken a bit of a battering in the last few months but for certain types of web apps (including this one!) I think it's still a great choice.</p>
<p>At this stage, less than two months after the initial developer release, Insoshi is very basic: profiles, friends, private messaging, forums, blogs, activity and mini feeds. Even so the structure is solid, with a strong application design, and Long and Michael are clear about the feature roadmap while remaining very open to community feedback.</p>
<p>I've set up a development instance and hope to contribute some user experience improvements based on what I've learned from <a href="http://commadot.com/">Glen Lipka</a>, Marketo's guru. The co-creators, by their own admission, are much better at coding than UX/UI so this seems like a good area for me to add value.</p>
