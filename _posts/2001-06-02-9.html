<p><b>Zep News: Plant to record solo album</b><br />

<p>Led Zeppelin lead singer Robert Plant is going <a href="http://music.yahoo.com/music/news/sonicnet/story.html?a=n/music/news/sonicnet/rock/20010601/2/p1&amp;b=n/music/news/sonicnet/rock/20010601/2/p2">back into the studio</a> with a collection of younger musicians who've played in bands such as the Cure, Portishead, and Sin√©ad O'Connor. Quite a different approach than the one taken last year by Zep guitarist <a href="http://www.sonicnet.com/artists/biography/13784.jhtml">Jimmy Page</a>, who hooked up with the Black Crowes for a tour and <a href="http://www.sonicnet.com/artists/ai_album_desc.jhtml?a_id=254001">live album</a>. Page and the Crowes played mostly Zeppelin music with singer Chris Robinson doing his best Plant imitations (after spending most of his career trying to sound like Mick Jagger). While Plant is playing some Zep material, he also plans on some other covers (such as "Hey Joe" made famous by <a href="http://www.jimi-hendrix.com/">Jimi Hendrix</a>) and some originals. While Page and Plant are playing together later this summer for one gig, there are no recording or touring plans.</p>
