<p>Major upsets are fun when you're rooting against the favorites and for many reasons I generally root against the Patriots so the Giants victory tonight was a nailbiting pleasure. Of course I grew up in New Jersey and was a huge Giants fan and USC alum/rookie receiver Steve Smith was a key offensive weapon, so there's that too.</p>
<p>I also enjoyed the unusually fast pace of the game; NFL games in general and playoffs especially are excruciatingly slow but tonight the first and third quarters barely took 30 minutes and the game ended around 40 minutes earlier than expected. That means besides the Patriots, the Giants also handed a big L to Fox and Rupert Murdoch.</p>
<p>Sweet!</p>
