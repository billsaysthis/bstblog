<p><b>Someone else's work hell</b></p>
<p>Not for a moment did I ever think the stress and pain we went through after the Sun acquisition was unique, but I have never seen a similar experience written up quite so well as Jeff does in <a href="http://www.platypus.ro/jeff/hell.html">hell</a>. Be sure you read the two paragraphs the author has formatted in extra-tiny font size.</p>
