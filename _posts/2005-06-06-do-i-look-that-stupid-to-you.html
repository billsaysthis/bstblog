<p>Having an extreme virus attack the last few days. The software's catching them, no problem, but I'm pretty freaking annoyed already. Just had five of the messages while typing that last sentence. They're all supposed to look like stern problem warnings from the manager of my domain's email system but why the real writer thinks I'd open a zip file to find out the problem is beyond me. The flood started four or five days ago, I just hope it ends soon.</p>
