<p>But are network TV commercial breaks getting longer lately? I try and use Tivo as much as possible to at least start watching 10 minutes or so into an hour show but it isn't always possible. Tonight, for instance, I'm watching <span style="font-style:italic;">Heroes</span> in a hotel room and the breaks seem just endless. More on why I'm in a hotel room another time, though it isn't for any bad reason...</p>
