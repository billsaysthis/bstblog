<p>Apparently not only is our President never wrong, he must always be celebrated: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/03/politics/03letter.html?ex=1262494800&amp;en=a09529af53164b65&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">'Pony Up' and Then 'Party On,' Inaugural Officials Say</a>. So much for showing <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_12_26_blog_archive.phtml#110443071933041648">good taste</a> or even empathy by our Administration. Perhaps celebrated isn't quite the right word, perhaps venerated is more what he wants...</p>
