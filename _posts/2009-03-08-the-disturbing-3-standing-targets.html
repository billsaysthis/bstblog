<p>Lines of supporters snake past the turnstiles<br />Boldly shouting club chants across each other<br />Waving colorful pennants and angry fists<br />Pounding out a rhythm everybody knows.</p>
<p>Players are out on the field warming up<br />Cameramen line up shots of the goals and benches<br />Kids climb over their seats, waving at friends<br />Hands sticky from pop and candy, happy.</p>
<p>Physios set out rolls of tape and extra shinguards<br />Helpers get trays of bottled water and towels<br />Announcers and color commentators jabber,<br />Rushing to scribble final notes and thoughts.</p>
<p>Louder than the fan's cheers the starting whistle reigns<br />The referee's arm comes down and the players jump<br />Home supporters shouting again, traveling fans<br />Hold their own, altogether shaking the stands.</p>
<p>Action races up the pitch with the ball flitting,<br />Wing to mid to fullback to striker to wing, defender<br />Jumping in to disrupt the play, bounding the ball<br />Off a leg, off the field and into the technical area.</p>
