<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/rss/redir/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20040415.html">Cringely's latest</a> is definitely of interest to the Sun and ex-Sun community. One point he doesn't make, though I suppose implies, takes the form of a question: Can you name the last innovation at Sun that has made the company money? I mean even pure revenue, not just gross margin or EBITDA. If you say N1 I will say that it's (a) a marketecture and (b) not actually shipping (<a href="http://www.sun.com/products/">here is the Sun products page</a>, tell me which of the listed items is N1).</p>
