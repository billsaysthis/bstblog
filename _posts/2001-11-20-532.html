<p><b>CIA goes military?</b></p>
<p>I remember reading about the CIA and assorted military or quasi-military events back in the day (LOL, ain't I hip?) or at least back in the '50s and '60s, before they got busted in the wake of Watergate. I don't ever remember reading, though, that the Company had formed an actual military unit. Now, apparently, that has changed and this unit, the Special Activities Staff, is leading the way in <a href="http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;$sessionid$I5ZKDBYAAAN1XQFIQMFSFFOAVCBQ0IV0?xml=/news/2001/11/20/wbin20.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2001/11/20/ixhome.html">closing in on bin Laden</a>. Not really sure how I feel about the news of this group though. I wonder why the CIA needs this capability, instead of just working with an appropriately trained, staffed, and equipped company from the Marines or the Army.</p>
