<p>Bush is disturbed by the ongoing issuance of marriage licenses to same sex couples in San Francisco. I realize these marriages are a terrible imposition to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/">the Stupidator</a> all the way in D.C. but dude, what the fuck? Your office releases a report on jobs so filled with bullshit even you can't keep the gorge down long enough to sell it. Your own office, dude! Let's consider the priorities of your job again, this time a little more carefully, and then you tell me which problems the President of the United States ought to be focusing his energy and attention on. M'kay?</p>
