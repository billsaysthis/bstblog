<p>What a lazy slow day it's been. After a tasty breakfast from Viv's Cafe, I dropped TS1 off at the trains so she could go and be a good little consumer up at <a href="http://www.ci.sanmateo.ca.us/business/comctrsdwntn.html">Hillsdale Shopping Center</a>. The Morning Coffee Walk was, as usual, intellectually stimulating and not only because of the caffeine. Then things got slow. Sort of half watched the TiVoed <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=108570&amp;cc=5901" title="Tim, how could you let in that second goal?">ManUre-Everton EPL match</a> but I knew the outcome which killed much of the interest and I spent most of the second half surfing, mainly on <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com">Ask MetaFilter</a>. Glad to read, of course, that the Reds were able to take care of business with Bolton and get their own 3-1 victory.</p>
<p>Couldn't wait any longer for lunch, around 1:00, even having had a little snack about 11 and knowing that TS1 was only minutes away from home. So I gave into my hunger and scarfed some of the delicious leftover ribs that Viv's Cafe served lst night... yummy. For that snack I had an <a href="http://www.easadvantedge.com/products/adv_shakes_carb_control.asp">EAS AdvantEdge Carb Control</a> low carb drink which was part of a low carb basket Xmas gift from one of TS1's co-workers. Not bad tasting compared to the Atkins version, especially compared to the version one mixes up from the powder.</p>
<p>The next couple of hours are mostly a blur as a post-lunch coma kicked in and out as I was watching the <a href="http://www.motorcitybowl.com/">Motor City Bowl</a>. Finally emerged from it around 3:30 and spent the last 75 minutes finishing off <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380788284/103-7509690-9586264?v=glance">Semper Mars</a>, the first book in <em>The Heritage Trilogy</em>, by <a href="http://users.stargate.net/~whkeith/">Ian Douglas</a> (although not, apparently, <a href="http://www.iandouglas.com/">this Ian Douglas</a> because this book's author is <a href="http://users.stargate.net/~whkeith/htm/pen.htm" title="On the linked page he explains why">using a nom de plume</a> and is really called William Keith). I epxect to finish the other two before adding a writeup here.</p>
