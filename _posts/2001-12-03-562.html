<p><strong>Saturday's movie: Bridget Jones' Diary</strong></p>
<p>A definite <a href="http://www.miramax.com/bridgetjonesdiary/">chick flick</a>. Amusingly, the producers felt there was no English actress capable of playing what was arguably the juiciest English female role in several decades and so we have <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Zellweger,+Ren%E9e">Rene Zellweger</a> doing a totally cute English accent. Of course, I've always had a little something for her, after such cool flicks as Nurse Betty, Empire Records, and even Jerry Maguire. Hugh Grant (sweet, smarmy, and of course unredeemable) and Colin Firth (overcool English reserve but a beautiful heart) have no problems in playing to character as the male romantic leads. Zellweger gained 20 pounds, drinks and smokes constantly in the film, and surely catching every eye with some of the outfits she wears--particularly the panties, tiny tee, sneakers, and robe she wears in one scene while running out into the snowy evening. Nice first time directing job by Sharon Maguire. Funny and sweet, recommended for watching as a couple especially on a rainy or snowy winter night.</p>
