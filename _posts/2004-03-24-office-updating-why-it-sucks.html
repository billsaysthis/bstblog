<p>All you Microsoft Bloggers, please explain to me why updating Office requires the original CD in the drive. And when it's there, why does the installer fail to find it, ask repeatedly for it and then when I tell the installer the original disk is right where the supplied dialog suggests it ought to be, it takes forever to see it?</p>
<p>And an Outlook spam filter request: how about an option to  mark all mail <em>to</em> a given address or from any sender in an entire top level domain (that is, anything from .ru or .kr), or as junk?</p>
