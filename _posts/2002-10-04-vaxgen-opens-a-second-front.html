<p>Vaxgen executives knew that, as promising as it will be in the next few years, their AIDSVAX AIDS vaccine alone is not enough to build a successful company. The two top managers, CEO Lance Gordon and President Donald P. Francis, are seasoned researchers in the field of seriously nasty viruses so they went out and <a href="http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=VXGN&amp;script=410&amp;layout=-6&amp;item_id=340579">won a contract</a> from the US Government to develop and supply an anthrax vaccine. Which has given the stock price a nice boost over the last few days, from a low of $8.35 Tuesday to today's close of $10.40 even though the NASDAQ Composite has continued down. Though this is nothing compared to what the stock price will be after AIDSVAX passes the last clinical trials early next year and gets FDA approval.</p>
