<p><b>Could MS do HomeStation if it was split up?</b></p>
<p>PC Format, a UK home computing magazine, has a <a href="http://www.pcformat.co.uk/news/detail.asp?id=30803">world scoop on the Microsoft HomeStation</a>. And Flangy, an MS employee, <a href="http://theflangynews.editthispage.com/2001/09/07">appears to confirm</a>. What is HomeStation? Microsoft's idea of a home entertainment hub, a combination XBox/PC, with heavy duty <a href="http://www.nvidia.com">graphics</a> and <a href="http://www.dolby.com">sound</a>. You'll hook it up to your TV, cable modem or DSL connection, digital camera, PDA, and telephone. It will include <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ultimatetv/">personal video recorder</a> functionality. It will be able to play XBox and PC games and run on WindowsXP. And it will make heavy use of Microsoft's .NET servers and services.</p>
<p>Curiously, David Banks in <a href="http://www.breakingwindows.net">Breaking Windows</a> is quite clear that one of Bill Gates' most fundamental principles is the separation of hardware and software and now he's going to break that a second time. Has the world changed that much?</p>
<p>What I'd like to know is how some obscure British pub had this story before the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">major</a> <a href="http://www.news.com">tech</a> <a href="http://www.zdnet.com">sources</a>?</p>
