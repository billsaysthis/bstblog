<p>Two new dates for the Summer Stadium Swing: Saturday, Aug. 16, at Pac Bell Park and the next night at Dodger Stadium in LA. Tickets go <a href="http://ticketmaster.com">on sale</a> Monday morning (July 28) at 10 a.m. and TS1 and I are going to be trying for a pair of seats, you better believe it! Just look at the <a href="http://discussions.brucespringsteen.net/thread.jsp?forum=32&amp;thread=58493">set list</a> from his show last night at Giants Stadium: <em>Jackson Cage</em>, <em>For You</em> in a full band treatment, <em>No Surrender</em>, and <em>Spirit In The Night</em> with original E Streeter Vinnie Lopez on drums. <strong>Oh Yeah!</strong></p>
