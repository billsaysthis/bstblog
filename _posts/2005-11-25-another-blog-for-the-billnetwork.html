<p>Though I wish WordPress had better/easier multi-blog support, there's no time like now to add another blog to my expanding one man empire. So I give you <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/movies/">Bill's Movie Reviews</a>, stocked with over 350 writeups for your edification. The categories need some work, which they'll get over the weekend, and we saw <a href="http://harrypotter.warnerbros.com/gobletoffire/index.html">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a> today so it even has a <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/movies/2005/11/harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire">new posting</a> to say hello.</p>
