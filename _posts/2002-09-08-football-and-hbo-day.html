<p>The NFL is back. Watched the Jets squeeze past the Bills, when their defense barely made it possible, and fellow USC alum Chad Morton did the impossible, running back two kick returns for touchdowns, including the winner.</p>
<p>Also, set up a blog for a friend who shall remain nameless (at least for the time being).</p>
<p>Will be watching the season finales of Sex and the City and The Wire later.</p>
