<p><b>Today's task: site update</b></p>
<p>Another milestone in the billsaysthis redesign. Every page conforms to a standard, structured layout that include the top row elements (logo, page title or saying on the home page, and site search), site navigation bar along the left side, and the page's individual content occupying the remainder. Used modular programming in <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> to get this and hopefully future design changes will not require updating every single page. I know that a <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/">content management system</a> would also get to this point with less work from me but part of the reason for doing the site is to do my own programming and not use a <a href="http://www.postnuke.com">package</a></p>
