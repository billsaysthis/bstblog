<p>Dave W. has finally had enough and <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1510">kicked WinerLog</a> off his EditThisPage.com service. On the other hand, <a href="http://metatalk.metafilter.com/mefi/1728#24007">Dave also claims</a> he hasn't shut them down. Even WinerLog <a href="http://winerlog.editthispage.com/2002/01/29">says they have not been shut down</a> but are simply frustrated with the free service. In any case, Zaphod and gang aren't going far. They found a <a href="http://winerlog.weblogger.com/">new home</a> at Userland partner Weblogger.com and are still using Manila. I suppose there will be some transitional issues with their archives but you can't keep a good blogger down!</p>
