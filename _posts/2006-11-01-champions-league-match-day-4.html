<p>ESPN gave us two decent games live this week, despite both turning out to be 0-0 results, Bayern Munich-Sporting and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/6094152.stm">Arsenal-CSKA Moscow</a>. The latter was probably one of the best scoreless matches I've seen, in fact, with Arsenal pounding over 20 shots and the Russian champions far fewer but working the counter-attacks like a silver mine.</p>
<p>The Londoners ought to have won 3-1 but for two things: terrible--and terribly unlucky--final touches and several brilliant saves from 20 year old keeper Igor Akinfeev. van Persie, Henry, Fabregas, Hleb and Rosicky all had opportunities that should have been scores. Going the other way, CSKA's all-Brazilian frontline tested Jens Lehman a few times and caused some shouting between Lehman and his center backs.</p>
<p>Moscow clearly had the better in this home and away, winning the home leg 1-0, and now top their group on eight points while Arsenal will need results in the final two group matches. Yesterday's match in Germany was much less exciting; the hosts seemed to think the three points were their's for the showing up while the Portuguese side couldn't break down a harsh backline.</p>
<p>The Livepool game with Bordeaux didn't make it on air but the Reds ruled their home ground. Two goals from Luis Garcia and one from the inimitable Captain Gerrard made for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/6094112.stm">a 3-0 victory</a> that puts them ahead of PSV Eindhoven on goal difference, with both sides qualifying for the knockout stages. The group leaders meet at Anfield in three weeks and if one comes away with a win they'll likely have the benefit of finishing first.</p>
