<p><b>MTV President Judy McGrath is wanted for the murder of music</b></p>
<p>Matt Drudge is a man with opinions and he's never been afraid to let them out. But <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/jm.htm">this time</a> he really let's loose on Judy McGrath. My only comment is that I don't watch MTV and haven't for awhile except for the occasional Celebrity Deathmatch; shows like TRL and Jackass are just over my head. Sample quotes from Drudge:</p>
<p>"Long after we rip out the infected pierced stud in our tongues and wash off all our tats and forget we ever witnessed three-and-a-half-hours of something called The Eighteenth Annual MTV Video Music Awards... we'll possibly be able to look at ourselves in the mirror again."</p>
<p>"THANKS TO EVERYONE WHO THOUGHT WE WOULD MAKE GOOD WHORES."</p>
<p>"McGrath, a star in the VIACOMCBS family, knew she had hit the Zeitgeist with promos for the "Music Awards" which featured host Jamie Foxx simulating intercourse with a live sheep. You could almost hear McGrath applaud, cheer and order heavy rotation as Foxx gyrated his pelvis into the sheep."</p>
<p>Drudge is not the only one catching on... Eric Boehlert in Salon gives us <a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/music/feature/2001/09/07/mtv_awards/index.html?CP=RDF&amp;DN=310">Rock stars for sale!</a> and <a href="http://www.curry.com">Adam Curry</a>, original VJ and now <a href="http://www.curry.com/stories/storyReader$28">Web entrepreneur</a>, is always good for a gut shot.</p>
