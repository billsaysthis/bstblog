<p>In the 79th minute, Kleberson sends a pass along the top of the 18 yard box, Rivaldo allowed the ball to go through his legs to Ronaldo, who took one touch to settle and then went all the way to the other side of the goal. Khan stretched out as long as he could but that wasn't far enough as it rolled into the netting; the German goalie clearly seems to be hurt from an earlier collision. But Ronaldo has now tied the greatest scorer of all time and the South Americans seem sure to lift their fifth trophy.</p>
