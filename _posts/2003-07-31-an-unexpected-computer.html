<p>Now is not really a great time for me to buy a new PC, you know why, but nonetheless I found myself at Fry's early this afternoon doing just that. I got a sweet little machine, a shade off the leading edge (which would be a Toshiba S507, I think), in the form of a Toshiba A15. Littlesteven, as it's been named, has 512MB of RAM, built-in WiFi, CD-RW/DVD-ROM and a very sharp screen. My 30 month old Sony Vaio was apparently about ready to give up the ghost according to Norton System Doctor, hence the earlier than expected expenditure and an all day exercise in installing and configuring software. Still need to install Office and copy over music files but all good otherwise. Ah well.</p>
