<p>To the Mercury News, in regards to a Letter printed today <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/opinion/8103125.htm">written by an election field inspector</a>:</p>
<p>Janis Lassner writes from an informed but biased position regarding her experience with Tuesday's voting process. While I would not question her veracity, she conflates her limited anecdotal experience with statistically valid evidence. Further, her observation that using the machines is "fast, fun and easy" for many voters in no way addresses the security issues that many researchers have found.</p>
<p>I do agree with Ms. Lassner that the Mercury News should expand coverage of this issue, though, and would especially appreciate articles that look at open source projects like (http://open-vote.org/) Open Vote Foundation. and (http://www.openvotingconsortium.org/) Open Voting Consortium. Only when the voting public can examine the source code and hardware designs used in our voting machines will we truly be able to trust the results.</p>
