<p>This is a simple, very low carb vegetable side dish, prepared in a wok, that I made a couple of days ago. This quantity feeds four or five and goes well with steak or BBQ chicken. Feel free to vary the level of garlic but remember the old saying: "You can never eat enough garlic."</p>
<p><em>Ingredients</em>
<ul>
<li>4 bunches of <a href="http://www.vegweb.com/glossary/docs/bokchoy.shtml">bok choy</a><br />
</li>
<li>5-6 cloves of garlic<br />
</li>
<li>1 lb of button mushrooms (feel free to substitute more exotic varieties)<br />
</li>
<li>1 tbsp sesame oil<br />
</li>
<li>2-3 tbsp soy sauce<br />
</li>
<li>1 tsp ground oregano or basil (or both)<br />
</li>
<li>olive oil<br />
</li>
<li>fresh ground pepper (to taste)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Preparation</em>
<ul>
<li>Cut off the bottom of each bunch of the bok choy, separate the stalks, cut the leafy green tops off the stems; wash and dry thoroughly<br />
</li>
<li>Smash and chop the garlic<br />
</li>
<li>Cut mushrooms into thin slices</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cooking</em>
<ul>
<li>Heat skillet over medium flame, then add oil<br />
</li>
<li>Add bok choy stems and stir, thoroughly coating with oil, about 60 seconds<br />
</li>
<li>Add garlic, stir in and soften<br />
</li>
<li>Add soy sauce and grind in pepper, stir another minute or so<br />
</li>
<li>Add mushrooms, herbs, and keep stirring, until mushrooms appear light brown and very soft<br />
</li>
<li>Add bok choy leaves and stir thoroughly to coat but only for 45-60 seconds until leave barely begin to wilt and remove from heat</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a pretty basic garlic veggie recipe and you can substitute other green veggies such as spinach, broccoli, green beans, or Chinese broccoli for variety.</p>
<p><em>Enjoy!</em></p>
