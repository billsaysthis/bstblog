<p><b>Another L&amp;O beauty hits the bricks</b>
<p>What is it about top TV show <a href="http://www.studiosusa.com/laworder/">Law and Order</a> and it's assistant district attorneys? In 10 years, the show has gone through at least five of them. Yesterday, <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010410/en/television-laworder_1.html">Angie Harmon</a> became the latest to leave "Law &amp; Order." Fortunately, the show itself rolls on, as good as ever and has already been renewed until 2005.</p>
