<p>"This is driving me insane and making me curse. Why oh why do you have to hurt me like this?"</p>
<p>I am so, so sad that poor little Blogger has done this damage to your psyche! Or is it possible that someone is taking their blog just a little too seriously?</p>
<p>I know, I know! The guy just wants faster service, to move up in the queue ahead of users who filed problem reports before he did, so he's trying to show us how badly he needs help. Of course, given the backlog and my recent start at tackling it, this particular request was filed three weeks. Somehow the user seemed to get past his insanity and even solve his own problem (probably he just waited it out, a little time seems to cure many Blogger ills) since he's posted numerous times since then.</p>
