<p><b>America: It's good to be here</b></p>
<p>Maybe it's the medicine, maybe it's the hokey flagraising but I really felt proud and happy to be an American while listening to Jewel (what a gorgeous woman!) sing the national anthem just now during the World Series game 1 preshow. Earlier, I was reading about some of the <a href="http://www.thefire.org/issues/terror.php3">usual stupidity</a> and <a href="http://latimes.com/news/local/la-000085192oct26.story">idiocy</a> that Steven <a href="http://denbeste.nu/entries/00001208.shtml">pointed</a> <a href="http://denbeste.nu/entries/00001209.shtml">out</a> and was bumming about my compatriots. But I got a chill watching some of our military unfurl a huge American flag in the outfield and the color guards from the Phoenix police and fire departments carry more flags, and then there is <a href="http://jeweljk.tzo.com/Jewel/Photos/Magazine/011.shtml">Jewel</a> in that great t-shirt.</p>
<p>And Bernie Williams' lovely slam into leftfield driving home Derek Jeter home for an early 1-0 lead is sweet. But I'm not writing fast enough, as the dastardly Greg Counsell just tied things with a blast to right. Go Yankees!</p>
<p><i>Update</i>: Well, so much for the early lead, eh?</p>
