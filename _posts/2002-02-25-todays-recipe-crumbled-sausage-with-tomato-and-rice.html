<p>This dish works well with leftover white rice but if you have none make some. Ground beef or ground pork could be used in place of the sausage but remember that sausage is preseasoned if you do.</p>
<p><em>Ingredients:</em>
<ul>
<li>1 1/2 pounds beef sausage, remove meat from skins and chop into bits<br />
</li>
<li>1 lb diced tomatoes with liquid<br />
</li>
<li>6 oz tree ear mushrooms, rough chopped<br />
</li>
<li>6 oz button mushrooms, rough chopped<br />
</li>
<li>3 shallots, sliced thin (would have used some onion but my dinner guest doesn't eat them)<br />
</li>
<li>5 cloves garlic, chopped finely<br />
</li>
<li>1 tbsp plum sauce<br />
</li>
<li>1 bunch fresh basil, chopped finely<br />
</li>
<li>2 tbsp oregano (feel free to substitute fresh)<br />
</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Instructions</em>
<ul>
<li>Heat extra virgin olive oil in skillet, medium heat<br />
</li>
<li>Stir in garlic<br />
</li>
<li>Add shallots, stir well, let oil infuse flavors for 1 minute<br />
</li>
<li>Add tomatoes, stir well<br />
</li>
<li>Add sausage, stir well so that meat is covered thoroughly by other ingredients<br />
</li>
<li>Stir in half of the basil and all the oregano plus salt and pepper<br />
</li>
<li>Simmer for 5 minutes<br />
</li>
<li>Add plum sauce and stir in mushrooms, a little more salt and pepper<br />
</li>
<li>Simmer for 5 minutes<br />
</li>
<li>Remove from heat, stir in remaining basil</li>
</ul>
