<p>The biggest problem I have with the social reactionaries who insist that marriage must and can only be between one man and one woman is it reeks of <a href="http://www.serendipity.li/jsmill/jsmill.htm">tyranny of the majority</a>. Sure we live in a democracy but this is an absurd intrusion of religion and bigotry into personal affairs. Seriously, who the fuck cares about the next person's love life unless he (or she) is so afraid of what might be inside their own heart (or groin); don't tell me this is a sacred concept because, of course, the Constitution itself makes that a meaningless answer.</p>
<p>And more than that, where exactly is Bush going to get the $1.5 billion he mentioned in the SotU farce that he proposes the government spend on educating us all on how to be better married people. As long as we're heterosexual. Very sad.</p>
