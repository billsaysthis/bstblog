<p>Not Uncle, but Walton: Wal-mart is going to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/25734.html">start selling cheap PCs</a> ($300-600) with Lindows, NOT Windows, pre-installed. I think this is a very cool development, because who but retailing behemoth Wal-mart could stand up to MS? My buddy Evan, though, says: "Talk about buying a pig in a poke! Only people who know what they are doing can afford to risk this kind'a system and I think most of them would rather roll their own. In the end I expect there to be a lot of unhappy dumb Walmart customers."</p>
