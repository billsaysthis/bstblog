<p>Steven, writing in USS Clueless, takes us <a href="http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2002/02/fog0000000332.shtml">inside going to War in Iraq</a> in a multi-part series. Powerful and insightful, this is not an essay about whether or not America ought to get into this fight nor is it about the politics; rather a consideration of the technical aspects of how our military might go about it. In case anyone was wondering, this will not be another Afghanistan: "Each of the Republican Guard divisions has more armor and artillery than existed in all of Afghanistan prior to our involvement there." Steven does point out the quite important fact that such a war will not really be won or lost on the battlefield. There's just no way Iraq could win the fighting but might be able to do enough (including the use of devastating chemical weapons) to win by making Americans sick enough (at the sight of large numbers of body bags) to pull out before Saddam is wrecked.</p>
<p>p.s. USS Clueless has a high quality discussion forum, so don't miss these related threads: <a href="http://denbeste.nu/ubb-cgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=000634">Iraq</a> and <a href="http://denbeste.nu/ubb-cgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=000638">Iraq countering U.S. air power</a>.</p>
