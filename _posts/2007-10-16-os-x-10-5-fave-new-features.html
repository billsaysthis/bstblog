<p>Apple announced today that Leopard AKA OS X 10.5 will be released next Friday (what is it with this 'release at 6 p.m. Friday' shtick anyway?) and <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/300.html">published the list of 300+ new features</a>. The ones that most interest me:
<ul>
<li>Time Machine: This is a complete backup and restore application (wonder if it will be better for me than iBackup) with an allegedly simple as pie user interface.</li>
<li>TextEdit: Read and write Word 2007 and OpenDocument formats, makes me wonder if it will replace the majority of my use for NeoOffice. Since I don't have iWork, I'll still be using Neo for spreadsheets and presentations. Unless I can get by with Google's online tools...</li>
<li>Terminal: Tabbed windows, and movable at that. Save the configuration of all open windows as a workspace. Sorry iTerm.</li>
<li>Mail: Improved search (w00t!). Detects text fragments like appointments and addresses, and lets you choose smart actions with a click: create a new contact, map an address, or create an iCal event.</li>
<li>Spotlight: Web history searches, hopefully works with Firefox. Now where was that hot naked chick I was ogling yesterday?</li>
<li>Preview: Edit images in Preview. Crop, rotate, resize, and save images in a range of image formats. Selection tools make it a snap to cut and paste images from Preview directly into other applications.</li>
<li>Automator: I keep thinking I should use this scripting app and maybe now that it will be "easier than ever" I actually will.</li>
</ul>
