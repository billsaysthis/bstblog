<p>My online buddy <a href="http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/">Rogers</a> linked this morning's eBay fraud story over on his very cool <a href="http://www.drudgeretort.com/" title="Sorry, no permalinks but it's on the page of this writing">Drudge Retort site</a> and caused the biggest burst of traffic this site has every seen. (Of course it would have been nice if a few of those visitors clicked the Google ads but whatever.)</p>
