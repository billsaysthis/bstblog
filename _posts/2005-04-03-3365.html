<p>I'm usually four square with the <em>NY Times</em> editorial board but my question about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/03/opinion/03sun2.html?ex=1270180800&amp;en=cd74437c1d401e2e&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt">Moralists at the Pharmacy</a> is: Why are doctors allowed to exercise conscious on this matter and not pharmacists? More broadly, the issue is whether anyone (not employed in an explicitly religious organization) should be allowed to bring their moral judgment to bear on work. This sure does open up a huge can of worms for which I don't have a useful answer.</p>
