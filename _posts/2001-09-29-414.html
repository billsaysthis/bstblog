<p><b>$20 Trillion in revenue available, sign up here</b></p>
<p>Michael Malone, a veteran tech pundit writing in Forbes ASAP, says that the next Internet can <a href="http://www.forbes.com/asap/2001/0910/044_print.html">reboot America</a> and bring in as much as $20 trillion in revenues to the companies lucky and smart enough to survive through the current consolidation/collapse. This revenue will cost $2 trillion to bring in, much of which would have to be spent by government on rebuilding and extending the nation's 30-50 year old physical infrastructure, but will succeed based on the intersection of five trends: optical fiber, semiconductors, the Internet, online transactions, languages and interfaces (XML, SOAP, et al), and Real time enterprise computing. On the other hand, Excite@Home <a href="http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=ATHM&amp;script=410&amp;layout=9&amp;item_id=210411">declared bankruptcy</a> late yesterday.</p>
