<p><b>My community</b></p>
<p>Last night I went to a neighborhood meeting sponsored by the Mountain View City Council Neighborhoods Committee. I'm not sure why I went; after all I've lived here for four and a half years and this was my first time attending any city function. At the meeting, City Manager Kevin Duggan mentioned that a huge historical American flag was hanging in the rotunda of City Hall and today I took my digital camera over to see it. I took some nice photos and put them up here: <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/content/galleries/mv092101_pics.phtml">In and around Mountain View City Hall, Sep. 21, 2001</a>. Since this is the third set of photos, I added a new section to the site navigation as well entitled Photo Galleries.</p>
<p>Mountain View has a lot of public art spread over much of the town, some of it quite good. You can see a <a href="http://www.ci.mtnview.ca.us/visiting/pa/public_art_gallery1.htm">gallery of the works</a>, with location noted for in person viewing, on the <a href="http://www.ci.mtnview.ca.us/">town website</a>.</p>
