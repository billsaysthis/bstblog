<p><a href="http://news.com.com/2008-1082_3-5065859.html?tag=fd_lede2_hed">Very interesting interview</a> looking at going the open source route from a business, not technical, perspective. Seems that when the BSA, the bad guys who went around auditing companies' PCs (think earlier iteration of the jokers at the RIAA if you don't remember), targeted Sterling Ball's company, they made a poor choice. Ball made the smart decision not to fight them but when they left he tossed out his Microsoft software and installed Linux and other open source apps instead; it's been three and a half years and that choice has worked just fine.</p>
<p>This week's <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,1226690,00.asp">Spencer Katt column</a> adds a little OSS mirth by relating a rumor that several companies which use Linux are banding together to file a racketeering lawsuit against the idiots at SCO. I say go get'em!</p>
