<p><b>Rainy, nasty day or opportunity for romance?</b></p>
<p>It's been a nasty, ugly rainy day here in Mountain View today and although there was some let up mid-morning this could cause serious flooding problems being that it's so early in the season I doubt many folks are adequately prepared. According to <a href="http://us.weathernews.com/">Weathernews</a> (via Yahoo!), rain should end late tonight, then a couple of days holding at partly cloudy before good prospect of rain again through the weekend. On the other hand if you and your <a href="http://www.lovefacts.com/love/love030101.shtml'">significant other</a> are home from work then it's a great time to cuddle up and make some of those rainy day fantasies come true!</p>
