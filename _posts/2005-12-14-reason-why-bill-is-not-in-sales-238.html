<p>A co-worker of mine was chatting yesterday with me and our boss and said she'd spoken with  over the weekend. This is a name anyone would recognize, he lives in the mid-peninsula area and has been making great rock since the mid-'60s, but I don't think it's necessary to name names. But I'm telling this here because it's a perfect explanation for why I'm not now and have never been a salesperson.</p>
<p>So my co-worker and her husband are hanging out with a fairly well-known inventor and good friend of theirs. As they talk the inventor mentions he just did some work with , who also happens to be a bit of a geek. She jumps on this and says let's call , she's sure he would be interested in RawSugar. I'm not saying I disagree, but the thought of doing this would just never occur to me.</p>
<p>So the inventor says okay and forks over 's cell phone digits. Lo and behold, the man himself answers and is well-mannered enough that he doesn't even hang up on my co-worker. She quickly explains our service and suggests that he ought to build a directory around the geek hobby that the inventor had worked with him on which, to be clear, is nothing to do with music.  says "Are you kidding?"</p>
<p>My co-worker, though, is a very good salesperson and so doesn't give up after just one try. She gives him some more of the schpiel. Finally,  says he'll check out the site. I see all the new user registrations, so you can be certain I have my eyes wide open in case he does log on.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Aside:</span> Not quite the same cache as  but not bad either, we did have James 'Father of Java' Gosling create an account and try out RawSugar today. He even sent a trouble ticket in and politely sent back the additional information I asked to get for debugging.</p>
