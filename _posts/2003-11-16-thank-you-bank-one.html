<p>The nice people at the bank which holds the paper on my 4Runner's loan sent me a letter saying that to celebrate the coming holidays I can skip my December payment. $279 isn't a huge amount of money but in my situation it surely is helpful. The letter stated that I would be liable for additional interest at the end of my loan, so to be sure I wasn't getting into something more expensive than it would be worth I called and asked. But according to the rep, the only effect is to move the December 2003 payment to somewhere in early 2008. Seems to me like a four year and a few months interest-free loan and I'll be taking it. This is not the first time I've gotten a good break and good service from Bank One, I need to keep that in mind next time I need a loan or something similar.</p>
