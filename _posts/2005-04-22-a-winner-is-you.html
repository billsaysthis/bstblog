<p><a href="http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/entry/2005/04/21#2555">Rogers Cadenhead</a>, one of my <a href="http://www.sportsfilter.com/lockerroom/comments.cfm/722">SportsFilter buddies</a> was smart enough to register a few of the likely pope name domains before the recent election and his bet paid off, he owns <a href="http://benedictxvi.com">benedictxvi.com</a>, and the media coverage the last two days is immense, the link is to the clip of him being interviewed on this morning's <em>Today Show</em>. I was amazed at how together he was, and funny! Before you get twisted on how this nice guy is going to exploit religion, he's already announced the domain is the Vatican's for the asking and in the meanwhile he's donating this week's ad revenues from all his sites to <a href="http://www.modestneeds.org/">Modest Needs</a>. A real mensch, my grandmother would have said.</p>
