<p>Disney is being too cute for its own good. I just saw the TV ad for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316396/">Peter Pan</a>, opening Christmas Day here, and it looked interesting so I put the <a href="http://www.peterpanmovie.com">proffered URL</a> in the browser. I wanted to know who's playing the creepy <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005042/">Captain Hook</a> but instead of getting the expected movie website I was automatically pushed to the generic Disney Pictures site. Which does list a few upcoming releases but not <em>Pan</em>.</p>
