<p>Discover the beauty of snow in the Winter time<br />
<br />Look out the window even though the shades are drawn<br />
<br />100 flakes falling on the tip of your tongue<br />
<br />100 flakes covering your eyes from the light.</p>
<p>And watch a beautiful woman ride down the path<br />
<br />Running behind that tree where you carved a heart<br />
<br />Proclaiming to the world at large just how large<br />
<br />The love within your heart once was.</p>
<p>She was the perfect woman, her parents were rich<br />
<br />But time passes by, complain to no avail,<br />
<br />They turn into this and you get a couple of these<br />
<br />Your arms cannot grow wide enough.</p>
<p>No, you cannot pay enough to keep that irresistible<br />
<br />Urge ablaze, cry though you might and curse though you will<br />
<br />Her hair will gray, and your waist will sag,<br />
<br />Nobody can have magic to change these ways.</p>
<p>Fear not that your love will dim under the weight<br />
<br />Of all the winter flakes that fall for all the Winters<br />
<br />No, the screaming passion will re-emerge in time<br />
<br />With a glow that lasts for as many years as you.</p>
