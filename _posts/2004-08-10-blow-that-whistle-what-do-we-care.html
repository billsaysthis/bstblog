<p>Unfreaking believable! I thought the government had learned something from the last three years of scandals, but apparently the IRS is in a little 'special place' all its own. I mean, you'd think someone who worked there for 22 years would be taken seriously when she complained that the agency was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/10/business/10tax.html?ex=1249790400&amp;en=828d6a9c7a68ea1f&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">violating its own rules</a> in allowing <a href="http://www.micrel.com">a small San Jose company</a> to avoid over $50 million in taxes legitimately owed, most likely because the company used a former high-ranking IRS executive to massage the deal. Brilliant, as the old guys in the Guinness commercial like to say.<br /></p>
