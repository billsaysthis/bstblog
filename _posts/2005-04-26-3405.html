<p>The Smoking Gun have come up with more titilating items in the past but I am amused by the excerpts of <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/brucerider1.html">Springsteen 2002 concert rider</a> the guys posted that came to my attention today. Nothing that extraordinary compared to other acts' demands but just seeing the level of detail is pretty impressive and the language, which is about as lawerly as you'd imagine.</p>
