<p><b>The thanks of a grateful nation</b></p>
<p>In the first hours and days after September 11 I found myself crying when I thought about the people killed in the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and the four planes. The tears would come especially easy when I saw the people on TV who were searching Manhattan for their missing loved ones. I am so thankful that no one I know or love was killed that day. And I'm thankful for the police officers, firefighters, emergency response workers, and others who gave or risked their lives when responding. That was only 10 weeks ago but it seems like another lifetime as we've gone through the buildup to war, the anthrax, the war itself, and the changes (including some that seem ill-advised) since then.</p>
<p>But we're still here. And beyond the families that the terrorists destroyed and dismembered, there are still people who need our help. Please reach out to <a href="http://www.networkforgood.org/">Network for Good</a> and see how you can help. Show the people around you who are hurting, hungry, homeless, cold, or sick that you care enough to share your good fortune with them. Go Nike on the bad things, Just Do it!</p>
