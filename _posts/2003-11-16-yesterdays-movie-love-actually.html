<p>Richard Curtis gives us one of the sweetest movies of recent memory with his meditation on the many aspects of love in <a href="http://www.loveactually.com/">Love Actually</a>. This is <em>not</em> a slick, made for Hollywood movie and if you were expecting a love story with Hugh Grant's Prime Minister falling for Martine McCutcheon's <a href="http://us.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0314331/Ss/0314331/5573_01485_1487R_rgb.jpg?path=pgallery&amp;path_key=McCutcheon,%20Martine">Natalie</a>, as some of the advertising might lead one to believe, you would be wrong though hopefully not disappointed.</p>
<p>Curtis, who made his directorial debut with this effort, is a <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0193485/">veteran screenwriter</a> who has long effective in combining romance and comedy (<em>Bridget Jones's Diary</em>, <em>Notting Hill</em>, <em>Four Weddings and a Funeral</em> for romantic comedies, most of Rowan Atkinson's oevre for pure comedy) and I think he's really put it all together for <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0314331/fullcredits">Love Actually</a>. The film is a melange of vignettes on different types of love, elegantly stitched together, and elevated to a lofty whole by an excellent cast. Grant is <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0111201/">definitely</a> a <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_06_02_blog_archive.phtml#85150088">personal</a> <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_02_09_blog_archive.phtml#90321114">favorite</a>, as is Emma Thompson playing his (younger?) sister--her <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0107616/">Much Ado About Nothing</a> is in my all-time Top 10--married to philandering Alan Rickman.</p>
<p>Love can be wonderful, sweet, endearing, unanticipated but also hard, painful, demanding, disappointing and unrequited, and Curtis covers them all. This is on my Top 5 for the year and I don't expect that to change.</p>
<p><em>Definitely recommended</em></p>
