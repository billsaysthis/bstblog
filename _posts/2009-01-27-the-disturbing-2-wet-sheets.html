<p>She lay on the bed, wet and sticking, taking a deep breathe<br />She reached over and grabbed a robe lying beside the bed<br />Covered herself. Her, well, co-star was already sitting up<br />Faced away from her and chatting up a guy who finished<br />His own scene in the next setup.</p>
<p>The cameramen, sound guys, stagehands, directors were<br />Standing in various groups arranged by concerns:<br />Players, sets, the technical requirements for the next<br />Set of scenes to be shot. No one was really looking at her,<br />No one was talking to her. An anonymous body,<br />She may really as well have been a stick of furniture.</p>
<p>A very pretty and well-stacked bit of blond furniture<br />That suited the technical requirements called for in<br />The day's scripts and directors were well satisfied<br />She could perform on camera as requested, her<br />Skin worked well with the lighting and props, her<br />Hair lovely but easily managed to not interfere.</p>
<p>She wondered whether any of her co-workers<br />Noticed that she often forgot to avoid direct<br />Bodily fluid exchanges and how happy she was to<br />Service anyone on the set. Some actresses were<br />Like that, happy to use a sexy body for career<br />Advancement or reasons stumbling around<br />Inside a woman's mind. None of them, of course,<br />Knew the results of her last doctor visit.</p>
