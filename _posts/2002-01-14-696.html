<p><strong>Football coaching merrygoround: Spurrier to Redskins</strong></p>
<p>Wow! Being Daniel Snyder must be great. To be able to write off a coach like Marty Schottenheimer and the $7.5 million he will get on a contract payoff after being fired and then turn around and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2002/0114/1311209.html">pay Spurrier $5 million</a> a year for five years. At least with Schottenheimer, the Redskins owner got a coach and general manager; part of Spurrier's attraction is that he is <em>not</em> interested in controlling that aspect of the club. Is he worthy of being the NFL's highest paid coach? <a href="http://espn.go.com/abcsports/columns/arute_jack/2002/0114/1311205.html">Opinion</a>, in the first few hours, <a href="http://espn.go.com/chrismortensen/s/2002/0113/1310972.html">is mixed</a>. Hey, does Snyder need an <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/about/blazar_res_05_01.phtml">official weblogger</a>?</p>
