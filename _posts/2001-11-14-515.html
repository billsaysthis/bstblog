<p><b>Tonight's movie: Heist</b></p>
<p>This must be the year for aging stars to make not quite good enough crime flicks. In August we got DeNiro and <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_07_15_blog_archive.phtml#4556421">The Score</a>, with Marlon Brando impersonating a beached whale. Now, in a better movie with really strange dialog, is Gene Hackman in <a href="http://heist.warnerbros.com/cmp/main.html">Heist</a>. Writer-director David Mamet makes an interesting but not $9 a ticket interesting no honor among thieves movie that has Danny Devito somehow in a position to take down Hackman and Delroy Lindo, as if that's believable. Mamet previously gave us gems like Glengarry Glen Ross, Wag the Dog, and The Postman Always Rings Twice but his last few films have been such stinkers as State and Main (although Alec Baldwin was totally believable as a jackass in that) and The Edge (Baldwin again).</p>
