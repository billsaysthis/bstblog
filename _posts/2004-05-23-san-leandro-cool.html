<p>We had a fun afternoon with the chatters at someone's house in San Leandro, where it was quite cool and bereft of real sunshine. Probably 20, 25 people turned out and that's pretty good when you consider that we've been friends for about three years now. Of course it's not all the same people, some have drifted out or moved away and others have joined, but I am surprised all the same.</p>
<p>Good to see some of the other couples too, like--using their chat nicknames--<a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=prettys_0302&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=prettys_satori_forbidden.jpg">ForbiddenIllusion</a> and <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=backbeat_01_02&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=luvbugg.jpg" title="She's kill me for still having this old picture online">LoveBugg</a> (getting married later this year) and Spazz and AlanaMae (together for a year now, she was our host). I tried AlanaMae's lumpia, yummy, and we had a couple of grills going with various meats. We were celebrating some birthdays too, the aforementioned LoveBugg and <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=backbeat_01_02&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=spacehunny_ellie.jpg" title="Show here with my sweetie">Ellie</a> too. <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=backbeat_01_02&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=sociable_pretty.jpg" title="She's drinking soda these days">PrettySmilez</a> showed off her totally cute three week old son.</p>
<p>There ought to be a couple of pictures of Vivian and/or me and I'll post them when they arrive.</p>
