<p><strong>Toys for well-to-do suburbanites</strong></p>
<p>Scot Peterson, in EWeek (I still have to remember it's no longer PCWeek), <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article/0,3658,s%253D1866%2526a%253D18694,00.asp">writes</a> about the problems Microsoft is having demonstrating the value of .Net My Services. You mean, besides the clunky name? Good thing, Peterson says, "even Microsoft President Rick Belluzzo appeared as nauseated as I was." I suppose the MS marketing crew is trying to preserve the purity of the .Net brand by forcing it to be the first word in any product name but would My .Net Services roll off the tongue a whole lot easier?</p>
