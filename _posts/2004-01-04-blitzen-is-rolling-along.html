<p>I haven't posted much since <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_12_21_blog_archive.phtml#107240487958132084">the original mention</a> but a good deal of progress has been made with the framework project though I still am nowhere near ready to post code. Rest assured that much time and thought has gone into it; the PHP is streamlined and tested, the CSS is primitive yet correct, new pages are simple to add, and page content is easily authored and maintained (a major goal, trust me). While programmers who've created more substantial systems might look at Blitzen as trivial (and they're probably not wrong), I'm laser-focused on my client's requirements and also quite happy with the state of things.</p>
