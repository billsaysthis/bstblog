<p>"Common Good has begun what it plans to make an annual event by announcing the <a href="http://cgood.org/news-all/item?item_id=43579">top five ridiculous lawsuits of 2003</a>." I cannot argue with the incredibly poor judgment shown by the courts in each suit nor with CG's objective. [<em>via <a href="http://coolstop.com/radio/archives/000890.shtml">jennett.radio</a></em>]</p>
<p>Speaking of strange legal developments, Norma McCorvey (the Roe of Roe V. Wade) <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1076428360477">has filed suit</a> to overturn the historic 1973 Supreme Court decision making abortion legal in this country. The federal trial court judge sensibly dismissed the case as not meeting the timeliness requirements for such pleadings but the apellate court is apparently not so sure and will hear an appeal in a couple of weeks. Making the situation really odd is that the Dallas District Attorney (the successor to the 'Wade' of the original case) has decided that, because the law on which the originating case was based is no longer on the books, he has no need or duty to respond and therefore has filed no papers with the Court of Appeals. McCorvey, by the way, no longer believes abortion is a good idea.</p>
