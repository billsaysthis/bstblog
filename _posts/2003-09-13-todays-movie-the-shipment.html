<p>Somehow I'm not surprised that there is no scriptwriter credit (which <a href="http://filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/VideoHome/5CA03B773056BA2888256C600000F02D/?OpenDocument">would actually belong</a> to Richard Steen) in the IMDB database; makes me wonder what name's the writer equivalent of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0000647/">Alan Smithee</a> and why it wasn't used for this piece of dreck. <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0268636/">The Shipment</a> does nothing for the careers of Mathew Modine or Elizabeth Berkeley, though clearly they hoped to show off the ability to carry a romantic caper comedy. Some moments of amusement but not nearly enough to justify the investment of 100 minutes of lifespan.</p>
<p><em>Not recommended</em></p>
