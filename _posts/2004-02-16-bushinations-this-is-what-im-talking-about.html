<p>I have at times found myself in conversations with people who don't understand the core behaviours which I find so objectionable about our current ruling elite. An article in today's Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/16/politics/16DELA.html?ex=1392267600&amp;en=4cde0e93f813cbb3&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">Inquiry Focuses on Group DeLay Created</a>, is an excellent example so I'm blogging it for future reference. Or to end any question this group may have as to just where my sentiments lie for future investigations.</p>
