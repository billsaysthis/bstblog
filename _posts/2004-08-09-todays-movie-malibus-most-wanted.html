<p>I can honestly say I never expected to watch Jamie Kennedy's <a href="http://www.malibusmostwanted.com/">Malibu's Most Wanted</a>, the story of a rich white boy ignored by his parents (Ryan O'Neal and the barely onscreen Bo Derek) who turns to ghetto culture for fulfillment instead. Embarassed and scared his son will screw up his campaign for governor, Dad and an advisor (Blair Underwood, showing that actors understand where the cheddar comes from) cook up a fake kidnapping to "scare the black out" of Kennedy.</p>
<p>Although JK is far too old to be the high schooler his character is, the movie pretty much works. Anthony Anderson and Taye Diggs as the least black black men you ever saw really contribute and Regina Hall is smart and sexy enough for any man.</p>
<p><em>surpringly funny</em><br /></p>
