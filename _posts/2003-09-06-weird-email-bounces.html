<p>Are you seeing a bunch of Undeliverable Mail notices from sme Mailer Daemon in your inbox lately? I am and the strange thing is that the supposed sending address is some odd combination of alphanumerics (for instance, 4rertttrrr) at my domain. Combinations that I don't use, for mail sent to addresses that I've never heard of. Makes about as much sense as the idiotic Visa commercial running now that stars Derek Jeter and George Steinbrenner. As if a guy making around $18 million a year from his Yankees salary alone needs to justify spending a few dollars on going out to high priced restaurants. Anyway, the emails, well I'd think virus or worm but I've got the latest Norton A-V running at all times, including the weekly system scan and all the available patches from MS. Volume isn't high enough to think that a spammer is forging mail headers and using my domain. So just very strange.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Of course, as soon as I pushed the Publish button on this entry a virus-infected email arrived. Caught by NAV but still...</p>
