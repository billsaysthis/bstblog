<p><a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2006_08_13_blog_archive.phtml#115561535596768661">As I mentioned</a> the Blogger beta transition is not a smooth course. In fact, I sent a help request in but other than the automated response have had no contact. The login issue remains a problem. Errrr!</p>
<p>The automated response--which seems to be standard policy from Google these days across consumer products--is to send a message which includes pointers to a few FAQ entries, not at all targeted at the subject of the help requests and ends with the somewhat irritating sentence:</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">If your question or problem is not addressed anywhere in our documentation, please simply reply to this message and let us know.</span></p>
<p>I suppose a good number of users write in without attempting to find any answer in the support material first. Some of us, however, do but the automated nature of the system means we need to take twice the action. That's not how I ran things at NetDynamics.</p>
