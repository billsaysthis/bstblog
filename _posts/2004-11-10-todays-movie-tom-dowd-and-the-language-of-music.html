<p>The art of recording music has been born and revolutionized time after time in just the last century and a bit. One man, with a beautiful heart and a soul that was simply musical, is little known to the lovers of modern music but made undisputable contributions to several of those revolutions and helped give us an <a href="http://www.thelanguageofmusic.com/discography.htm">amazing amount of many different types of hugely popular music</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thelanguageofmusic.com/">Tom Dowd and the Language of Music</a> is a loving biography of that man, made in the months before Dowd passed away, during a time when he was still making new music with modern talent in his mid-70s. He began as a recording engineer when Atlantic Records was founded in the late '40s, built the first real commercial stereo and multi-track studios and took to the computerized studios of the '90s and later like he was born to it.</p>
<p>Who did Dowd record? Jazz and R&amp;B artists like John Coltrane, Charles Mingus, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, and Otis Redding. And rockers, man did he work the board magic for rockers: Eric Clapton (both The Cream and <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:23jqeaz04xs7%7ET1">Derek and the Dominos</a>), The Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Young Rascals, The Drifters, Bobby Darin, Dusty Springfield, Rod Stewart and Cher. So many more, just an awesome discography.</p>
<p>There isn't too much detail about the technical aspects of what Dowd did, though he does go back to the original <em>Layla</em> tapes and give a little taste of how the individual tracks fit together in the mix. Some discussion of his pioneering work in stereo and multi-track recording. Lots of interviews with artists he worked with--Clapton talks about believing so much more in Dowd's musical instincts than his own and Gregg Allman cannot say enough about Dowd as a man. Plus his important partners at Atlantic Records, his boss and company founder Ahmet Ertegun, producer Jerry Wexler and protege Phil Ramone.</p>
<p>A sweet taste of the last half century of music. A portrait of a man who was a key piece of connective tissue across musical eras and genres.</p>
