<p>Yeah, Hussein has to go. The inspectors had their time and Iraq had the specified chance to comply with 1441. Time's up.</p>
<p>But the domestic portions of the speech were just sad. As if dividends were the only place government took our money twice. Just a gimme to his patrons. Two sentence mention of his plans to give other patrons whatever they want on the environment. And so much for last year's promise that any deficits from his tax cut plans would be small and short lived; now we're looking at $300 million or more per year for over a decade.</p>
<p>And what's with all the interruptions for applause every other 30 seconds? Isn't the speech long enough as it is?</p>
<p>Feh!</p>
