<p>I'm watching <a href="http://www.cheaptrick.com/">Cheap Trick</a> (and <a href="http://www.fountainsofwayne.com/home/" title="I actually tuned in to check these guys out">Fountains of Wayne</a>) on a <a href="http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/concerts/69880/episode_about.jhtml">VH1 concert show</a> just now. While seeing some younger people--teenagers--in the audience bopping to the tunes, I realized that I actually saw Cheap Trick in concert before these kids were born. 25 fucking years ago! That was a great concert, a double bill in Providence, RI, with Richie Blackmore's Rainbow (Dio was a great heavy metal singer, no doubt, and Blackmore just rocks), but it was 25 YEARS AGO DAMMIT! Seriously, this is making me feel old and the lower back pain is not helping. And yes, Rick Nielson did bring out one of those four or five necked monstrous guitars to play <a href="http://www.cheaptrick.com/ag_sample4.ram" title="Short Realaudio sample">Surrender</a>.</p>
