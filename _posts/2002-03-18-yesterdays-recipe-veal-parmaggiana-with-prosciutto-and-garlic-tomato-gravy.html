<p>A little dinner party with Vivian and another couple, so a trip was made to the local German butcher and a fresh produce market. The following was served with a simple green salad and spaghetti and followed by a delicious baked New York Cheesecake topped with fresh strawberries placed atop a mix of chocolate and strawberry syrup. You will need a large skillet, a medium to large stock pot, and a large baking dish for the recipe:</p>

<ul>
<li>4 veal cutlets, pounded thin<br />

</li>
<li>2 tbsp of cilantro<br />
</li>
