<p>Back in the mid-90s, a lot of writers and directors in Hollywood wanted to make the next <a href="http://video.go.com/pulpfiction-jackiebrown/main.html">Pulp Fiction</a>. And every studio wanted to release it, which probably explains how a guy like Klaus Hoch, who'd been hanging around Hollywood looking for a break, was able to get the green light to make <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0132165">Flypaper</a>.</p>
<p>This is a very strange movie which just can't bring off the combination of hardcore and comedy the way Tarantino did. Hell, even Tarantino had trouble with the formula in his followup. Hoch sets in motion a bunch of characters who slowly are drawn into each others' orbits. Mostly, since he leaves a few loose ends hanging. There's a sense of absurdity that kept me watching (well, that and the sexual nudity of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/EGallery?source=ss&amp;group=0305357&amp;photo=Ss/0305357/ct-409_sm.jpg&amp;path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Liu,%20Lucy">Lucy Liu</a> and Sadie Frost).</p>
<p><em>Mildly recommended</em></p>
