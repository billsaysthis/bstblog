<p><b>Talking Moose weds Britney Spears!</b></p>
<p>I'm not usually such a gossip, but <a href="http://talkingmoose.manilasites.com/2001/09/29">this</a> is too good to pass up! Moose, however did you win the little hottie away from Justin Timberlake? She must be looking to the mud bog as an oasis from the pressures of stardom; didn't know she was into the au natural lifestyle, though. Cool, man, cool.</p>
<p>Seriously, this Mooselog is really titled "The weblog manifesto" and discusses the state of the art in weblogs and is the usual cool Moosepoop. But he does make the above wedding reference!</p>
