<p>Them French intellectuals have gone and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3329321.stm">done it again</a>. While the new law may fight against certain visible symbols of religion-oriented politics, what about all the other symbols that will be outlawed as well? I can only imagine the reaction of a yarmulke-wearing Jew or cross-wearing Christian when they're told to take them off or else don't bother attending school or coming to a government office. Yeah, that'll work real well.</p>
