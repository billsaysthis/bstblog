<p>So the Reds send out Anthony le Tallec and Neil Mellor on loan to Sutherland and Wigan and both score goals today (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4612222.stm">West Brom 0-1 Sunderland</a>, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4612202.stm">Middlesbro 2-3 Wigan</a>). I can understand sending away a player surplus to requirements (as they say in the Premiership) to bottomdwelling Sutherland but a player I don't see as surplus at all to the team just a few places beneath you in the standings? That doesn't make as much sense to me. Oh well, I'm still looking forward to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4612230.stm">tomorrow's clash at Old Trafford</a>.</p>
<p>Although <a href="http://football.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,,1691681,00.html">How Ben√≠tez built Liverpool</a> by Kevin McKarra is a good explanation as to why these deals were done and that someone like me should not be second guessing Rafa.</p>
