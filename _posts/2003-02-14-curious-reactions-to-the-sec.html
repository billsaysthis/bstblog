<p>Does it seem strange to anyone else that while the last chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Harvey Pitt, was widely derided as an appropriate choice because he'd spent his career as a lawyer for investment banks while the new (confirmed last night) chairman, William Donaldson, caused no such reactions even though he's spent his career running investment firms? He is the Donaldson in Donaldson, Lufkin, Jenrette, has been the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, and run one of the largest insurance firms.</p>
