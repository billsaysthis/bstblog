<p>Ev has been <strike>promising</strike><strike>promoting</strike>informing us that a new. improved publishing engine for Blogger is coming. And us fanatics are waiting patiently (well sort of), especially for an update to the API that would include the title and a more robust server codebase. Perhaps the time of this engine is drawing near, but it isn't here yet as evidenced by this screenshot from today's (April 5) Evhead:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/evhead_032902.jpg" alt="View of Evhead on April 5, 2002" border="1" /></p>
<p>What's wrong? Well, the date is not March 29. Also, the engine is supposed to process the weblog template and replace the Blogger variable $BlogItemSubject$ with the post's actual title. Further, and this is not possible to see from the screenshot, the permalink (represented by the time stamp at the end of the entry) is not generated correctly either.</p>
<p>Ev, we are waiting with baited breath. You know that we tease because we love; a friendly, communal kind of love, don't get the wrong idea, you funny guy.</p>
<p><em>Update five minutes later:</em> Well Ev is fast, I'll give him that! He either fixed the three bugs I listed really quickly or else went back to publishing via the old engine. Either way I was correct in grabbing a screenshot for this entry!</p>
