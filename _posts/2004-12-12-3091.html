<p>Congratulations, <a href="http://www.mattleinartblog.com/" title="link is to his blog">Matt Leinart</a> on winning the 6th Heisman Trophy awarded to a USC football star. One more big thing to do this season: Lead the Trojans past Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl the same way you beat their QB and RB today at the Downtown Athletic Club. Suh-weet!</p>
