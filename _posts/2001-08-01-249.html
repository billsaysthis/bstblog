<p><b>Everything goes better with Water</b><br />

<p>I've eaten at a few <a href="http://www.olivegarden.com/">Olive Garden</a> restaurants and been generally satisfied, although the service can leave you a little <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=nonplussed">nonplussed</a>. But, like all businesses, the managers there attempt to maximize revenues and profits. When people order soft drinks instead of tap water, the tab is higher, so the good folks at Coca Cola stepped in to <a href="http://customer.coca-cola.com/html/olivegard_article_ss.html">help Olive Garden sell more soda</a>. They came up with a plan called H2NO and an incentive contest called "Just Say No to H2O." I suppose the simple fact that <a href="http://my.webmd.com/content/article/1671.52349">water is healthier</a> for us to drink doesn't really matter to them.</p>
