<p>Is not such a bad thing when your father is <a href="http://www.james-taylor.com/">James Taylor</a> and your mother is <a href="http://www.carlyfan.com/">Carly Simon</a>. This is the good fortune of <a href="http://www.ben-taylor.com/">Ben Taylor</a>, whose first album is being released on Tuesday. And Ben is not at all one of those pissy kids upset by comparison to Dad and instead is <a href="http://www.nypost.com/entertainment/54354.htm">quite pleased by the suggestion</a>. I heard his first single on the <a href="http://www.kfog.com">radio</a> yesterday, a song called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/clipserve/B000077W1M001002/1/002-8967961-9183264" title="Link is to RealPlayer clip">Let It Grow</a>, and thought to myself, Gee that sounds a lot like James Taylor, but not quite. Then the DJ came on and named the singer and I said (to myself), Self, you are one smart dude.</p>
