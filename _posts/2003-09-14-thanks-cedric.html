<p>I want to say that wide receiver Cedric Wilson cost the 49ers today's game against St. Louis; all he had to do was go down after making a last-second reception inside the Rams' 30 yard line with three seconds or so left. A timeout would have stopped the clock and let us kick a moderate, but not too difficult, field goal for a 27-24 win. Instead, Wilson ran sideways across the field in a vain attempt at glory, the Rams won the coin toss and drove to the Niners' nine and kicked the winning field goal.</p>
<p>But that would put a little too much blame and emphasis on one play. The 49ers were called for well over a hundred yards in penalties, including a really unnecessary 15 yard face mask violation in OT, that time and again gave St. Louis better field position or put us out of it. And the defense, in particular the secondary, gave up way too much space in the second half after a sterling opening 30.</p>
<p>Hopefully next week against <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=230914033" title="Browns gave up a record 280 yards rushing to Jamaal Lewis today">Cleveland</a> the result will be more favorable.</p>
