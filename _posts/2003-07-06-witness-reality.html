<p>You watch shows like <a href="http://www.hbo.com/sopranos">The Sopranos</a>, <a href="http://www.hbo.com/thewire">The Wire</a>, <a href="http://abc.abcnews.go.com/primetime/nypdblue/index.html">NYPD Blue</a>, and such, and realize that being a witness in a serious trial is not a task one takes on lightly. There's a reason, beyond the certainty of avoiding a fickle jury, why television detectives go to the lengths of getting a confession--<em>NYPD Blue</em> demonstrated this clearly in an episode where the only useful eyewitness was one the squad's little boys--and that's because of the danger to witnesses. In fact, the NY Times has an excellent (though lengthy) article today on the killing of a witness named Bobby Gibson: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/06/nyregion/06WITN.html">Justice, Safety and the System</a>. Certainly raises the question in my mind of what I would do if confronted with the situation.</p>
