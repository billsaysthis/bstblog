<p><b>Self-publishing or working at Microsoft?</b><br />

<p>Adam Barr wrote a book about <a href="http://www.proudlyserving.com/">his tenure at Microsoft</a>, 10 years as a programmer, sounds interested and I may someday get a chance to read it. He's written <a href="http://www.proudlyserving.com/oso.htm">other things</a> too but I got a great laugh out of <a href="http://fourstones.net/DrSelfPub.html">Dr. Selfpub, Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Amazon.Com</a>, his story of his experience writing and selling the book. Lucky dog, Barr sold his MS options when the stock was over $100/share early last year; I only wish I'd done the same with <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=t&amp;s=SUNW">Sun</a>. I read about Adam's book and article in Victor Stone's interesting article <a href="http://fourstones.net/ct20010709.html">Image Problems</a>; Stone also previously worked as a programmer at MS, although not with Barr.</p>
