<p>If you all did not watch the first episode yet, make sure you catch it--it's on twice more between now and the next new episode on Tuesday night. <a href="http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/niptuck/main.html">Wow</a>. It's on F/X if you haven't read about it and this does for plastic surgery what Shield and Sopranos do for cops and robbers. Wow. Just finished watching the pilot and the first thing I'm doing is writing you this heads up. Definitely on the nasty and bloody side of things, so be aware. Stars yet another hunky Australian guy, Julian McMahon as the slick, sexier brother--I though I recognized him all along but couldn't say from where and it turns out he used to play Cole, who was also a demon, on <em>Charmed</em>.</p>
