<p>One of my favorite webpages is the Futon Critic's <a href="http://www.thefutoncritic.com/guide.aspx?id=whendoes">When Does (Insert Show) Come Back?</a> This is the best source I know of for finding out when (or if) a particular series will be airing original episodes again. They try to be complete (<span style="font-style:italic;">Tripping the Rift</span> is still listed, for example) though with a few surprising holes (why are some BBC America mysteries listed and not others). Still, there's no other single page which gives a simple, comprehensive list like this.</p>
<p>Shows I'm looking forward and their airdates include:
<ul>
<li><span style="font-style:italic;">Rome</span>: Jan. 7</li>
<li><span style="font-style:italic;">The L Word</span>: Jan. 7</li>
<li><span style="font-style:italic;">24</span>: Jan. 14/15 (once again, Fox is doing the very neat four hour blockbuster intro)</li>
<li><span style="font-style:italic;">Monk</span>: Jan. 19</li>
<li><span style="font-style:italic;">Stargate SG-1</span>: March 2  (final season)</li>
<li><span style="font-style:italic;">The Sopranos</span>: March 11 (final season)</li>
<li><span style="font-style:italic;">Entourage</span>: March 11</li>
<li><span style="font-style:italic;">South Park</span>: March 21 (Eleventh season, can you believe it?)</li>
<li><span style="font-style:italic;">The Shield</span>: April 3 (final season?)</li>
<li><span style="font-style:italic;">The 4400</span>: June 3</li>
<li><span style="font-style:italic;">Rescue Me</span>: June 17</li>
<li><span style="font-style:italic;">Eureka</span>: July 17</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of new shows caught my eye while I was checking network websites just now:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch.aspx?id=dirt">Dirt</a>, coming Jan. 2 on USA, features Courtney Cox as editor-in-chief of a sleazy celebrity tabloid. Ought to be interesting if Cox (who is also executive producer) can remember this is not just a hatchet job on paparazzi and their employers.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.scifi.com/tinman/">Tin Man</a> (tentative title) won't be on SciFi until December of next year but the press release makes me think this re-imagining of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wizard of Oz</span> will be wild. Written by Steven Long Mitchell and Craig Van Sickle (creators of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Pretender</span>, which I thought was underrated), this six hour miniseries will replace the fantasy of the original with science fiction versions.</li>
</ul>
