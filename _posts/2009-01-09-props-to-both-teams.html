<p>While I wish USC had been in the game, both Oklahoma and Florida played really well tonight and gave the nation a quality national title game. Florida won 24-14 and there can be no question the Gators were the better side, but overall the game was close, clean, no one can complain about the refereeing and the result wasn't settled until late.</p>
<p>Tim Tebow was awesome, just a dump truck in pads, Pervy Harvin was close behind with three huge runs and the Florida defense made more than enough solid stops. Two titles in three seasons for Urban Meyers, with two different quarterbacks, is hard to argue with.</p>
<p>If Tebow and Mark Sanchez both come back for their senior seasons, I'd love to see next year's BCS matchup be Florida versus USC!</p>
