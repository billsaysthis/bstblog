<p>The Niners have just run off for halftime and the play so far is a perfect encapsulation of their season. After a scoreless first quarter Jeff Garcia passed to Jed Weaver for a 7-0 lead on a 68 yard drive, then Jeff Ulbrich intercepted a Matt Hasselback pass which Garcia took advantage of by throwing a TD pass to Cedric Wilson. Right after that, the Niners defense got comfortable thinking that they would have an easy time taking the 14 point lead into the lockerroom. So of course the Seahawks got two fast touchdowns and the score was tied. Garcia said F this and almost got the lead back but Wilson took a bad penalty with only seconds left and we had to settle for a field goal attempt. You know what this means--Todd Peterson banged the ball of the right post for the miss.</p>
<p><a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/boxscore?gid=20031227025&amp;refresh=0">To summarize:</a> decent offense, especially from the QB but not much from the running game, flashes of brilliance from the defense but not able to make it stand up, and a crap kicking game including too many short kickoffs.</p>
<p><em>Later:</em> Continuing the season theme, the 49ers did lose. The offense couldn't quite get it together with Garcia in particular throwing several short passes and the defense wasn't able to stuff a late field goal drive that ate up all the Niners timeouts; throw in a little blame for Erickson who blew a timeout when he challenged Koren Robinson's beautiful touchdown reception. Like quite a few of this season's losses, this one could have been a win with a little better effort across the board.</p>
