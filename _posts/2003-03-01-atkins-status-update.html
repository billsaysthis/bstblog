<p>Today marks six months on the diet for me and the Sweet One. I'm proud to report that we've both been keeping to the straight and narrow and that we believe in the Atkins as a healthy way to manage our food, so we will keep on it for a long time to come. Multivitamins, calcium, glucosamine and condroitin pills. Generally four workouts a week at the gym.</p>
<p>Mornings are pretty standard: two hard boiled eggs or two egg omelette plus an Atkins blueberry muffin, with two or three slices of bacon added on the weekends; occasionally pancakes or french toast instead, with low carb maple syrup. I make a batch of the muffins once a week. Lunch is leftover meat or lunch meat plus a salad. I usually have two Atkins bars a day, Chocolate Mocha Crunch or the new Smores flavors, while Vivian prefers the Endulge Caramel Nut Chews and sesame seeds.</p>
<p>Dinners are usually terrific. Meat runs every five or six weeks to Costco supplemented with the occasional fresh shrimp or piece of veal keep us stocked and we rotate chicken thighs, whole chickens, ground beef, steaks, pork chops, pork or beef ribs, steaks, sole, salmon, and, the newest addition, catfish. Plus visits to In'n'Out (like last night) for a double-double protein style and otherwise rarely eat out.</p>
<p>We pick up fresh veggies for sides at the Mountain View Farmer's Market on Sundays or at the supermarkets weekdays: spinach, bok choy, string beans, brocolli (steamed, sauteed, or even pureed), zuccini, or asparagus, once in a while sauteed mushrooms and onions. As the good doctor (Atkins, that is) says, lots of garlic.</p>
<p>How much weight have we lost? I shouldn't--won't--say about TS1, two things one doesn't ask are a woman's age or weight, but I've lost 39 pounds. Still a long way to go to 170 but I'm encouraged and motivated. Our wedding is only 70 days away!</p>
