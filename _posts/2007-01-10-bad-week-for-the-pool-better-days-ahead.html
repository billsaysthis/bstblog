<ul>
<li>FA Cup: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/6213931.stm">Liverpool 1-3 Arsenal</a>, the title defense ends on the first outing.</li>
<li>Carling Cup: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/league_cup/6236687.stm">Liverpool 1-3 Arsenal</a>, third worst home defeat ever, though I will note that the starting squad only included three of our first choice XI, Hyypia, Gerrard and Bellamy, while Arsenal used four or five of theirs</li>
<li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/6249279.stm">Injuries</a>: Luis Garcia and his magic lost for the season (torn ACL) after coming on in the 11th minute for Mark Gonzalez (often on the field when Luis Garcia is not), out for three weeks, who left with a shin injury.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Silver linings</span>
<ul>
<li>Better rested players for Premiership (next up, at Watford on Saturday and home to Chelsea--NOT on FSC, dammit--a week later) and Champions League matches (Next up, home and away with Barcelona in late February and early March).</li>
<li>Injuries: We ought to get Zenden back at the weekend and <a href="http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N154656070110-1331.htm">Sissoko</a> for the first match in February, a derby with Everton. While StevieG may not like it I expect he will be moved back to the right so Sissoko can play hard man in the center.</li>
<li>Transfers: First deal in the window nets a young Italian keeper called Daniele Padelli <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/6244471.stm">on loan</a> from Serie A Sampdoria, though I'm not clear why since he hasn't pushed his way into the starting lineup while on loan at Serie B club Crotone. Rumors are rampant that serious bids have been made to buy Blackburn/Australia defender Lucas Neill and Hamilton Academical teenage midfielder Jamie Macarthy, the Reds are targeting young Watford star striker Ashley Young and that Argentine star (but so far no big deal at West Ham) midfielder Javier Mascherano has rejected the renewed interest of Juventus to hold out for a move to Anfield. Meanwhile, Aston Villa want to steal Craig Bellamy, who only arrived in the summer, and Newcastle think Peter Crouch can be the solution to their striker woes. Only 20 trading days left!</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's not forget that the team is still third in the Premier League and Manchester United and (especially) Chelsea have faltered just a wee bit in recent weeks, with the Reds just eight points back of the Blues and a crucial three points that can be made up on January 20.</p>
