<p><em>"Berke always told me his goal was to figure out how to take an issue and make it funny. The more serious an issue, the bigger the challenge. And since he just finished a children’s book about animal shelters (“Flawed Dogs”), I think he feels ready for any challenge."</em> From the <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/992830.asp?0dm=C16WL&amp;cp1=1">Opus interview</a> by fellow MeFite <a href="http://www.wendellwit.com/">Wendell Wittler</a>.</p>
