<p><strong>Reporters that leave important info out, today's example</strong> - in <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1033-945023.html">Wi-Fi group clears up naming confusion</a>, Ben Charny explains that WECA is changing it's name to WiFi Alliance (good) and that it's dropping the term WiFi5 as an alternate to 802.11a (like 802.11b is also called WiFi). But he doesn't make clear what name the Alliance will be using in place of WiFi5--just 802.11a or something else. <em>D'oh!</em></p>
