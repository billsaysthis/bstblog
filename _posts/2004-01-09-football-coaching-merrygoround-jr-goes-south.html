<p>Another hiring today: Jim Mora Jr. is leaving after five years as the San Francisco 49ers' defensive coordinator <a href="http://www.ajc.com/falcons/content/sports/falcons/0104/09mora.html">to become the new head coach</a> of the Atlanta Falcons. Mora is the son of the former Colts and Saints head man of the same name (obviously). Rumor has it that he'll take Niner offensive coordinator Greg Knapp with him to mold Michael Vick's injury comeback. Mora certainly did a quality job with the Niner defense and will be missed.</p>
