<p>A couple of years back, many personal sites posted lists of weird searches (on, for instance, Google) that ended up with the searcher clicking through to that site. I found one sufficiently weird in the referrer log today to mention: someone searched Daypop for the <a href="http://www.daypop.com/search?q=I&amp;s=1891&amp;c=10&amp;t=w&amp;ext=true">letter I</a>. That's it, a capital I, the letter after H. Somehow only 8403 pages in the Daypop database matched and I was on the 189th page (since their are 10 results per page), though there's no link on this page to my site just now. Someone clicked through 189 pages of results to get to my site! (Other oddity: Daypop has "35,000 News Sites, Weblogs and RSS feeds" in it's database and only 8400 have the letter I?)</p>
