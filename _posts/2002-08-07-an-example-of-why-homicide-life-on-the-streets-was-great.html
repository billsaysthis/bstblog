<p>Possibly, TV Guide nonsense aside, the greatest TV show ever. Watching it via Tivo's Season Pass daily now. Pre-credits opening scene on this episode: NYPD Det. Mike Logan (Chris Noth) of Law and Order, another great cop show, delivers a prisoner to Det. Frank Pembleton (Andre Braugher) at the Baltimore train station. The prisoner, played by eccentric film director and lifelong Baltimore resident/devotee John Waters, has waived the extradition hearing and faces two charges of first degree murder. The three of them stand around for the scene and explain to each other why their city (well, it's two on one) is better: Dorothy Parker, Edgar Alan Poe for Baltimore, Babe Ruth for NYC. All to set up the prisoner's punchline, in response to Braugher's comment that at least the time will be served in their jail: "I maybe guilty but I'm not stupid."</p>
<p>Just amazing, literary allusions, alliteration, and a terrific punchline.</p>
