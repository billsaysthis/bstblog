<p><strong>Thanksgiving 2001 - I'm thankful, are you?</strong></p>
<p>So tomorrow we'll mostly all sit down with friends, or family, or even by ourselves and enjoy a day, maybe two, off from work. Insert cliche here. Blah blah blah, right? But how often do you actually think about how good life is for you, how fortunate you are not to be living in a refugee camp just inside the border of Pakistan with a hellacious winter about to come on? I know I don't think about this often enough. Okay, I don't have a job right now. But I do have a warm house, food to eat, a nice car to drive, I just got a Tivo, and especially I have friends with whom to share these good times. I am thankful, I hope you are too. Have fun, enjoy the day, enjoy the football, the food, the company, just remember that if you can read this webpage you have it better than most of the people on this planet.</p>
