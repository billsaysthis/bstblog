<p>Over two years ago, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_04_21_blog_archive.phtml#85034127">I mentioned</a>&nbsp;that thanks to being on the winning side of a class action lawsuit against BankAmerica that $16 would be coming my way in around 12 months. Well, it's been quite a bit longer but I made out much better--given money market account interest rates taken into account--when the check arrived in today's mail for the princely sum of $25.32, reducing my net loss on the original investment to only $1237. Go to love those lawyers. <em>Suh-weet!</em><br /></p>
