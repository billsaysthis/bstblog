<p>After the whole executive retirement storm, there are some positive stories coming out this week and with any luck the stock will remain above $7:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-912700.html?tag=fd_top">Sun retakes Unix sales lost to IBM</a> - moving up to 54% market share of UNIX-based servers, all the 3.3% gain at IBM's expense.</li>
<p>
<li><a href="http://www.eweek.com/article/0,3658,s=702&amp;a=26403,00.asp">Blueprints for Sun's New Direction</a> - very positive article on the new Blueprints programs at Sun which give customers and tire kickers detailed instructions on installing and configuring complete solutions featuring Sun products at their core.</li>
<p>
<li><a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-912906.html?tag=fd_top">Microsoft ploy to block Sun exposed</a> - one has to wonder how hard the execs at MS laugh at the rest of us sometimes.</li>
<p>
<li><a href="http://www.eweek.com/article/0,3658,s=720&amp;a=26823,00.asp">Solaris 9 to Ease Patch Uploads</a> - working to match some of the innovative Linux systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Somehow, I wonder if I'm speaking too soon, if Sun will ever get back to say $10 and save my butt.</p>
