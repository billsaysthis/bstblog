<p>This week saw the birthdays of two of our favorite chatters, Michelle (who really does have a pretty smile) and Allen (only he knows why he's Griff), and there was a party last night. Didn't get a picture of Allen but here's one with Michelle. Beforehand, a few of us ate dinner at H's Lordship at the Berkeley Marina and we took a few photos there too and here's one of me and Vivian.</p>
