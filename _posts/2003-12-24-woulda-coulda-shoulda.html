<p>Reminding everyone watching of 1999, Research in Motion gave shareholders a major Xmas present today by sending the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=rimm">share price up over 50%</a> with a "dazzling" earnings outlook. Cool for them! Could somebody mention this to Scott McNealy for me? Thanks.</p>
