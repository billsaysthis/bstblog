<p>On the Atkins diet, one eats copious quantities of meat. So about every four or five weeks we make a meat run to the butcher shop at Costco to stock up. The bill came to just over a C note, including some salad, Ziploc freezer bags, swiss cheese, and whipped cream and we got:
<ul>
<li>4 lbs sliced Turkey Breast (for lunches)<br />
</li>
<li>4 lbs Bacon (actually this is usually weekend breakfast food)<br />
</li>
<li>2.35 lbs Top Sirloin (4 steaks, 2 meals)<br />
</li>
<li>4.15 lbs Pork Loin Chop (10 chops, 3 meals with leftovers)<br />
</li>
<li>6.25 lbs Fryer Thighs (14 thighs, 5 meals with leftovers)<br />
</li>
<li>5.52 lbs Ground Beef (12 large patties, 4 meals with leftovers)<br />
</li>
<li>3.19 lbs Salmon (sliced into 2 meal-sized portions)<br />
</li>
<li>9.61 lbs (2) whole Chickens (each ought to be a dinner plus several lunches)</li>
</ul>
<p>That's at least 19 meals not counting leftovers to go with salad for lunch and the breakfasts!</p>
<p>And for the curious, yeah, it's working. I'm down 18 pounds and the Sweet One has shed 20(!) in 40 days. We're both working out regularly, too. This holiday new and smaller clothing will make great presents.</p>
