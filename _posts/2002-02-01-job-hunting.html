<p>I need to do more on this idea. As of today, I've been off work for a year and while this has been a great break, one most people never have a chance to take, the time is coming soon to go back and work. Contribute more than just this weblog/website. Spent time on <a href="http://www.monster.com">Monster.com</a> sending a few resumes and inputting mine to their system. Would be nice if the economy/job market was a little more... robust, shall we say, than the current circumstances but one can't make irrational demands (and expect them to come true). Wish me luck!</p>
