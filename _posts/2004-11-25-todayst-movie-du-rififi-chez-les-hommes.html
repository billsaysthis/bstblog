<p>Roger Ebert <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020901/REVIEWS08/209010301/1023">writes a better review</a> of this awesome 1955 French noir classic than I could. A direct inspiration, along with the contemporaneous <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030525/REVIEWS08/305250301/1023">Bob La Flambeur</a>, for the modern heist genre. Tarantino would never have made <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105236/">Reservoir Dogs</a> without it. Rififi, as its titled in English-speaking countries, has one scene that stands out as terrifically memorable, the actual robbery, which lasts for 28 minutes and has no dialog or music, just the natural sounds of the four men as they break in, disable the alarm and drill into the back of a huge safe. So cool and, for the record, Frank Oz and David Mamet (who both should have known better) should be sentenced to watch this over and over until their eyeballs bleed for making <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0227445/">The Score</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252503/">Heist</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">definitely recommended</span><br /></p>
