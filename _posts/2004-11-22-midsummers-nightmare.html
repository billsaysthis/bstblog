<p>One Summer night, the year I was 14,<br />
<br />The true meaning of terror came clear to me,<br />
<br />As clear as a teenage mind can make it<br />
<br />In the dark, in a nearly empty campground<br />
<br />In the middle of a national park<br />
<br />Further from civilization than this boy<br />
<br />Was comfortable being.</p>
<p>Some point after the Moon swung past the<br />
<br />Highest point in its arc across the sky my<br />
<br />Stomach rumbled so loudly I woke up<br />
<br />Looking for the noise only to feel the pressure<br />
<br />Of a bladder past full and filled with<br />
<br />Urgency, to get to the primitive loo that was<br />
<br />All the campground offered.</p>
<p>Surrounded by a tentfull of other teenage boys<br />
<br />Travelling together across the Western states,<br />
<br />All of them sleeping and none of them<br />
<br />Caring to be disturbed by my troubles<br />
<br />I took care to rise and walk the way you<br />
<br />See in movies, slowly tiptoeing out.</p>
<p>Glancing upward, I got a bit of understanding<br />
<br />Of things I'd only read in books, of the beauty and<br />
<br />Love that open space and open skies and Nature<br />
<br />Bestow on some people fortunate enough to<br />
<br />Pull away from the electrical interference and<br />
<br />Appreciate some different.</p>
<p>The pressure, though, was as urgent as you'd<br />
<br />Imagine so I looked around to find the well-equipped,<br />
<br />Modern as you'd like indoor plumbing facilities<br />
<br />Complete with porcelain sinks and other useful<br />
<br />Inventions, contained inside a capacious grey<br />
<br />Cinder block building.</p>
<p>So I walked across the grounds, with quiet so<br />
<br />Thick you could, as the comedians say, cut it<br />
<br />With a knife, some insects, some birds, though<br />
<br />Not any sound man-made and that was nice,<br />
<br />Almost comforting though having forgotten shoes<br />
<br />My feet were complaining.</p>
<p>Inside I quickly did my business, wanting as much<br />
<br />As anything else just to get back to my cot and sleep<br />
<br />Before the hikes and such that were planned for<br />
<br />Morning until I opened the door and heard a sound<br />
<br />Which wasn't audible on the walk in but got my<br />
<br />Attention really darn fast.</p>
<p>Made me look up too, to see tall bear--brown as I<br />
<br />Remember--about 25 or 30 feet away coming out<br />
<br />From some trees towards me. Not running and he<br />
<br />Wasn't roaring, his noise wasn't that loud but<br />
<br />Fortunately loud enough for me and I<br />
<br />Overcame the shock of recognizing this<br />
<br />Animal before I got too far from perfectly<br />
<br />Good shelter.</p>
<p>Slamming the door, breathing heavy, yes,<br />
<br />Here's a bolt lock in the door, turn it and<br />
<br />Sure enough the bear does come up to the<br />
<br />Other side right away, pushing at it,<br />
<br />Shoving, trying to get inside but<br />
<br />Fortunately for me the construction was<br />
<br />Stronger than him.</p>
<p>All the thoughts racing through my mind<br />
<br />Were wondering if that bear could push past<br />
<br />The lock and get at me, wondering what the<br />
<br />Pain would feel like, how badly I'd be injuried<br />
<br />How long the hurt would stick to my body or<br />
<br />Even if he'd tear off enough for snacking<br />
<br />That I'd die.</p>
<p>Death, that was never in my mind before this<br />
<br />One night, not connected to me but something<br />
<br />Old, grey haired people like my mom's lovely mother,<br />
<br />Grandma Weiner, she died two years before I<br />
<br />Hid from the bear in the bathroom and how much<br />
<br />Time was passing, the animal didn't leave and<br />
<br />I couldn't help myself, couldn't control myself<br />
<br />So I screamed.</p>
<p>I thought I screamed as loudly as my throat<br />
<br />Would go with enough volume to maybe scare<br />
<br />Away the bear or wake up one of the counselors<br />
<br />Leading our trip or one of the other campers<br />
<br />I screamed again and again, just Help Help<br />
<br />Help even when my throat hurt from doing it<br />
<br />But no one heard.</p>
<p>I had no watch and no idea how much time<br />
<br />Was passing but it seemed like ten, twenty<br />
<br />Minutes and the bear was still at the door,<br />
<br />Finally the sounds of his effort slowing down<br />
<br />My screaming probably didn't do much to<br />
<br />Encourage his departure, my salvation, but even<br />
<br />Bears get tired.</p>
<p>And he still was out there, under the sky<br />
<br />Filled with so many stars and a big bright Moon<br />
<br />So different from what you'd see outside my<br />
<br />Suburban window. Maybe my mind snapped<br />
<br />A bit from the pressure of my fear and looked<br />
<br />For a different tack to try since all that<br />
<br />Screaming failed.</p>
<p>The counselors riding herd on the 30 of us<br />
<br />Traipsing across America that Summer were<br />
<br />All Bible College students, maybe six or seven<br />
<br />Years older than us and their belief in Jesus<br />
<br />Wasn't something they pushed on us but they<br />
<br />Were happy to talk about Him and answer<br />
<br />Our silly questions.</p>
<p>Not being a member of their herd, barely still<br />
<br />Belonging to my own and more impressed with<br />
<br />Questions coming from physicists and philosophers<br />
<br />Far from such conservative bents and I often<br />
<br />Told myself I was more interested in pulling at<br />
<br />Hanging threads dangling from inconsistent<br />
<br />Logic in their fables.</p>
<p>But in the moment, in the spaces between<br />
<br />My ineffective unheard screams and scratching<br />
<br />At the door from the beast I remembered, or<br />
<br />Tried to, the message the counselors had given me,<br />
<br />I raised my eyes to the ceiling of my little sanctuary<br />
<br />Then asked Him and His only born Son to<br />
<br />Intercede on my behalf and send the bear away<br />
<br />And save me.</p>
<p>In return I would embrace Him and his<br />
<br />Faith despite the certain reaction of my family<br />
<br />When I delivered this news but in the moment<br />
<br />The bear was much more real to me but the bear<br />
<br />Stayed at the door, for how long I still can't say,<br />
<br />And I couldn't get back to my simple cot in my<br />
<br />Simple tent and I stayed, slumped crying on the<br />
<br />Floor of my sanctuary until daylight finally came<br />
<br />Through the window.</p>
<p>Young as I was, my offer was in return for<br />
<br />His immediate intercession and not 10 or 20 minutes<br />
<br />Or three hours later so I never mentioned my<br />
<br />Thought, the bargain offered up, to these counselor<br />
<br />Instead I yelled at them for days for not waking<br />
<br />Up or having one person on guard while we were in<br />
<br />Such a dangerous place and I remained unchanged<br />
<br />Because as the minutes went by and my screams went<br />
<br />Unanswered I was scared.<br /></p>
