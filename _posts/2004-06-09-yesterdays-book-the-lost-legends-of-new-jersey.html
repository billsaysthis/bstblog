<p>Frederick Reiken grew up in the same town as me, I guess five years behind me in school so I never knew him, but he set his second novel <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~lssd/public/reviews/frm200205.htm">The Lost Legends of New Jersey</a> there and uses all the landmarks from his side of town (Silvermans, Eppes Essen, the Bagel Box) but surprisingly for a novel about teenagers leaves out the <a href="http://www.simon.com/mall/default.aspx?ID=111">Livingston Mall</a>--everyone I know spent plenty of time there in high school but I guess a more or less generic shopping center just doesn't give the same <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~paw/web_exclusives/features/features_02.html">sense of place</a>.</p>
<p>So, the book: Reiken has a great skill with words, I really just enjoyed reading this book independent of the characters or their stories. And while he creates interesting characters--how could I not be engaged by a teenage Jewish boy from Livingston in the late '70s and early '80s?--I should say that this book is more a series of vignettes than a standard novel with plot twists and conclusions. Anthony Rubin, the main character, does come to a bit of maturity over the pages, that's the closest thing to plot here, but I wouldn't want to discourage your interest over this.</p>
<p>This is definitely Literature and I expect there is ample opportunity for applying critical theory and the like though I have no intention of doing so. I'll just point out that while <a href="http://www.hippopress.com/books/080201_newjersey.html">others disagree</a>, I felt his use of instant, no look transitions all through the volume was quite interesting.</p>
<p><em>recommended</em></p>
