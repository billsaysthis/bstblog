<p>We've been taking care of Dinger Dog, our friends' black lab this weekend, and having fun. He's nine years old and very well-behaved, although the parade of dachsunds we encountered while walking him in downtown Los Altos yesterday morning generated a bit of growling. Dinger's going home tonight but not before we take him the dog park at Shoreline Park this afternoon. TS1, of course, is thrilled but even more anxious for us to get (two of) our own.</p>
<p>Dinger says he was just as disappointed as me at Liverpool's 3-1 loss to Arsenal, dropping us from defending our FA Cup title at the first confrontation. Here's a photo of us commiserating at the dog park:</p>
