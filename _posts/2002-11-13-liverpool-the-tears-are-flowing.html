<p>Yesterday was such a complete cockup that I needed 24 hours to relax enough to write about it! The Reds threw themselves out the Champions League window with <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/championsleague/2002/20021112/reports/64308_full.html">a 3-3 draw</a> against FC Basel. Manager G. Houllier stated afterwards that <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/championsleague/news/2002/1113/20021113lfchoullier.html">"we'll be back"</a> and they surely will since all that's required is a fourth place or better Premiership finish.</p>
<p>But the boys have certainly hit a road bump! Yesterday's result looks better than it was as three goals were given up in the first 30 minutes and none were put in the plus column until the second half! Finally the team woke up and made a ferocious charge but to no avail as the Swiss were able to hold Owens and Co. off just enough. So the final group standings are Valencia first and then Basel claiming the other slot in the Round of 16, and Liverpool and Moscow sitting home to sulk.</p>
<p>This followed a very sad weekend loss to Middlesboro, with no goals at all scored, but LFC still stands first in the EPL. Next up is a match at Anfield against Sunderland on Sunday; this should be a relatively easy three points, given the visitor's poor showing all season plus several key injuries, but apparently no match can be taken for granted with the topsy turvy play of late!</p>
