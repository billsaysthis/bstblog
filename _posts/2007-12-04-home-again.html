<p>After a not particularly pleasant airplane experience, which makes me wonder why people told me Air New Zealand is <span style="font-style:italic;">much</span> better than United, TS1 and I are, to quote the great Chuck Berry, "back home in the good old USA." Tired as heck but not really able to fall asleep. Too many good memories banging around in la cabeza.</p>
