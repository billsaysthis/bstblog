<p>One of my good friends, Roxanne Rosales, married her fiance Thomas Sutter recently and they forwarded this picture from the party:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/roxanne_thomas_wedding.jpg" /></p>
<p>Just want to send them my love and best wishes for a long and happy marriage with lots of little ones. My only advice: never go to sleep angry with each other. Congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. Sutter!!</p>
