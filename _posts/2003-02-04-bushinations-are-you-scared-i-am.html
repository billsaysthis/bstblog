<p>Nicholas Kristof's latest Op-Ed column for the NY Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/04/opinion/04KRIS.html">'A Sea of Fire,' or Worse?</a>, presents a chilling scenario on how the Korean Crisis might very well proceed. I'm getting the feeling that Iraq, while an important and probably easier target, should not be the Bush Administration's primary focus any more. How about you? Let the inspectors have more time, Hussein isn't going to get the bomb any time soon. Whereas North Korea will (a few very soon and dozens within no more than a couple of years) and has missiles to deliver warheads throughout most of the Far East, maybe even to the US before much longer.</p>
<p><a href="http://dangerousmeta.com/posts/03/20030204#e">garret</a>, I sure hope you never have to say I told you so on this steaming pile of craptastic planning.</p>
