<p>Dammit! ESPN has switched which of their networks will show tonight's World Cup quarterfinal matches from ESPN2 to ESPN. Of course they did this too late for Tivo to update the program guide and make sure I get them recorded. But Tivo must have gotten a lot of heat for this earlier in the tournament since they posted instructions for setting the recordings up manually. Due to Tivo's stupid use of frames and other inadvised page protection settings, I can't link to their instruction page; if you need them, go to their home page and click on Customer Support, then the headline/announcement is towards the top of the Support page.</p>
<p>Oh do I hate this!</p>
