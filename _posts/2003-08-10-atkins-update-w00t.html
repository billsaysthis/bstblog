<p>11 months, eight days into the diet: 51.5 pounds and 10 waistline inches lost. TS1 is doing quite well, looking very svelte and sexy, as well. This weight is actually one of my major milestones as it is less, by half a pound, than my low weight on my previous Atkins episode in 2000. I hope <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/">Doc</a> and the other bloggers doing Atkins and other weight loss approaches are succeeding too.</p>
