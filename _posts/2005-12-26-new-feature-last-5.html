<p>If you look over in the sidebar (if you're reading this from the RSS feed, click through to the real page) you can  see that both <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/wp/">bill:politics</a> and <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/movies/">bill:moviereviews</a> have Last 5 links. Clicking opens up a block on the main page containing titles of the five latest entries in that blog and, just to keep things tidy, clicking the other Last 5 with one already open simply replaces rather than adding. Of course you need to allow JavaScript for this to work...</p>
