<p>Yesterday the pain in my mouth reached a crescendo that could no longer be ignored and so I overcame my irrational fear and call a dentist. This was probably a good thing since he found that the back of the last molar on the bottom right of my mouth had broken off, causing a nasty infection and finally inflamation in my gums. He also suggested it could be responsible for how extremely tired I've been feeling the last few weeks as my body overspent energy trying to fight off the infection.
