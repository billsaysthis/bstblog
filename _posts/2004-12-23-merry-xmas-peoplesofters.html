<p>Oracle tries to <a href="http://www.oracle.com/peoplesoft/employee.html">spin it</a> the best they can, but the reality is the upcoming closure of the company's acquisition of PeopleSoft is going to dump a few thousand employees on the pavement soon after Jan. 14. The other shoe will drop for the retained staff soon after, I'm sure, as soon as Oracle staff impose their corporate culture.</p>
<p>Happy New Year to us unemployed techies because the extra supply isn't going to help anyone. The resume pile on the desks of hiring managers is going to get that much taller. Swell.<br /></p>
