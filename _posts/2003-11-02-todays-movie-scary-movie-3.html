<p>If you were a fan of the old <a href="http://www.uselessmoviequotes.com/umq_a003.htm">Airplane comedies</a>, you might enjoy <a href="http://www.scarymovie.com/sm3_home.html">Scary Movie 3</a>. That early '80s comedy is probably a better point of reference than the first two <em>Scary</em> films, which shouldn't be too surprising since the Wayans brothers, originators of the series, dropped out and gave control to David Zucker. He wrote and directed <em>Airplane!</em>, then went on to such high brow cinematic achievements as <em>Naked Gun</em>, the Trey Parker/Matt Stone collaboration <em>BASEketball</em> and this year's Ashton Kutcher gem, <em>My Boss's Daughter</em>.</p>
<p><em>SM3</em> is funny, and lots of laughs but really brings very little from the first two movies except Anna Farris, who had supporting roles previously but takes the lead this time alongside Charlie Sheen, Simon Rex, Regina Hall, Zucker regular Leslie Nielsen, and Anthony Anderson (in dreadlocks). Lots of high profile cameos, lots of pop culture references, and a few aliens. Actually has a plot--Zucker and co-authors Pat Proft and Craig Mazen are pros and able to work in the movie parodies without forgetting the movie isn't just a collection of sketches.</p>
