<td>The Sweet One and I have a Sunday ritual. After a tasty breakfast lovingly she prepares, today low carb pancakes amd coffee from Hawaii, we head over to the <a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/living/4197885.htm">award-winning</a> Mountain View Farmer's Market. Not only do we get a variety of lettuces for our lunches, we also usually buy hardy green veggies like bok choy, kale, and broccoli. And since tomorrow is a pot luck lunch at the office, she put together some fresh-picked ingredients for a salad. Here she is getting the cherry tomatoes</td>

<td>One of my favorite vendors at the market is the mushroom man. Unlike some of the stands I never noticed a name sign for this one, so I have my own pet name. Here he's seen waiting for a woman to hand over the money, presiding over luscious piles of fungus, of which I've bought a bagful already. There's always some live, generally acoustic, music at the market, this morning provided by a very eccentric looking woman, or, on second thought, a woman dressed as a green witch for Halloween.</td>

<p>Do you take advantage of your local farmer's market?</p>
