<p><em>The Times</em> continues to print <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/24/opinion/L24GAYS.html">reader letters</a> regarding gay marriage. Most of the letters are as you'd expect, from one side or the other. Donald Leventhal of Chesterland, Ohio states, however, that while the legal benefits of marriage are a reasonable desire (I guess he would agree with granting them), the idea of artifical insemination of a lesbian couple should be outlawed because "How can children who will never meet or even see a picture of their biological father have anything but a great sense of loss and a huge gap in their lives?"</p>
<p>What a doofus. Using his logic, all adoptions and artificial inseminations where the sperm donor is not the man who raises the child should be outlawed as well. The newspaper probably prints such letters to show the range of opinions on a very controversial topic but I wish they'd use a higher standard for selection. Compare it to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/24/opinion/L24MENO.html">a letter</a> responding to a recent OpArt piece on Iraq. Donald Leventhal, you are a doofus and you can quote me on that.</p>
