<p><b>Recent books: Sum of All Fears</b><br />

<p>There's still no good official Clancy book site but Anders Ericson is kind enough to have supplied a <a href="http://hem.passagen.se/clancy/" title="Not updated in a long while">decent one</a> that includes <a href="http://hem.passagen.se/clancy/soaf.htm">this summary</a>. Sum is a pretty gripping tale, not nearly as extensive with the background material as later works of his have gotten. Mainly, I re-read this now since I thought the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0164184">Ben Affleck as Ryan movie version</a> was coming out in August; <a href="http://www.upcomingmovies.com/sumofallfears.html">research</a> shows it as a 2002 movie and further that (a) Ryan, a deputy diretor of the CIA in the novel, is being played as just an analyst in the movie and (b) that the main villains are changed from Palestinean terrorists to neo-Nazis. Inside.com <a href="http://www.inside.com/jcs/Story?article_id=26285&amp;pod_id=10">reported back in in March</a> that Tom Clancy is so happy that Ben Affleck is the new Jack Ryan, that he's working on a new batch of "young Jack Ryan" novels, just so Affleck can someday star in the movie versions.</p>
