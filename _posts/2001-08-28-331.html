<p><b>I knew these guys were bad news</b></p>
<p>Two weeks ago, I wrote that <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_08_12_blog_archive.phtml#5086193">employees should beware</a> of Promethean Investment Group. And I am scared that I'll <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_08_19_blog_archive.phtml#5195155">lost my highspeed 'Net connection</a> if Excite@Home goes under. In a terrible nightmare, the two are coming together, as The Standard reports in <a href="http://www.thestandard.com/article/0,1902,28819,00.html">Creditor Calls on ExciteAtHome</a>; Promethean is calling in $50 million in notes they hold and in a written statement, Excite admitted that if it were forced to repay the notes "it would have a materially adverse impact on the company's liquidity and its ability to fund its operations."  Excite management claims the charges are frivolous and without merit but I'm shaking in my boots for now. Urggh!!!</p>
