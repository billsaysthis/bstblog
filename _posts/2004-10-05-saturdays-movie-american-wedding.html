<p>Vivian gave the movie <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/vivroar/archives/2004_10_03_archive.html#109685814351815924">a moderately good write up</a>. I laughed, after all the creative team are professionals, but overall thought it was formulaic and unoriginal. This third go-round with the <span style="font-style:italic;">American Pie</span> gang dearly missed the pure romanticism of Chris Klein's Oz and Mena Suvari's Heather, the take no shit of Natasha Lyonne's Heather and the sexuality of Shannon Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Director Jesse Dylan (Bob's other son) and writer Adam Herz tried to simplify the stories and compress the missing characteristics, especially the romance, into Jason Biggs' Jim and Alyson Hannigan's Michelle but that removed what was interesting and different about the previous editions.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">not recommended</span><br /></p>
