<p>Speaking of this week's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame celebration, Bruce Springsteen gave <a href="http://www.u2.com/news/index.php?mode=full&amp;news_id=1358" title="U2 posted the transcript">an impassioned, loving yet somewhat intellectual speech</a> welcoming U2 to the ranks. He connected them musically and thematically to some of the other greats of rock and soul, trying a bit too much for a laugh by mentioning one of his own efforts, but overall delivering a terrific tribute and returning the favor after Bono did the same for the Boss in 1999.</p>
<p>Highlight: Springsteen surprised a lot of people, including me, by describing the Edge as perhaps the greatest unsung guitar hero in rock. Not that he isn't right, just that we rarely think of him that way, but Bruce put Edge up with "<span style="font-style:italic;">Jimi Hendrix, Chuck Berry, Neil Young, Pete Townshend--guitarists who defined the sound of their band and their times.</span>"</p>
<p>For their performance the band played <span style="font-style:italic;">I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For</span> (Bruce joining in on guitar and vocals), <span style="font-style:italic;">Until the End of the World</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Pride</span> (matched well with Bono's recollection during his acceptance speech of death threats received during a tour in the American South while they were part of the successful campaign to have Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday established as a national holiday) and <span style="font-style:italic;">Vertigo</span>.</p>
<p>TS1 pointed out that U2 is the only top rock band to last so long without a single change in personnel and she seems correct to me, which is really amazing arithmetic. Solo artists like hall of famers Dylan, Clapton and Costello can't figure in here. Think about it:
<ul>
<li>The Beatles and Led Zeppelin made no changes but their recording careers lasted less than a decade and 12 years respectively;</li>
<li>the Stones are missing two originals, Brian Jones and Bill Wyman, as well as short termer Mick Taylor;</li>
<li>R.E.M., which came to prominence at the same time as the Irish lads, almost made it but lost Bill Berry to long term effects of his brain aneurism; and,</li>
<li>the E Street Band is down two originals (Vinny Lopez and David Sancious plus Steve Van Zandt left for awhile too) and have only worked sporadically with Bruce anyway (technically they are only given cover credit on the concert releases, <span style="font-style:italic;">Live 1975-1985</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Live in New York City</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Live in Barcelona</span>, but at least one member worked on each of his record).</li>
<li>Aerosmith, <a href="http://www.rockhall.com/hof/inductee.asp?id=1138">class of 2003</a>, come within a whisker but miss out due to a nasty interregnum when Joe Perry and Brad Whitford left for about five years.  </li>
<li>ZZ Top, inducted into the Rock Hall last year, are perhaps the closest to meeting the U2 test though one might suggest their last hit was 1983's <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:qdjv7i3jg71r">Eliminator</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p> TS1 and I just cannot wait, the next 20 days until U2 hit the HP Pavilion stage with us in the audience feels like an eternity!</p>
