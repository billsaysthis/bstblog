<p>I don't find myself reading too many longer how-to pieces on marketing, I find they're generally too abstract, too out of sync with my way of thinking regardless of which is right/better or, because marketing is not a core part of my work, too disconnected from what I do. (Of course, as soon as I wrote the last part of that sentence I recognized how wrong it is but will leave it as a lesson for others to learn from.) For quite some time I've been reading blog posts praising Seth Godin as one of the seminal new thinkers in marketing but still, for one of these three reasons, not read anything by him longer than a blog post.</p>
<p>Then an hour ago I saw a pointer to <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/09/free_ebook_1_no.html">KnockKnock</a>, a free, <em>short</em> ebook by Godin and thought I'd take a stab on a slow Saturday afternoon. Not only did I finish reading it in an hour (not that hard since it's a 41 page PDF with several pages taken up by ads for other publications by him, some large graphics and similarly skimmed matter), I tagged it to RawSugar, sent an email to a co-worker insisting he read it and write this blog post.</p>
<p>Godin's writing, I'm sorry to be so late in recognizing, is accessible, practical and insightful. If I were in his line of work, he'd be my Bruce Springsteen or Willie Mays--or maybe decide to find a new career. Thankfully I do something different and can just appreciate the style and learn the lessons.</p>
