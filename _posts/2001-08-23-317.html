<p><b>eBay: a stock worth its price?</b><br />

<p>Smartass Christopher Byron in <a href="http://www.observer.com/pages/envelope.asp">this week's installation</a> of Back of the Envelope on The New York Observer explains why eBay, even though trading at a (high for these days) 83 times year-ahead earnings, is the one dotcom to survive the carnage; the short answer is they get money from real people and not other dotcom/tech companies. This column has an excellent, brief, <em>precise</em> explanation of the tech stock crash, one of the best I've read.</p>
<p>Note: there's no permalink yet for this article, but an <a href="http://www.observer.com/pages/story_lookup.asp?story=Back%20of%20the%20Envelope">index of all his columns</a> is online.</p>
