<p><b>The Wackiness continues</b><br />

<p>As <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_07_29_blog_archive.phtml#4891064">previously reported</a>, the marketing humanoids at <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a> (the big Linux vendor) are continuing their comic series of beta update announcements with <a href="http://lwn.net/daily/rh-roswell-2.php3">Roswell: the second sighting - available now</a>. As 'one scientist said: "I mean, this stuff just fell out of the sky! Any computer you install this on could start being used by THEM to construct sophisticated mind-control devices. Or, more likely, it would just catch fire and melt down. However, if that does happen, we'd want to know about it."</p>
