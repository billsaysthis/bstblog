<p>[A letter to the editor at the Mercury News in response to <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/columnists/joe_rodriguez/9511093.htm">this absurd column</a>]</p>
<p>Once again Joe Rodriguez writes a column asking us to put aside the rule of law. Rodriguez cites the benefits of having illegals here, doing work legal residents won't and therefore boosting our economy. So I guess he would also be okay if we had a Robin Hood-style crew here in the Valley who specifically stole things out of rich people's safes that were just sitting there, doing nothing to help the economy, and turning over the proceeds to a good cause. Because the column (yet again) tells us that laws can be broken if the criminal has a good reason.</p>
<p>Joe, if you want to get more people here legally, then work within the system to change the law. Don't rationalize illegal activity or ask others to cover their eyes while it happens. Perhaps the proposals from both major parties aren't getting the attention you'd like but that doesn't mean the ideas aren't there.<br /></p>
