<p>And the answer is yes. In "The Dell Dude Graduates" (my title) <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/en/dhs/topics/segtopic_steven_whois.htm">Steven</a> uses slides of himself posing as a moron giving what seems to be the valedictory address. With any luck this graduation means the end of the <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/en/dhs/topics/segtopic_steven_home.htm">ad series</a> but somehow I doubt it. Sad how advertising execs come up with something funny and then abuse it into the ground.</p>
