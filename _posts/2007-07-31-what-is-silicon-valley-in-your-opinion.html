<p>This came up in an email discussion with <a href="http://www.crabapples.net/rob/">Rob</a> last week and seems like one of those things that everyone's got an opinion on, like what the acronym <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss#History">RSS</a> expands to.</p>
<p>For my money Silicon Valley is:
<ul>
<li>no further north than Menlo Park (this is perhaps the most contentious border, leaving out Redwood City and Redwood Shores, e.g., Oracle)</li>
<li>east to Milpitas</li>
<li>south from Los Gatos to south San Jose</li>
<li>west from Menlo Park to Los Gatos</li>
</ul>
<p>I used Google's My Maps feature to create <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=110028793299624058626.00043696c8ad087ef4418&amp;ll=37.34778,-121.981201&amp;spn=0.251641,0.6427&amp;z=11&amp;om=1">this illustrative map</a>. Why don't you post your own?</p>
