<p>For the last few years I've watched the International Mystery series on <a href="http://kcsm.org/tv">KCSM</a> (a public television station associated run by the San Mateo County Community College District). The series rotates through many Western European crime series including the original (Swedish) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallander_(Swedish_TV_series)">Wallander</a>, <a href="http://www.mhznetworks.org/option,com_worldviewchannels/Itemid,146/sid,2467/lindex,d/">Detective Montalbano</a> from Sicily and the long-running German <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatort" title="And by longrunning I mean since 1970!">Tatort</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> This has been running Monday nights at 10 with a repeat around 3 or 4 a.m. but the KCSM website shows them as moving to Sundays at 6 and 9 p.m. and a repeat on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>I really like the differences from typical American series. To a degree these shows are similar to what we get on the cable networks, not including the nudity--which is blurred--and profanity--which is not in the subtitles--in that the ending is not always neat and the protagonists don't just get or find all the answers.</p>
<p>There's also much more time spent on the main characters' personal life. I wonder if this is down to smaller budgets but even so it makes the series' more engaging.</p>
<p>Fortunately the shows are never dubbed into English, which generally throws me off due to the lack of synchronization of sound and image, and with today's large flatscreens subtitles aren't a bother. KCSM always blocks two hours for this but the shows are never more than 96 minutes.</p>
<p>Currently we're getting <em>Montalbano</em>, a detective from the House school of crankypants; <a href="http://www.mhznetworks.org/option,com_worldviewchannels/Itemid,146/sid,2855/lindex,d/">Donna Leon: Commissario Guido Brunetti Mysteries</a>, which is set in Venice but filmed in German; <a href="http://www.mhznetworks.org/option,com_worldviewchannels/Itemid,146/sid,3412/lindex,v/">Van Veeteren</a>, a kindly old retired Swedish cop; Detective Inspector Irene Huss, an attractive middle-aged married mother of two Swedish cop; and the classic French flic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Maigret">Maigret</a> in a French television adaptation, though I think his run is done for now as no episodes are set for July or August.</p>
