<p>As yet another little programming exercise (using Eris's Ngeblog library) I created an <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/BillSaysThisBookReviews">RSS 2.0 feed</a> of just my <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/books">book reviews</a>. The intial impetus came from reading Kris Hadlock's article <a href="http://www.webreference.com/authoring/languages/xml/rss/custom_feeds/index.html">Creating a Custom RSS Feed with PHP and MySQL</a> though my code is substantially different since I already had the key data in my own table schema and, of course, use the Blogger GData API to pull in the full post body as description.</p>
<p>You may notice that the feed is served through <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">FeedBurner</a>; I used their service to make it more accessible and also because to do so I had to go through the exercise of making it <a href="http://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbillsaysthis.com%2Fcontent%2Fmisc%2Fbooks-rss.php">validate</a>, which was a bit of a PITA but just more learning for me.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Enjoy!</span></p>
