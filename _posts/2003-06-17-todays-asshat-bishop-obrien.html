<p>Run someone over with your car and speed away from the scene. In a panic, many of us might do that driven by our fight or flight instincts. A high ranking official of the Roman Catholic Church, though, is supposed to fall into the "know better" group. <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/0616obrien-fatality-ON.html">Apparently not</a>. Hey, even someone like a bishop might panic but I'd still expect him to call the police after getting home and having a few minutes to calm down and to think the matter over. Again, not Thomas J. O'Brien. Then again, this killing (I refuse to call these things accidents) took place mere days after the man barely escaped prosecution for his part in covering up child molesting by priests in his charge.</p>
