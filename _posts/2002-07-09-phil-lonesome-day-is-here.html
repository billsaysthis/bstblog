<p>Web buddy <a href="http://www.philringnalda.com/main/">Phil R</a>, he of the ingenious <a href="http://philringnalda.com/archives/002114.php">Archive Script Generator</a>, asked for a reminder when the second new <a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/">Boss</a> track was available.  Despite the odd filename, <a href="http://demand1.stream.aol.com/ramgen/aol/us/aolmusic/artists/sony/mozart/mozart_pianoconcerto_web.rm">it's here</a>. And title song <a href="http://demand1.stream.aol.com/ramgen/aol/us/aolmusic/artists/sony/brucespringstein/brucespringstein_therising_web.rm">The Rising</a> can be heard as well.</p>
<p>What do I think of Lonesome Day? It's good, got interesting lyrics, and some nice guitar work; decent but not a killer. But it is part of a general trend I've noticed lately regarding Bruce's music: it's slower. Even the older songs, when played in concert, seem to get this treatment which to me dates back to the Human Touch/Lucky Town releases. This newest tune feels like the band is playing at 3/4 tempo though The Rising doesn't feel quite so off-pace; Max's drums are more rigidly tuned and the acoustic guitar doesn't come as high in the mix. And what's up with so much acoustic guitar anyway? Does Patti have to be heard playing it on every song? If the order of release of these two songs had been released, I would have been in the dumps two weeks ago.</p>
