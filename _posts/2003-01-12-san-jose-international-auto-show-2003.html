<p>Evan and I decided to kill an afternoon downtown yesterday at the 2003 <a href="http://www.sjautoshow.com/">San Jose International Auto Show</a>. You can see some of what I liked in a new <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=sjautoshow2003">photo gallery</a>. Too bad Evan couldn't fit into either of his first choices, the Nissan 350Z or the Ford Thunderbird, but that's one of the drawbacks of being so tall.</p>
<p>Cool cars: <a href="http://www.saleen.com/auto/s7/S7con.htm">Saleen S7</a>, <a href="http://www.nissanusa.com/vehicles/ModelHomePage/0,,24109,00.html">Nissan Murano</a>, and the always hot <a href="http://www.acura.com/models/nsx_index.asp?section=home&amp;page=index">Acura NSX</a>.</p>
<p>Odd cars: <a href="http://www.cardesignnews.com/autoshows/2002/newyork/highlights/h02-toyota-scion.html">Toyota Scion</a> <a href="http://www.roadandtrack.com/images/imageDisplay.asp?img=/images/rt_images/autoshows/2002_nyias/2002_nyias_toyota_scion_bbx_spawner.jpg">bbX</a> and <a href="http://www.cardesignnews.com/autoshows/2002/newyork/highlights/images/scion-ccxfrt02.jpg">ccX</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, not as exciting as one would hope. Lots of nearly identical SUVs. There are no more plain sedans anymore, there are only sport sedans except at the very high end. The timing of the San Jose show has to be questioned since <a href="http://www.auto.com/2003show/">the biggest show of the year</a>, in Detroit, is also being held this week and that means all the good concept cars are unavailable. (The Times has a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/12/automobiles/12SHOW-WEB.html">good write up</a>) What, they couldn't hold this off for two or three weeks?</p>
