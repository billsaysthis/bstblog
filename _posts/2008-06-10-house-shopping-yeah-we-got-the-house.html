<p>The closing was six days late and let's just say there's very little plumbing present now that was there two weeks ago, but we're really excited and packing fast because Thursday is moving day.</p>
<p>The contractors have been pretty good so far. Not cheap but the work looks good. All of them worked over the weekend too, to help us meet the schedule. I'll know for sure in a month but I'd probably giver referrals for each one (plumbing, electrical, roofing, flooring and general purpose work).</p>
<p>One positive thing about being around to answer questions and such is I've had plenty of time to spend on Insoshi. Working with Ruby on Rails again, especially in a meaningful way like this, is a lot of fun.</p>
<p>More soon, I'm sure.</p>
