<p>How sad is the state of journalism today that major publications feel the need to 'out' the guy who messed up at last night's Cubs-Marlins game by interfering with a a fly ball? Okay, the guy was foolish to do this but does that mean he deserves to be subject to national ridicule? Surely having total strangers refer to him as that idiot or that moron, or similar but less family-oriented, is sufficient. I wonder if one of the late night TV idiots (yes you, Leno) will be grubby enough to use the guy's name. From the reports I saw the man is otherwise intelligent and good-natured and doesn't deserve the infamy. Fucking pandering journalists.</p>
