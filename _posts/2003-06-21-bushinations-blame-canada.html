<p>Well, not really, of course, but our own special GWB today <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/politics/politics-iraq-usa-bush.html">explained the away</a> the failure of American forces in Iraql to find any bio or chem weapons by claiming that looters must have stripped all the sites and all the documents. But gee Prez, if the bad men took the weapons (and why would they give enough of a shit about the documentation to take it too?), and those forces are the ones killing one American soldier a day on the ground there, how come none of the stuff has been used yet? Puh-leeze!</p>
