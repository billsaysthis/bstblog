<p>Dammit, the classic 1965 French docudrama <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058946/">The Battle of Algiers</a> is on IFC right now but not again within the two weeks of listings TiVo has in memory. Makes me wonder, additionally, why the system has no Add to Wishlist choice on the program detail screen. I need to check OnDemand later and see if the movie's available through the service.</p>
