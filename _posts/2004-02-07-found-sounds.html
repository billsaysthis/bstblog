<p>Yesterday's <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_02_01_blog_archive.phtml#107611653976482783">bit of doggerel</a>, just to give a spot of explanation, was an exercise in combining found bits of dialog, remembered lyrics and out of context sentence fragments from news articles. Hopefully at least one of you found it to have some emotional resonance.</p>
