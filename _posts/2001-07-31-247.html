<p><b>Yesterday's book: A Painted House</b><br />

<p>Imagine a novel by John Grisham. It's set somewhere in the South (with a capital S), has a young (possibly 30-ish) struggling lawyer as our hero, and eventually Our Hero beats the bad/corupt/murderous lawyers or judges. Every single one of them, 11in all, have been bestsellers. And with nothing left to prove but that he has real talent and not just commercial skills, Grisham reared back, typed hard, and pulled this <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/features/grisham/">sweet, sensitive story</a> out of his back pocket. Or maybe the pocket of his Cardinals jacket--baseball references are certainly valid with this semi-autobiographical book. While I liked this book, <a href="http://www.compulsivereader.com/article1009.html">others disagree</a>, silly them.</p>
<p>Best film of a Grisham novel is still the first one, <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0106918">The Firm</a> with Tom Cruise. If you're a really big fan of this author, check out the <a href="http://library.msstate.edu/grisham_room/grisham.htm">John Grisham Room</a> on the campus of Mississippi State University, which contains papers and materials donated by the Mississippi State University alumnus.</p>
<p>Big shout out to the infamous <a href="http://home.pacbell.net/bnevins/">Choadmaster</a> for loaning me the book.</p>
