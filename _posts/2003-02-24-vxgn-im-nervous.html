<p>I know, it's only 12.5 hours until the <a href="http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=VXGN&amp;script=410&amp;layout=-6&amp;item_id=384961">big announcement</a> on the trial results. Are they good, are they bad, are they outstanding? I don't know. But I hate this kind of waiting. And the news media, just doing their jobs and not to be blamed, are only making things worse by running stories saying the announcement is coming tomorrow. A big strawberry on the Mercury News, though, for running a <a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/5239038.htm" title="Linked article will be unavailable after 1 March 2003">front page story</a> yesterday that's heavily slanted to the negative! Bill is just not a good waiter, I get the same way when almost any big news is pending, just haven't learned to live with it.</p>
