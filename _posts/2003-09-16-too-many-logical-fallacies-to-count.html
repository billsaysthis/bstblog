<p>[Another Letter to the Editor of the SJ Mercury News I've submitted regarding <a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/opinion/6783552.htm">this column</a> by Joe Rodriguez entitled <em>'Colorblind' Ward Connerly has a case of selective vision</em>]</p>
<p>I've been reading Joe Rodriguez's OpEd pieces in the MN for some time now and am a bit confused. In today's column for instance, he writes:</p>
<p>"That's right, we should be able to throw innocent children out of school because their parents jumped the border rather than starve."</p>
<p>So I guess Rodriguez is arguing that any individual who has a principled objection to any law can disobey that law. If I can't find work, I should be able to rob a grocery store to put food on my table rather than starve?</p>
<p>I thought that in situations where one disagrees with the law, one obeys the laws as they are and works to change them. Further, I'm not clear that people in Mexico are actually starving, so this column throws emotional tinder on the fire simply because it reinforces his position. If the truth is otherwise, why is the Merc not reporting it? Why is Rodriguez sitting in a comfortable office in San Jose rather than getting the story down south?</p>
