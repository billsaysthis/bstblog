<p>I was over at <a href="http://www.michaelsatshoreline.com">Michael's at Shoreline</a> this afternoon and driving home along Shoreline Boulevard the real nature of the vacant commercial real estate space flood here in Mountain View. Looked like nearly every commercial building had a For Lease sign out front except for the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum</a>. Which of course used to be Silicon Graphics' main office building.</p>
