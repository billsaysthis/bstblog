<p>David Coursey: <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1631580,00.asp">A Dozen Things Outlook Doesn't Do--but Should</a></p>
<p>I only really agree with #1 on his list. Anyway there are some annoying bugs that need fixing first. Do you use the space bar to read messages in the preview window? I do, and the way Outlook sometimes loses its place and skips to the next message can be really frustrating when I'm in the middle of a long email.</p>
<p>Second, being able to read all messages as plain text is nice but why can't it remember when I've told it to read specific messages as HTML with graphics shown? Third, the junk mail filter should give an option to block a sender's domain rather than just a single address. Fourth, threaded conversations. Okay, the last three are new features, not bugs, I suppose, not on your list but not features I can buy or download from other vendors like RSS, Plaxo and so forth that are mentioned.<br /></p>
