<p>Declan McCullagh, writing for C|Net News, has a couple of important columns recently: <a href="http://news.com.com/2010-1071-983921.html?tag=macintouch">Ashcroft's worrisome spy plans</a> and <a href="http://news.com.com/2010-1071-984792.html?tag=fd_nc_1">Closer to a national ID plan?</a>. The former is an overview of "a whopping 120-page proposal [from the Attorney General] that represents the boldest attack yet on our electronic privacy" while the latter alerts us to the plans of a company called <a href="http://www.eaglecheck.com/">EagleCheck</a> which wants to create, in effect, a national identity system based on, and linking, existing databases.</p>
<p>And others are picking up on the trend as well (of course): Privacy International is holding a <a href="http://www.privacyinternational.org/activities/stupidsecurity/">Stupid Security Competition</a>. Send in your nominations.</p>
<p>These are bad things, people, if you want to keep any semblance of a private life. Of course, if you're not doing anything wrong (some would argue), why worry about who knows this stuff? And if you are doing anything wrong, shame on you! Just another move by the allegedly freedom-loving people running our country these days. Who seem to be glad to give you any freedom you want as long as they can watch.</p>
