<p>I installed WordPress at work today and man, that was unbelievably easy; can't point you to it since it's behind the firewall. They claim to have a Blogger import tool, the instructions are pretty straightforward, and if it doesn't choke on my 3,000+ entries this might be the time I change systems. We'll see.</p>
