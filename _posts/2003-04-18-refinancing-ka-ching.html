<p>Gotta love those lower mortgage rates, though I see they're on the way back up since I locked in last month. Anywho, today was paper signing day; for those of you not here in Cali, let's just say for all that this state is known for being eco-friendly, we kill trees by the truckload and the stack of papers just to refinance a mortgage is a stack inches thick of mostly 11"x14" sheet, single-sided of course. You can imagine how much thicker the stack is when purchase of the property is added in!</p>
<p>Wells Fargo keeps offering me zero cost deals, the only thing I see is lower monthly payments (and a reset of the clock back to 30 years) and the possibility of a higher rate (I use a five year ARM). Hell, this time the mortgage broker called me to see if I was interested, didn't even have to pick up a phone, no new docs required, just bending the elbow to sign or intitial all those pages. Lowered my nut another $110 per month, not shabby.</p>
