<p>Frank Rich makes, in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/03/arts/03rich.html?ex=1254283200&amp;en=90e435799b47faa7&amp;amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">Now on DVD: The Passion of the Bush</a>, an amazing assertion about the beliefs of Bush supporters that would not have occured to me in a million years:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><em>Bush is not merely a sincere man of faith but God's essential and irreplaceable warrior on Earth.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>These people are not only serious, they're deadly. MetaFilter, for instance, has the occasional thread/debate on religion, particularly religion in a public space, and most frequently the (almost always Christian) people posting comments favorable to the religious viewpoint keep saying that those on the opposite side are overstating the influence of fringe-level public figures or undervaluing the contribution of belief.</p>
<p>Then I look at the people in positions of power in the US these days and think to myself (since the people of faith never directly respond to such comments) that my fellow MeFites are kidding themselves or being intentionally obtuse. Seriously, who is kidding who? If the Universe actually has a Creator, there is no way in hell (so to speak) that such a being would choose a loser like George W. Bush as a vehicle. I'm not perfect nor are any other members of my species but on any scale you care to use for measuring there are far better candidates. Mysterious ways my ass.<br /></p>
