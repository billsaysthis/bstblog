<p>The one time in recent months that I didn't Alt-A, Alt-C a copy of my post before hitting the Publish button of course is the one time when the system screws up and loses it! Uck-fay!</p>
<p>"The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.<br />
<br />Please contact the server administrator, root@ssdhcp-10-32-56-65.corp.google.com and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that may have caused the error.</p>
<p>More information about this error may be available in the server error log."</p>
<p>Anything I might have done? So now clicking the Publish button would cause an error? Or perhaps Google's servers didn't like the political tone of the post. At least it wasn't a hugely long one and I can retype it without too much trouble. Still: Uck-fay!</p>
<p><em>Five seconds later:</em> Or, amusingly enough, perhaps not. As soon as I hit the Post button (after carefully copying it to the Clipboard) for this entry--for non-blogger users, the difference is that Post stores the entry into the Blogger database while the Publish button does that as well as generating the HTML that is sent to the public page--I saw that the 'missing' entry was sitting right where it should be. Which is better than losing it but not what I would call thrilling.</p>
