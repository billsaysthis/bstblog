<p><b>New photos posted</b></p>
<p>The more observant of you may have noticed a new gallery on the navigation bar at left, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/galleries/odds_ends.phtml">Odds and Ends</a>. Included are photos that don't really fit elsewhere, like one of <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/galleries/odds_ends.phtml?pic=joel_mitch_bill.jpg">Joel Henderson, Mitch Scaff, and myself</a> at the Jan. 1998 NetDynamics Holiday Party at the New Coconut Grove in San Francisco and this one of <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/galleries/odds_ends.phtml?pic=antelopes.jpg">two 'naughty' antelopes</a>. I also found a picture of <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/misc/family_pics.phtml?pic=jo_blarneystone_00.jpg">my sister at the Blarney Stone</a> (the real one in Ireland) and added it to the Family and Friends gallery.</p>
