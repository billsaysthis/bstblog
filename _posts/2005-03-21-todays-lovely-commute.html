<p>Had a bit of excitement this morning driving north on Rengstorf in the left lane to 101 and work. The 10 year old Jeep in front of me was being driven porrly by a woman; her left blinker was on for about a mile though she never turned, her speed was erratic and she occasionally veered slightly to one side or the other. I thought she was on a cell, drinking coffee or some other slightly distracting non-driving activity but can't really say for sure.</p>
<p>All of which had me paying an extra level of attention which turned out to be a good call when, just before we reached the Costco intersection, the woman rear ended a nice 2001 or so maroon Camry. Hard enough to snap the Toyota's trunk open and send some plastic flying. Didn't see any blood spurting.</p>
<p>There was a lot of traffic around us but after a few seconds the right lane cleared and the driver behind me and I could shift over and get passed. Neither driver looked incapacitated or to be screaming in pain so I drove on.</p>
<p>A very pragmatic lesson in why defensive driving is always a good thing. Other drivers are outside your sphere of control and can't be trusted to do the right thing, make the right choice; tow truck drivers and doctors are nice people to have around but better to never need them.</p>
