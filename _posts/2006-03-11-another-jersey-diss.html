<p><a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/soccer/03/10/bc.soc.redbull.newjerse.ap/">Officials seeing red over MetroStars' name change</a> and I don't blame them. It's bad enough that two NFL teams have played in my home state for 30 years without ever officially acknowledging it but for this MLS franchise to try and pull the same stunt is just sad. Especially the weak ass justification offered by team president/GM (and Rutgers alumni) Alexi Lalas:<br />
<blockquote><i>"There are companies all over the world that recognize this point about New York," Lalas said. "Other teams that play in Giants Stadium also reflect this."</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah and when your team can build a beautiful new stadium for itself without feeding off the New Jersey taxpayers, let's talk again. The club plays in New Jersey because in the entire Metro area, that's where the fans are. And if you think people outside the US (and why should what they do or do not know matter anyway?) don't recognize New Jersey then you better hire some pollsters who know how to do their job.</p>
<p>All this stupidity means is the MLS is deader to me than last month's uneaten banana. You can have your Red Bull New York and Houston Dynamo. Liverpool forever, Anfield rules!</p>
