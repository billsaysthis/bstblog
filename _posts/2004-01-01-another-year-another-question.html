<p>The last page has been turned over on another calendar<br />
<br />Another faux important milestone has been passed<br />
<br />Fix the collar on your shirt, flick the dirt off your shoe<br />
<br />Watch the woman with the floppy orange hat throw her<br />
<br />Hands in the air--does she even care?</p>
<p>The Earth rocks here and there in and out of the<br />
<br />Ring of Fire and the Man in Black has passed into<br />
<br />Another plane of existence, singing songs his Momma<br />
<br />Taught him, to a new audience no less appreciative<br />
<br />Of talent and passion--does he even care?</p>
<p>The telephone rings in another room and no one<br />
<br />Hears either end of the conversation though the<br />
<br />Conversants give their all to embed purposeful thought<br />
<br />Into the other's mind and evoke another reaction,<br />
<br />Precious partings of a company--do they even care?</p>
<p>The clocks strike 12, midnight midnight midnight, and<br />
<br />In another timezone people kiss, people hug, people<br />
<br />Grab onto one another and the stop to fix their clothes<br />
<br />When someone shouts to pump up the volume<br />
<br />But no one does--do we even care?</p>
<p>Can we see Reality and understand Time or are they<br />
<br />Another Illusion borne out of the fundamental disconnect<br />
<br />Between the Rider and the Horse? I play another hand of<br />
<br />Cards with a dealer I can't see behind a TV screen<br />
<br />Showing a 22 men running--do I even care?</p>
