<p>Alexi Lalas, president and GM of the SJ Earthquakes, is having <a href="http://sanjose.earthquakes.mlsnet.com/MLS/news/team_news.jsp?ymd=20041216&amp;content_id=20303&amp;vkey=news_sje&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;team=sje">an online chat</a> with fans Monday morning and I sent in the following:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Who will be playing upfront in 2005 next to Brian Ching? Even if [Arturo] Alvarez and [Brian] Mullan are on the team website roster listing as forwards, they've almost always played as wingers and neither seems to have the combination of speed and finishing touch to compliment Ching's toughness and targetability.</p></blockquote>
<p>After losing forwards Donovan, Jamil Walker and Chris Brown from the squad, not to mention captain Jeff Agoos (traded to Metrostars) and Ramiro Corrales (signed with a top Norwegian club) from defense, the Quakes have 10 picks in the Jan. 14 MLS draft which Lalas and coach Dominic Kinnear will need to use very wisely if the team is to continue last season's drop in the table. Kinnear <a href="http://sanjose.earthquakes.mlsnet.com/MLS/news/team_news.jsp?ymd=20041214&amp;content_id=20176&amp;vkey=news_sje&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;team=sje">gave a Q&amp;A</a> recently but no meaningful specifics were included.<br /></p>
