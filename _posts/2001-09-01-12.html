<p><b>Short and to the point</b></p>
<p>Only two days after being delisted from NASDAQ, NetObjects issued a <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/newsarticle.asp?siteid=myyahoo&amp;sid=147740&amp;guid=%7BE477E8D1%2D8494%2D4F1D%2D9E46%2D4F41AFD675B6%7D">two sentence press release</a>:</p>
<p>"REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Sep 1, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- NetObjects, Inc. today announced that it will cease operations effective today. The Company intends to sell its assets as expeditiously as circumstances permit."</p>
<p>Four years ago IBM purchased 51% of this company and we at NetDynamics thought of it as an important competitor, but almost immediately it fell by the wayside. Per the <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/secarticle.asp?&amp;sid=147740&amp;symb=NETO&amp;siteid=mktw&amp;guid=%7B81047352%2D5D3E%2D4611%2DB764%2D0A119113DD6A%7D&amp;type=10003">latest 10-Q filing</a>, IBM owned 48% but there is no statement from them about this.</p>
