<p><b>Will the Bay Area host the 2012 Summer Olympics?</b><br />

<p>I hope not since it will make living here <a href="http://www.mich.com/~drhanna/eighthours.htm" title="Not really relevant but I love this stuff">miserable</a> (traffic will be screwed, restaurants will be packed, security will be everywhere) but there's a committee organized to make it happen, <a href="http://www.basoc2012.org/">BASOC 2012</a>. The site doesn't have too much info yet and is poorly implemented in Flash but the committee is steaming ahead with fundraising, preparing the bid (the US Olympic Committee will select the American candidate city next March), and raising awareness (a couple of BASOC leaders were on NPR this morning). For example, the committee has partnered with Stanford University for a new <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/06/08/SP213232.DTL">100,000 seat stadium</a> on campus; they also hope to build a shooting facility in San Jose, which sounds like and <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=oxymoron">oxymoron</a> to me. All to the good, the bid's success is doubtful; if Toronto doesn't get the 2008 Olympics, that city will most likely get it for 2012.</p>
