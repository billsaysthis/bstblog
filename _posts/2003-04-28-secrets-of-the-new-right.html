<p>In an impressive cover story for <a href="http://www.thenation.com/">The Nation</a>, William Greider uncovers the Right's plan for <a href="http://www.thenation.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20030512&amp;s=greider">Rolling Back the 20th Century</a>. Greider is an amazing writer--just check out some of his previous books like <a href="http://www.book.nu/0671675567">Secrets of the Temple</a> and <a href="http://www.rosezone.com/booksales/im_100/image035-JPEG.html">Who Will Tell The People</a>--and he has an unusual ability to get people to really talk to him, even if on reading you'd think that such openness is against the person's best interests.</p>
<p>Most of the effort being made by those who politically oppose the Bush Administration either focuses on foriegn policy issues like <a href="http://www.warfilter.com/">Iraq</a> and globalization or on single points of contention like <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/25396">Patriot II</a> or <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">digital rights</a>. Not to say that none of those are important but by focusing in such narrow ways the Left, which really does remain the bulk of the American polity, is missing the forest for the trees. Greider's article shows that the leaders of the Right are not making the same mistake but instead have realized "that three steps forward, two steps back still adds up to forward progress."</p>
<p>The article, especially towards the end, gives some tantalizing clues that Greider believes he understands the way to combat the "Stalinist discipline" and I'll support your bill if you support my bill work ethic of the Right. In other words, it reads like a teaser trailer for a new book and, with a little Googling, I found he does indeed have something on topic coming in late Summer: <em>The Soul of Capitalism: Opening Paths to a Moral Economy</em>. Put this one down on my must-read list.</p>
