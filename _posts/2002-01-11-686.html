<p><strong>New tools can be as fun as toys</strong></p>
<p>I was asked this morning if I'd like to try the new Radio Userland 8 release candidate and decided to give it a whirl. You can see the results at <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001296/">billsaysthis on ru8</a>. RU is a content management system, about to be available for $39.95 a year, from Userland Software, which also sells Manila. Not too clear on the differences between the products. Userland is the company <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> founded. garret has a <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001246/stories/2002/01/10/initialReviewOfRadio8.html">more comprehensive writeup</a> of RU8. Seems like a good idea but I wonder if I can import my Blogger archives.</p>
