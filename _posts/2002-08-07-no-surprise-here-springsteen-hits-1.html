<p>Yes, the rumors are true: <em>The Rising</em> will debut at Numero Uno on the Billboard Top 200 Album Chart this week, selling about 526,000 copies for the best debut of Bruce's career. This is the third Springsteen album to debut at No. 1 ("Greatest Hits" and "Live 1975-1985" also bowed in the top spot).</p>
<p>Tonight is the first show of the tour. As always, the opener is at Continental Arena in East Rutherford, NJ, more or less Bruce's home venue. Only 20 days until I go to heaven (usually known as Compaq Center at San Jose) and see him myself!</p>
