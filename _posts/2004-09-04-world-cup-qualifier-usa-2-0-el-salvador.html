<p>For details on the match, check reports from <a href="http://www.foxsportsworld.com">FoxSportsWorld</a> or <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/index?ver=us&amp;cc=5901">SoccerNet</a>, or the <a href="http://www.ussoccer.com/">US Men's site</a>. My commentary is an email I sent to FoxSportsWorld's MLS Wrap, since they broadcast the match and John Harkes is the host of that show:</p>
<p>Guys,</p>
<p>I was really disappointed with John Harkes commentary on the match. Great that we won, and points for calling out the pitiful referee (this guy has to get a lesson from CONCACAF!), but the homerism was unnecessary and not even useful. The US players started out great, until a minute or two after the first goal, then sat back with sloppy and lazy play most of the rest of the way.</p>
<p>Such an effort will do against El Salvador, Panama and Jamaica but will really hurt us in the final qualifying round and fir sure in Germany. You think teams like Czech Republic, Korea, Turkey, Argentina will be so kind as to get silly send-offs and expend zero energy on offense against us?</p>
<p>From just after the red card until Donovan's goal, the team had almost 100% possession but barely a single decent shot on frame. How is that good play? Better to be honest, fans can see for themselves what's happening. Be critical, these are professionals, and such honesty would be a breath of fresh air in American soccer television, that's for sure.</p>
<p>The late comments on how Clint Mathis and his Row Z first touch shots were "opening up opportunities" for us are, at the least, confusing to me. Once or twice, perhaps, would make some space in the back but if a player keeps doing it then there never is such an opportunity. If anything, he wasted most of our late chances for a third goal which, as you pointed out, might be very relevant in the final accounting.</p>
<p>John, if you want to be a homer and use your words to support the team, make sure Bruce gets this kind of message. Be honest with him, I'm sure you get the opportunities.<br /></p>
