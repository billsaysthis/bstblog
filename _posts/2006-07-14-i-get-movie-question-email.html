<p>Cliff asks:</p>
<p>Any word on three sequels:
<ol>
<li>Van Helsing. This movie made (I think) around 160-175 million at the box office and a lot more in DVD's. Heck,thats more than the recent Mission Impossible III flick made by 30-40 million bucks! Has there been any mention of a sequel?</li>
<li>X Files Movie. Again, made decent money on the first film and have heard rumors over the years of a sequel.</li>
<li>And of course, Raiders of the Lost Arc. What is the holdup on making a 4th movie of this blockbuster series?</li>
</ol>
<p>My answers:</p>
<p>I wish I had the definitive answers for you but here's my best understanding:
<ol>
<li>Not going to happen, though of course in Hollywood if the right two people get it in their head then any movie can be made. But <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0413168/">Hugh Jackman</a> is probably happy elsewhere and Steven Sommers, though quiet lately, has four unrelated projects <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0814085/">listed for the next couple of years in IMDB</a>.</li>
<li>There are stories from some of the principals, including Frank Spotnitz and Ducovny, that this will happen but there's still no approved script or production plans.</li>
<li>Similar status though maybe closer to production--one or another of the key players have rejected scripts written by very successful writers including Frank Darabont. IMDB lists it as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367882/">a 2008 release</a> but I'm sure that's no more than a guesstimate and they don't give a specific day or month, just the year. OTOH if they wait too much longer Ford will need to do it from a wheelchair ;)</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Bonus info:</span> Cinematical pointed me to <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/touchstone/theprestige/hd/">the stunning trailer</a> for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/">The Prestige</a>, a movie coming this fall starring Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine and witten and directed by Christopher Nolan (<a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/movies/2005/06/batman-begins">Batman Begins</a>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Memento</span>, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/movies/2002/05/insomnia">Insomnia</a>).</p>
