<p>Though not power so much as ability to cause gales (or at least a single gale) of laughter. Some anonymous doof posted to <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/main?cmd=threadview&amp;id=139729">Google Question</a> a request for sleazy information on Princeton economics professor/NY Times columnist Paul Krugman. So, in <a href="http://www.wws.princeton.edu/~pkrugman/strangelove.html">Your Questions Answered</a>, Krugman decided to pick up the $100 offered himself.</p>
<p>More seriously, Google is facing a lawsuit from a sleazy company called SearchKing over changes to SearchKing's PageRank. Which is what SearchKing sells, so bad for them. LawMeme analyzes as <a href="http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=807">Google replies</a> to SearchKing's filings.</p>
