<p>Usually when a price is not revealed, the amount is higher than one expects. Not so surprising with jewelry or other fancies but when the cost of joining the Y is teased and teased on <a href="http://www.ymcamidpen.org/textpage.php?b=4&amp;p=membership">the website</a>, when plenty of other costs are posted, when all the types of memberships are posted, you have to wonder what is going on. I got a postcard in the mail today (yes a snail mail paper postcard) with the tagline "Added Up, No One Beats Our Value!" and thought, well maybe I ought to look into this. The I searched the website, read <a href="http://www.ymcamidpen.org/faqs.php?b=4#faq9">the FAQ</a>, and all I could find was "Contact the El Camino YMCA's director of member services for information about joining the Y today!" Yeah I'm lazy enough to need to join a Y, or some gym, but that just makes me jump up and run over.</p>
