<p>Okay, I'm only 41. Many more years to go. But there are times when my memory just plays tricks on me. Twice recently (xXx and Pulp) I was writing my movie reviews and referred to previous movies by one of the actors or directors and looked up my review for the movie to include as a link. But in all cases, even though I remember writing the reviews, I can't find any trace of them on my site. Not in the Movie Review Index, not in the site search utility, not in the database of the movie reviews, not even in the Blogger database of weblog entries (accessible only to me in the authoring page). Strange. Very strange!</p>
