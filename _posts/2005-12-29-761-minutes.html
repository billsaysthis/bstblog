<p>Well, all sports streaks eventually end and the Reds' EPL shutout streak is no exception. Congratulations to Pepe Reina, Jamie Carragher, Sammy Hyppia and the changing assortment of fullbacks and holding midfielders who kept the ball out of our net for nearly 12 1/2 hours of English football. Despite allowing crosstown rivals Everton to score in the 42nd minute of today's match, Liverpool did continue the more important streak and won for the ninth straight time, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=185157&amp;cc=5901">3-1</a>, on goals from Peter Crouch (check out this <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/photo_galleries/4565054.stm">great photo of Crouch</a> taking keeper Nigel Martyn completely out of his shoes to score), Stevie G and Djibrille Cisse (who did get the start I was hoping for).</p>
