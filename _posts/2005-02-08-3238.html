<p>Here's a good photo of <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/images/misc/viv_bill_dancing_fenwickparty_0205.jpg">Vivian and me dancing</a> last Saturday night at her firm's holiday party at the Ritz-Carlton in Half Moon Bay. A really great party, beautiful location, great food, really good band (Motown, '70s soft rock and disco) and a chance for me to finally socialize with her co-workers.<br /></p>
