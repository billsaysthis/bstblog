<p>How is it that a major record label thinks that a crap band like Counting Crows is ready for a <a href="http://www.billboard.com/bb/daily/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=2014657">Greatest Hits package</a> after only four records? The labels blame web downloads for the plunging sales but I say they ought to look in the mirror and blames the execs who make stupid decisions such as this.</p>
