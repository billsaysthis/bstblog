<p>OMG, The Onion is just so fucking funny! Did I say fucking? Oh well. It is. Check <a href="http://www.theonion.com/onion3803/judge_orders_god.html">the story</a> out. One of many examples:</p>
<p style="font-size:80%;">The suit, brought against God by the Justice Department on behalf of a coalition of "lesser deities" and polytheistic mortals, alleged that He violated antitrust laws by claiming in the Holy Bible that He was the sole creator of the universe, and by strictly prohibiting the worship of what He termed "false idols."</p>
<p>There's even a cool USA Today-style infographic! The Whumpman <a href="http://www.whump.com/moreLikeThis/link/02598">gets in early</a> on this sure <a href="http://www.daypop.com/search?q=link%3Awww.theonion.com/onion3803/judge_orders_god.html&amp;t=w&amp;max=672" title="Not sure why but this entry is second in the list of citations at the moment I added this update">Daypop classic</a>.</p>
