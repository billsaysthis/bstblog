<p>Robert Kuttner suggests a <a href="http://www.prospect.org/print/V15/2/kuttner-r.html">dark vision for America</a> should Bush win re-election this November: America as a One-Party State [<em>via <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2004/01/23#demicracy">Doc</a> via Micah Sifry's <a href="http://www.iraqwarreader.com/archives/000119.html">One Party, uber alles</a></em>]. So many aspects of American--if not global--society has moved to the edges in recent years, we should hardly be surprised if politics does as well. Tattoos, reality shows, WWE, the ultra-violence of top video games, Enron and WorldCom, mutual fund abuses, Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore, they're all of a kind. Too bad they're not of the good kind.</p>
