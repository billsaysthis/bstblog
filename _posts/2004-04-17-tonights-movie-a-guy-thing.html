<p>If you take nothing else away from this movie, you will know without a doubt that Julia Stiles at 21 was gorgeous and will only get more so over the next two decades. She just has one of those faces that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0304415/Ss/0304415/MLS-202-DF-3807.jpg?path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Stiles,%20Julia">starts out from beautiful</a> and winds up over the border into some uncharted territory. But enough drooling.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mgm.com/aguything/">A Guy Thing</a>, released in 2003, is filled with cliches, sexual innuendo and shopworn gags, telling the story of the last few days before the wedding of Paul and Karen (Jason Lee and Selma Blair) in a very modern romantic comedy. At his bachelor party, Paul gets drunk and hooks up with Becky (played by Stiles)--but not really, of course, since they're both too drunk for anything to happen though they do spend the night together. Leading to all those tired, trite Hollywood components just mentioned.</p>
<p>Yet <em>Guy Thing</em> isn't just another waste of celluloid. It's funny, occasionally even witty, has characters who rise beyond stock and cast chemistry that engages. Props to director Chris Koch, who clearly is better than the material he had in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0184907/" title="yeah, that pathetic Chevy Chase movie">Snow Day</a>, his first feature directing assignment. And Lee is more than just a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118842/">vessel</a> for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120655/">Kevin</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0261392/">Smith</a>.</p>
<p><em>recommended</em></p>
