<p>What are blogs for if not to write about people or companies who've done an outstanding job? LOL, I know to, to tell when they haven't. Seriously, though, <a href="http://www.mvo.com/doctors.asp?ID=5">Dr. Ken Schwaderer</a> of Mountain View Optometry has been taking care of my vision for nine years now, since I've lived in Mountain View, and while I chose him out of convenience he has been a terrific choice. If you live in the are and need a doctor, I recommend him.</p>
<p>Bill, you say, why should I trust my eyes to Dr. Schwaderer? For most of the years I didn't have any special reason one way or the other. Then when I had <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_03_10_blog_archive.phtml#75010282">my checkup four years ago</a> he had a new machine that creates a digital image of the retinal surface of the eye, which are stored as part of your permanent medical file for future comparison, andenhances a doctor's ability to detect eye disease conditions. When my mother was diagnosed with macular degeneration a couple of years later I was more than happy that MVO was one of the Optomap early adopters.</p>
<p>My appreciation for Dr. Schwaderer's care and skill really came in the last 18 months as I've made yet another attempt to wear contact lenses. Due to allergies he had to try several different lenses and cleaning solutions before settling on B&amp;L Pure Vision. We're talking ten office visits, give or take, four or five trial pairs and two or three solution samples. I know, the vendors supply the samples at no cost but not only did he include all these visits in his base fee, he actually cut his fee when we realized how expensive the whole package was going to be.</p>
<p>This year I started having allergic reactions again, back in early July, and this started another round of visits. I'm wearing yet another type of lens and using a different cleaning solution, and no more leaving them in for a week at a time either, but there's been no charge beyond the annual checkup--would have done that anyway--even with two more trial pairs and new solution samples.</p>
<p>Formal qualifications? He's <a href="http://www.mvo.com/doctors.asp?ID=5">got them by the ton</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks Doc!</p>
