<p>My father and I were discussing a <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/myiddish.html">Straight Dope article on Yiddish</a> and had the following conversation via email, one line per email. I think this helps explain my sense of humor (D are my Dad's lines, B are mine):</p>
<p>D: Very scholarly and essentially correct.</p>
<p>B: Essentially? What mistakes does it make?</p>
<p>D: None that I could see.  It's just a way of phrasing it.</p>
<p>B: Ah, such lovely precise language!</p>
<p>D: Precise is for pedagogues.</p>
<p>B: Also for communicating clearly and accurately. And that would be precision, not precise!</p>
<p>D: Don't be so picky!</p>
<p>B: Why?</p>
<p>D: Why not?</p>
<p>B: Precision is useful because it conveys the information accurately.</p>
<p>D: As long as it isn't overemphasized or obsessed upon.</p>
<p>B: I don't think that one mention is too much.</p>
<p>D: I forgot what we were originally discussing.</p>
<p>B: Your comment on the Yiddish article.</p>
<p>D: Yes, but I forget what it was.</p>
<p>B: You suggested the article was (and I'm paraphrasing here) less than completely correct. When I asked what specifically was wrong, you replied that there really wasn't anything wrong with it.</p>
<p>D: I didn't say it was in any way incorrect.  I said it was essentially correct, which means that there's nothing wrong with it.</p>
<p>B: No, your phrase implies that there is something not quite right with the article.</p>
<p>D: I know what I meant, which,  unless you have hitherto undisclosed ESP, you couldn't possibly have.</p>
<p>B: You may have meant what you are thinking, I am not disputing that, but the words you used convey a commonly-accepted meaning. So again, your response was imprecise.</p>
<p>D: I am in total disagreement with your interpretation, which is, after all, only your opinion.</p>
<p>B: I see that even at your supposedly mature age, you still can't admit to minor errors. Oh well.</p>
<p>D: <strong>I</strong> can't?</p>
<p>B: Apparently not. So sad...</p>
<p>D: It's amazing how mistaken one son can be!</p>
<p>B: Yes but not in this instance.</p>
<p>D: That's another example of how mistaken you can be!  It's sad.</p>
<p>B: Sad is one way of characterizing it. Mistaken, though, is terribly wrong.</p>
<p>D: You keep persisting with the same error.  I'm so disappointed!</p>
<p>B: And who is responsible for your feelings? You are, so don't go putting them off on me.</p>
<p>D: Don't put that on me, buddy!  At almost 41 years old, you're entirely responsible for yourself.</p>
<p>B: You misunderstood me, as usual. I am saying you are responsible for your own emotions! Such as being sad.</p>
<p>D: Well, of course, but you need to express yourself much more clearly.</p>
<p>B: Hmm, I believe this is where we came in.</p>
<p>This was 34 emails for those of you still reading. 34!</p>
