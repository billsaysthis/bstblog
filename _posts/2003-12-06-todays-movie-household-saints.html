<p>It was day like many other days, and then I popped <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107152/">Household Saints</a> on from the TiVo playlist. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001700/" title="Yes, I know you can clink IMDB links as easily as me!">Nancy Savoca</a> starts from a novel by Francine Prose but falls into the "throw strange characters into a bowl" fallacy early on, and from there even decent acting jobs by Tracy Ullman, Vincent D'Onofrio and Lilli Taylor can't really pull it back over the hedge.</p>
<p>We follow Ullman and D'Onofrio through about 20 years of their lives, about 1949-1970ish, from when they came together because he won her (from her Dad) in a game of Pinochle, their early marriage living with his wacky old country Italian Mom and a stillborn baby, through the desperate childhood and strange death of a second, Jesus-obsessed daughter (Taylor). Though the novel probably spends the necessary verbiage establishing these characters and their reasons, the film never has the time and so I never did understand. D'Onofrio "just loves" Ullman, for instance, and can do no better when his mother asks for such help. Minor props to <em>The Sopranos'</em> Michael Imperioli for an amusing portrait of an ambitious young lawyer.</p>
<p><em>Barely recommended</em></p>
