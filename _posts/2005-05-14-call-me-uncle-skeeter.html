<p><a href="http://jenett.org/jenett/002473.shtml">Joe</a>, I sure do feel lucky. We got the phone call about two and a half hours ago that my nephew Jacob Michael Rentz was born at 4:45 this afternoon, a healthy six pounds nine ounces and 20 inches long, and he and my sister Joanne are resting comfortably. Despite the ultra-connectivity we think we're living in, no photos have yet been emailed to me but I expect to post one ASAP. Larry, do you hear me? LOL.</p>
<p>Coincidence: Tonight the final episodes of <span style="font-style:italic;">Star Trek: Enterprise</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Andromeda</span> were broadcast. I think this is more significant for my nephew's future than the date being Friday the 13th.</p>
<p>Jake, down the line when you ask about today, here's what I want to say: You are a fortunate child, born to two wonderful parents with four older siblings that will surely help you, tease you, tickle you and love you. Grandparents who've been waiting for your arrival as long as I can recall who want nothing more than to spoil you, within reason, as any grandparent should. And your Aunt Vivian and I, we may not be physically close but you're always going to be in our thoughts and hearts. Welcome to your new home. Live long and prosper.</p>
