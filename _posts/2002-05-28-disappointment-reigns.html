<p>That's the story after searching through NBA.com for historical information and not finding it. Specifically we were looking for a listing of previous champions and not only was there no accessible list, I couldn't find anything about previous seasons there. ESPN has the last two seasons but no overall data. Yahoo! Sports came up snakeyes. The Sporting News website won't even come up for me. Oddly, even using some reasonable <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=nba+statistics+%2Bchampionships&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=">search</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=nba%20league%20championships%20by%20team">terms</a> I couldn't find the info via Google. <em>Suckage!</em></p>
