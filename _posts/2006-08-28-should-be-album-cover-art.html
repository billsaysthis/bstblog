<p>My friend Guy took this terrific shot of his SO, he called it "Lilach and white", and I think its an awesome shot. I finally met Lilach last week at the end of their visit to California. She's a terrific, lovely woman--but no better than Guy deserves--and a big radio star in Israel.</p>
<p>My first thought was that the photo would make a great album cover, just some subtle typography in white at the lower right corner. Neat!</p>
