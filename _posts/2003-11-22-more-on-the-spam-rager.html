<p>The Mercury News <a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/business/7326032.htm" title="Likely to be behind a fee-only wall after 11/29/03">ran an article</a> today, written locally and not just a wire service reprint, that I just had to respond to. Here's my Letter to the Editor, we'll see if it gets printed:</p>
<p>I'm really surprised at the portrayal of Charles Booher in your article "Spam sends local man into rage." This front page article quotes his alleged victim, Doug Mackay, as if Mackay was an innocent rather than a lying perpetrator (as this article works hard to avoid saying) of work that enrages so many Americans. In fact it enrages us to the extent that, as reported and editorialized elsewhere in today's edition, that laws are being passed against these messages.</p>
<p>While Booher did clearly lose his temper and needed a good talking to, the idea that he should be facing five years in prison and a huge fine for a few blowing off the steam emails is beyond absurd; only if there was evidence that Booher was planning to travel the three thousand miles or so to confront Mackay in person could justify an arrest. Some comment from the US Attorney's office explaining their reasoning would really have been useful but the article lacks even a reported no comment.</p>
<p>This act by our government is, in the final analysis, a truly sad use of prosecutorial powers. I only hope that wiser heads prevail in the near future and these pointless charges are dismissed.</p>
