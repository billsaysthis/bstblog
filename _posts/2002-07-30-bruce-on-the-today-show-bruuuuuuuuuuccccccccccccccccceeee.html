<p><a href="http://www.nilslofgren.com">Nils</a> is playing the slide guitar parts. Bruce is playing the leads. Soozy Tyrell is now an official member of the E Street Band, bringing the total to 10, and I wonder if by the next tour he'll be bringing back the Monopoly players from the days of the Bruce Springsteen Band. Amazing how much the crowd is into this, they already know the words to sing along to <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_06_23_blog_archive.phtml#85197466">The Rising</a>. Glory Days is the surprise older tune he threw into the set; he brought out the battered Telecaster for it and Steve has the mandolin.</p>
<p>Listening to the Big Man's sax layering on top of the guitars, reaching higher, higher, higer, it just sends chills down my spine. In the interview before he started playing, Bruce said that he saw his role as testifying anf getting people up to dance. He means testifying in a religious sense and I get it, all the way, especially when he's throwing his hand up during the "It's all right" choruses on <a href="http://demand1.stream.aol.com/ramgen/aol/us/aolmusic/artists/sony/mozart/mozart_pianoconcerto_web.rm">Lonesome Day</a>.</p>
<p>The fourth song is <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_07_14_blog_archive.phtml#85251959">Into the Fire</a> and Bruce really has his mountain voice on. Hard to listen to this song, seeing the crowd, and the band, and not feel the tears slipping down from my eyes. This song is the power of rock and roll, the depth of the lyrics, the connection to who we are, who we can be, and still get up and dance.</p>
<p>"No Better Colors: Red, White, and Bruce" read one of the signs held up and surely that can't be argued with.</p>
