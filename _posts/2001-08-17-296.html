<p><b>I am not..a leper!</b><br />

<p><a href="http://www.xrefer.com">xreferer</a> is an interesting new reference site that allows users to search over 50 reference titles containing more than 500,000 entries. Looking up <a href="http://www.xrefer.com/results.jsp?shelf=search+all&amp;term=lazar">'lazar'</a>, I foundthat there are several eastern European artistic types with my last name and also a <a href="http://www.xrefer.com/entry.jsp?xrefid=567772&amp;secid=.-">biblical reference</a>--apparently it was used as a generic name for lepers in the Middle Ages but means, in Aramaic, God is my help.</p>
