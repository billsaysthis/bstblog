<p>Have you seen the commercials on TV or heard them on radio? Are you annoyed too? Well, I did a little Googling and here are some of the English language results. One version is a <a href="http://tal.stat.umu.se/~gb/MLife/">statistical computer program</a> "for survival analysis with emphasis on Cox regression with various extensions, such as allowing easy introduction of communal (external) covariates, etc, etc." Another is a <a href="http://www.tfaoi.com/newsmu/nmus61a.htm">set of paintings</a> by Charles Burchfield. A third is from eServ Global, a <a href="http://www.eservglobal.com/services_solutions/solutions/mobil_internet.html">solution family</a> for the mobile telecommunications provider and Internet markets. Not to be left out is the <a href="http://www.mlife.org/">Meaning of Life</a>, which seems to be about believing in God and perfecting man through that belief. Or is <a href="http://www.motivateus.com/stories/mlife.htm">this</a> the meaning of life? Anyway, none of these seem to be the one behind the annoying commercials.</p>
