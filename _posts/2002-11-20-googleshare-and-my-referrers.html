<p>My site seems to average about 175 hits a day. Which is fine, though not in the <a href="http://dangerousmeta.com">garret</a> or <a href="http://denbeste.nu">Steve</a> range, but almost all of the hits come from search engines rather than links from other sites. (I do certainly appreciate the links from friends.) Lately, an amusingly large percentage of the hits have come from terms similar to '2003 movies'.</p>
<p>In the course of spelunking tonight, I hit <a href="http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/">stevenberlinjohnson.com</a>. Steven is the author of the very hot, very now book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0684868768/" title="His Amazon link, not mine">Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software</a>. He <a href="http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/movabletype/archives/000011.html">wrote about a concept</a>, which was quickly given the name Googleshare, which uses the Google web services API to calculate the percentage of hits a second search term has within a bigger set. For example, Johnson gives the following numbers:</p>
<p>Emergence: 1,450,000 hits<br />
<br />Emergence with SBJ: 5190<br />
<br />Mindshare: .3%</p>
<p>So a couple of bright fellows quickly whipped up implementations of the idea. <a href="http://ed.suppose.co.uk/googleshare.php">One</a> of them, by <a href="http://ed.suppose.co.uk/">edward george</a>, is publicly available (that is, you don't need to supply your own Google API key) so I took a shot to see what my Googleshare was with "2003 movies" and the result was quite surprising: 'billsaysthis' has a 10.6% googleshare of '"2003 movies".' And that goes a long way to explaining the volume of hits.</p>
