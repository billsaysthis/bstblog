<p>The NY Times had an article recently on the Product Red campaign and how big corporations are increasingly donating to charities like it. In the article, IIRC, a cynic pointed out that for every donated dollar these companies spend four or five publicizing their good deed.</p>
<p>Watching the Oscars tonight (congrats to Joel and Ethan Coen for their three big wins) I think Coke fell into this same dark alley. They ran a short ad during just about every single commercial break--for over three hours!--announcing a new women's health initiative sponsored by Diet Coke. Plus a chance to win a red dress worn by Heidi Klum!</p>
<p>Running the spot once every 45 or 60 minutes would probably have fallen within the bounds of good taste but this was just sad. As the show wore on I found myself thinking again and again that Coca Cola would do a hell of a lot more good for women (and men) if they'd just stop selling regular Coke, not exactly the reaction their marketing execs were looking to get.</p>
<p>Seriously, how much damage do their 'regular' beverages cause? How can donating a few dollars to a good cause outweigh that?</p>
