<p>The lack of new posts to the weblog here over the past two days is not intentional nor do I have pneumonia (<a href="http://www.glennf.com/gmblog/">sorry Glenn</a>). Blogger has simply refused to transfer my generated files from its servers to my web server. Then gives up with a generic Transfer Error. I've filed a trouble ticket and emailed TPTB, hopefully we'll get a fix soon. I'm jonesing to update already!</p>
