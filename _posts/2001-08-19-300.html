<p><b>Inside Scientology</b><br />

<p>L. Ron Hubbard was a mediocre science fiction writer back (he wrote the novel on which last year's bomb <a href="http://www.battlefieldearth.com">Battlefield Earth</a> is based) in the '50s when he realized that he could wrap his SF concepts into a nearly coherent hole and start a lucrative new religion. Somehow it worked. Hubbard is long gone but the folks running the <a href="http://www.scientology.org/home.html">Church Of Scientology</a> are still pulling in the dough. <a href="http://www.xenu.net/index.html">Operation Clambake</a> is a major effort by Andreas Heldal-Lund to make plain the problems with this so-called Church. Be careful if you <a href="http://www.religiousfreedomwatch.org/extremists/" title="The linked site is run by the Church">cross them</a>!</p>
