<p><strong>Tonight's TV: The Prisoner</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever watched this <a href="http://www.netreach.net/~sixofone/">short British series</a> from the '60s? Only 17 episodes but still widely loved today. Patrick McGoohan stars as Number 6, a man who was once a top secret agent but handed in his resignation only to be drugged and transported to The Village. This is a mysterious place where each episode features McGoohan trying to find out where he is, how he came to be there, or how to get out and each week there is a new local boss or Number 2.</p>
<p>One of the local public TV stations is currently running the show on Sunday nights and tonight broadcast <em>Many Happy Returns</em>. In this episode, McGoohan awakes to find The Village empty, the water and electric turned off. After exploring and taking some snapshots (with a camera borrowed from the store), he makes a primitive boat and sets sail. After 25 days at sea, he has a run in with a boat but ends up ashore in England. Returning to London, he meets a kindly old woman who has taken posession of his flat and sports car and confronts his former employers with his photos. They finally believe him and provide a jet to search for The Village. Finding it, the pilot ejects McGoohan, who returns to his Village home to find the kind old woman is actually this week's Number 2.</p>
<p>The preceeding paragraph seems simple and straightforward but it in no way captures the psychedelic nature of the show. From the color schemes, clothing, furnishings to the pseudo-druggy behavior of the supporting players. Let me say that I've never taken LSD or mushrooms but when watching The Prisoner often feel I have an inkling of what that would be like.</p>
<p>Kipp Teague has a <a href="http://www.retroweb.com/prisoner.html">wonderful site</a> dedicated to the show with plenty of detail and photographs. There is also a considerable fan club, <a href="http://www.netreach.net/~sixofone/">Six of One</a>. Allegedly Simon West (director of Tomb Raider) is preparing a new major motion picture version, but there have been efforts to do this in the past which never came to fruition.</p>
