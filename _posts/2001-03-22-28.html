<p><b>Non-competes more applicable in high tech</b>
<p>High tech companies have become much more aggressive in preventing employees from moving to the competition (including when the competitor is a startup of which the departing employee is a co-founder) and the courts are giving them an edge: <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1007-201-5209901-0.html?tag=bt_pr">Companies crack down on loose lips</a>.</p>
<p>Note that courts are curtailing employees' rights to take new jobs even when they have not signed any type of non-compete clause or agreement, relying heavily on the theory of inevitable disclosure of trade secrets.</p>
