<p>I always remembered <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090180/">To Live and Die in L.A.</a>&nbsp;fondly even if I only saw it once in the theaters during its run in 1985 and on cable shortly after. A very slick movie that had ahead of its time visual editing and a purpose-built rock soundtrack. Not to mention writer/director <a href="http://williamfriedkin.com/wfbio.asp">William Friedkin's</a> sure touch with the relationship between cops and crooks.<br />
<br />&nbsp;<br />
<br />Tried to get&nbsp;the thing&nbsp;recorded by TiVo for the longest time but for some reason no luck; then Fry's had the DVD on deep discount and voila! A lazy Summer afternoon is a great time to&nbsp;watch this icy cool flick.<br />
<br />&nbsp;<br />
<br />The first starring roles for Willem Dafoe (the bad boy), William Peterson (the anti-hero) and John Pankow (badling before his time), the story turns on a murderous counterfieter faced off against two Secret Service agents. Peterson will go to any lengths to avenge his murdered partner (played by Michael Greene), even though his partner more or less brought his own death on by mysteriously refusing backup.<br />
<br />&nbsp;<br />
<br />Not too many big blowups or action sequences but the ones we get are really strong. Most spectacular, perhaps, is an amazing, very long car chase where Peterson and Pankow don't even know who's chasing them or why. And a lovely romantic interest for each of the leads, with matching personalities.<br />
<br />&nbsp;<br />
<br />The end is very surprising for Hollywood and I was not at all surprised to hear the director say, on his commentary track, that the studio ordered an alternate shot; watching what was proposed (an extra on the DVD)&nbsp;I'm more than happy he was able to stay with the original. Sadly, this was Freidkin's last decent flick, though not his last by far. Remember Samuel Jackson's rancid <em>Rules of Engagement</em> or Shaq in <em>Blue Chips</em>?<br />
