<p>What a frustrating match!!! Yes, any loss is a problem but tonight we went down because of better acting from Los Angeles, poor passing especially in the midfield, below normal goalkeeping and a job from the officials. Props to Carlos Ruiz for the two Galaxy goals, both were legitimate.</p>
<p>The Sweet One <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/vivroar/archives/2004_07_04_archive.html#108899650151959215">adds her perspective</a> on my viewing habits.</p>
<p>Landon had some sweet moves but in the end couldn't connect strongly enough with Derosario and Ching, though Dwayne did get the first goal of the match. Onstadt faced far too many chances, especially the first LA goal off a pointless corner in first half injury time; still, his clearances were poor most of the night.</p>
<p>Referee Kevin Stott was pitiful though one can't simply pin the loss on him in whole. But even at the very end he couldn't control the field and I hope the MLS gives this performance of his a very careful review. The second yellow, and attendent dismissal, to Brian Mullan was more than sad because the card resulted from a terrific acting job from Ruiz--there wan't even any contact though the Guatemalan international spent two minutes writhing in pain to cinch the deal.</p>
<p>Worse, it came just after Brian Ching was brought down in the box by Ryan Suarez and Stott let it go without so much as a nod. All told the ref gave at least six yellows to the Quake players, one at the end of the first half to Derosario that never got explained, while allowing far too many fouls by LA to go unmarked.</p>
<p>Better luck Wednesday night as they host the Dallas Burn, who also lost this weekend, at Spartan Stadium for Hawaiian Night. Next Saturday they travel to Jersey to meet the MetroStars but will be without Landon, Ching and Mullan who are heading to Chicago as part of the US squad for a Sunday friendly against Poland; MetroStars' midfielder Eddie Gaven and defender Eddie Pope will also play for the US.</p>
