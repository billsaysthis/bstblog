<div><a href="http://www.caterwauling.com/">Dawn</a> asked for a recipe involving balls of some type for her upcoming carnival. I haven't done much cooking lately, TS1 claims she gets too much pleasure from doing for me and I'm willing to believe her ;), but here's something veggie I do enjoy: Spaghetti and Mock Meatballs.</p>
<p>Get yourself some good quality straight pasta, preferably made without 'enriched' flour and chemicals, and cook per instructions and have some of your favorite marinara sauce on hand. You'll also need some garlic (one clove per eater) and whole brown or white mushrooms. You can make the meatballs from a recipe like <a href="http://www.ivu.org/hlsc/recipes/spanish-mock-meatballs.html">this one</a> from the Healthy Living Supper Club or buy a pack of Trader Joe's Meatless Meatballs. Get out a pan big enough to hold the meatballs and mushrooms. Here's the final prep:
<ul>
<li>slice the fresh mushrooms, thin or quartered as you prefer</li>
<li>mince garlic</li>
<li>warm three tablespoons of olive oil in your pan</li>
<li>add in garlic, sautee  for a couple of minutes until they're soft and translucent</li>
<li>add mushrooms and stir to coat, cook through for five minutes</li>
<li>add in sauce, stir for two minutes</li>
<li>add in meatballs to warm</li>
<li>toss in pasta, stir to coat and serve</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</div>
