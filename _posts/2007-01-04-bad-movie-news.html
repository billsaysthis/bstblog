<p>Wired Mag has a <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.01/play.html">brief look back</a> at the highlights of Luc Besson's directorial career in response to Besson's announcement that <a href="http://www.arthur-movie.com/">Arthur and the Invisibles</a> will be the last time he sits in the director's chair.</p>
<p>While its true that this big budget animation is based on the series of bestselling children's books Besson himself wrote, I'm truly disappointed that he won't bring his magic to one last action flick. Here are my almost uniformly positive writeups on two Besson-directed movies:Leon (aka The Professional) and The Fifth Element.</p>
<p>While I have't written a review, since I watched it many times prior to starting this blog, his 1990 movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100263/">La Femme Nikita</a> is one of my all time favorites. He nearly singlehandedly created the female ass-kicking heroine drama with it, all due ackowledgement to Sigourney Weaver and <i>Alien</i>. Good enough to be remade by Hollywood as <i>Point of No Return</i> with Bridget Fonda in the Anne Parillaud title role and then expanded into the made for syndication/cable TV series of the same name, LFN inspired many movies, video games and TV shows (think Alias, Buffy the Vampire Slayer or 24&mdash;from the creative team behind the LFN TV version&mdash; would have been made if not for this?).</p>
<p>So I really would love to see one more head-pounding, leg-breaking, big boom flick with Luc Besson in complete control.</p>
