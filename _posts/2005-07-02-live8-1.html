<p>We're watching the MTV broadcast of <a href="http://www.live8live.com/">LIVE 8 â€“ The Long Walk to Justice</a> and 24 minutes in we've heard exactly two songs, maybe six minutes max, of music. I don't really begrudge the commercials, the bills need to get paid and there are plenty of PSAs too, but all the VJ self-promoting blather is beyond annoying and the 10 second per tune <em>highlights</em> were useless. Okay, Black Eyed Peas with the Marleys are back on now with a Bob Marley classic. Hope this is not going to be the pattern all day, is all I will say.</p>
