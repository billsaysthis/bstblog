<p>Does it strike anyone else as odd that Jon Udell seems to <a href="http://del.icio.us/judell">tag all his articles to del.icio.us</a>? Is this going to be the next <a href="http://www.wordspy.com/words/egoboo.asp">egoboo</a>? I hope not. Jon's stuff is usually interesting but the next 10,000 people to have the same idea are less likely to achieve the same quality, and then there's the ticking time bomb of spammers.</p>
