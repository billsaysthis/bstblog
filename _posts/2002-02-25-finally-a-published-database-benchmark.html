<p>Most of the database vendors include a clause in their licenses which prohibit anyone from publishing results of a benchmark test without permission. Typically this has led to a paucity of independent, verifiable published test results. So when I saw Timothy Dyck's article <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article/0,3658,s=708&amp;a=23115,00.asp">Server Databases Clash</a> in eWeek today I was pleased and yet quite surprised. Then again his results showed Oracle coming out on top and while that company is usually the toughest in prohibiting publication perhaps these results made a difference in their attitude. I wrote to ask him about this and if and when I get an answer will post it.</p>
