<p>Our thoughts are with AnitaR <a href="http://www.anitarowland.com/gmarchives/00001429.html">as she recovers</a> from a hysterectomy forced by ovarian cancer--the strong survive and though I've only known her through her writings, the feeling here is that Anita is more than strong enough to beat this. Go Girl! Remember the power of laughter!</p>
