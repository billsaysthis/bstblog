<p><a href="http://www.starpie.com/forum/index.php">Star Pie Movie Forum</a> has added me to the list of friends on the front page of their forum for <a href="http://www.rawsugar.com/collections/billsreviews">my reviews</a>. Very nice of them and good luck in their plan to build a site with reviews for all movies and TV shows. An ambitious goal but possible though I think a more realistic plan would be to make a RawSugar collection of all the other movie review sites.</p>
<p>On a similar note I belatedly added <a href="http://www.broomeman.com/">Danny Broomeman</a> to the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/misc/blogroll.php">blogroll</a>. He's sent me as much traffic as any personal site except dangerousmeta over the years and I'm remiss for not returning the favor.</p>
