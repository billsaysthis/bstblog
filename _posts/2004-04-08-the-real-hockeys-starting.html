<p>I haven't followed hockey enough to make predictions for the playoffs this year. Of course I'm rooting for a Finals matchup of the Sharks and the Devils and, for a change, I think this is not completely out of the question. Of course <a href="http://www.sportsfilter.com/lockerroom/comments.cfm/486">some of the SpoFites</a> are picking both teams to be upset in the first round, so no certain thing either but room to hope.</p>
<p>I'm watching the second half of the Detroit-Nashville opener and seeing why the Red Wings won this season's President's Trophy. When I turned the game on, about halfway through the second period, Nashville was up 1-0 and looking strong. But Detroit was dominant during an end of period Nashville power play and then in the first minutes of the third scored two goals to take the lead; they just have such depth and power that they can never be counted out. Sharks against Red Wings in the Western Finals would be a great matchup too.</p>
<p><em>A Few Minutes Later...</em> Robert Lang gave the Wings a third goal a few minutes from the end and it was a beauty, a breakaway with only one defender on him in front of Nashville's Voukun. No matter that the defender and Lang were falling down tangled in each other, Lang poked and prodded as he was sliding and twisted Voukun out of position and put the puck where it wanted to go. These guys are going to be tough to knock out.</p>
