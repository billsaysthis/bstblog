<p><a href="http://www.pamslife.com/">Pam</a> invited us to go see this film and, since we wanted to see it anyway, said sure. Always good to spend time with the lady with the <a href="http://www.pamslife.com/New%20Hat.JPG">funny hat</a> even if she wouldn't wear it to the movie house, plus we had some pretty tasty BBQ after.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.collateral-themovie.com/home.php">Collateral</a> comes from director Michael Mann (<em>Miami Vice</em>, <em>Heat</em>, <em>Ali</em>) and scripwriter Stuart Beattie (first big American credit) that rides a fairly standard Hollywood formula but turns many of these aspects against itself to succeed:<br />

<ul>
<li>Hit man hires a cabbie to drive him around one night while he takes out the witnesses planning to testify against a drug lord </li>
<li>Weak hero (Jamie Fox) starts out scared of his own shadow but overcomes it through events and provocation, but mostly because of true--not needed by the script--goodness in his heart</li>
<li>Tom Cruise cast against type as the bad guy, with gray hair and a scraggly beard, which only matters because Cruise has such a positive, pretty boy reputation and he confounds expectations in ways that less strongly-typed actors couldn't</li>
<li>A slick, stylish production, visually, sonically, even in the editing that will be no surprise to Mann fans</li>
</ul>
<p>Pam said this was the best movie she's seen this year and I'll agree with her that this is excellent but I'd rank it second to, but not far behind, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_07_25_blog_archive.phtml#109080336891782926">Bourne Supremacy</a>.</p>
<p><em>definitely recommended</em><br /></p>
