<p>I hate getting weird programming errors and while setting up the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/misc/other.phtml">Etc... page</a> I had a reason for the first time in a while to look at the page for my aborted story, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_08_18_blog_archive.phtml#85367875">The Fear</a>. Instead of working as expected I got a page saying</p>
<p><em>Fatal error: Cannot redeclare xmlrpc_decode() in /home/blazar/www/utils/bxmlrpc.php on line 1004</em></p>
<p>I've checked through to the extent of my expertise, looked through the PHP newsgroup, refreshed my copy of the relevant files, searched through the PHP docs, even checked with a friend at Google in case the error was on their side since my page is using their API to pull the entries out of the blog database, but nothing makes any difference. I even grepped all my source just in case I was somehow using the same function name in two places but that was no help either. What a bummer!<br /></p>
