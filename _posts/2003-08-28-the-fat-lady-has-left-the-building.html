<p>Well, actually, I've listed <a href="http://cgi6.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewSellersOtherItems&amp;include=0&amp;userid=billsaysthis&amp;sort=3&amp;rows=25&amp;since=-1&amp;rd=1">my first 18 items</a> for auction on eBay. Perhaps the big new text on the top of left hand navigation box is a good enough clue for most of you but I'm not at all about the subtlety, not even close. Tell them what you're going to tell them, tell them, then remind them what you just told them, that's my motto. For today. Sell, baby, sell.</p>
