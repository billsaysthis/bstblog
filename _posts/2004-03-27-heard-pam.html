<p><a href="http://www.pamslife.com/">Pam</a> made some sweet music tonight at the <a href="http://www.harmonybakery.com">Harmony Bakery</a> in Palo Alto and TS1 and I were there to enjoy most of it. She sang and played piano, accompanied by her friend Tim on acoustic guitar. Most of the songs were unfamiliar to me except for her original composition, <em>400 Miles</em>, which is a beautiful song she wrote for her fiance Henry before they got engaged. They'll be playing again the last Friday of April at the same space, try and catch them.</p>
