<p>OH YEAH! NINERS! NINERS! NINERS! For once we were not on the losing end of a huge fourth quarter comeback. Garcia was the man, with Owens putting things over the top. Giants defensive back was also key to our victory with two consecutive incredibly stupid penalties at the end of the game. Finally, the the Giants could not keep things together for a simple field goal to win the game, second bad snap of the game for Trey Junkins. To make it all the sweeter, I got to call my Giants fan dad and taunt him afterwards.</p>
