<p><strong>AIDS Ride: too expensive?</strong></p>
<p>After eight years of partnering on the high profile California AIDS Ride bicycling fundraiser, a <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/news/archive/2001/12/18/state1257EST0042.DTL">AIDS Ride management dispute leads to lawsuit, competing event</a>. This is really sad to see but not too surprising. One of my friends has ridden the event the last four years and I've always given generously to support him. But I also felt that this was a very expensive way to raise money for a charity and not enough was going through to the beneficiaries. I hope the charities and organizers can resolve the dispute soon since the preparation takes so long but I have to come down on the side of spending less to run the Ride; perhaps the riders need to pay an entry fee to help defray the costs of sheltering and feeding.</p>
