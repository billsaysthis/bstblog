<p>Wow, huge upset in the first match of the 2004 European Championship! Hosts Portugal <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/euro2004/match?id=150273&amp;cc=5901">go down 2-1</a> to Greece, barely avoiding a clean sheet on an injury time goal by Manchester United's Christian Ronaldo. As Soccernet's anonymous Gamecast commentary pointed out, only one team has lost their opener and gone on to win the trophy.</p>
<p>Bummer that the tournament is on pay per view, I would love to watch the England-France match that begins shortly. FSW will be showing some of the other first round matches this week, though not this one, and I will grab them as I can.</p>
