<p>A friend asked a few weeks back how I'd do this. There are four good options (at least):
<ol>
<li>Download and install <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">Open Office</a>, which is a reasonably complete open source office suite that can read an write the corresponding Microsoft Office file formats. This is actually a Sun-led project but works well enough especially for your limited needs. Handy if you have other productivity tool needs (like PowerPoint, Excel, Access) too.</li>
<li>Use an already installed, compatible tool:
<ul>
<li>Many PCs come with either Microsoft Works (the word processing component can save files in Word format).</li>
<li>All Windows PCs since Windows 98 (I think) have WordPad, which saves files in Word-compatible RTF format. Look for it in Start Menu | Programs | Accessories.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Download and install <a href="http://www.cutepdf.com/">CutePDF</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eghost/">GhostView</a>, both freeware, which gives you the ability to 'print' to PDF format from any Windows app--everybody can read PDF files and they retain the formatting.</li>
<li>Send the non-Word version to a friend who has Word.</li>
</ol>
