<p><b>Today's book: Breaking Windows</b></p>
<p>After seeing lots of fuss over this book from various weblogs and <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/08/04/1524254">others</a>, I couldn't resist picking up this <a href="http://www.breakingwindows.net/">look inside Microsoft</a> by Wall Street Journal reporter David Bank. A very interesting read focusing on the years 1996-2000 as Bank had boxes full of Microsoft email and other internal documents thanks to the antitrust case and interviews with many key MS employees, including Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. Worth the read.</p>
<p>Dave Winer <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2001/08/13/excerptFromBreakingWindows">published an excerpt</a> online (with the publisher's permission).</p>
