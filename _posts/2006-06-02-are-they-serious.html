<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060601/ap_en_mu/music_british_album_vote_1">British vote Oasis album best of all</a> according to a poll by British music mag New Music Express. I can't find the entire list online but the top ten includes two Oasis releases, two from Radiohead and one each from The Smiths and a group never heard of in the US called The Stone Roses, plus two Beatles, one Nirvana and one Pink Floyd. I organized the ten into <span style="font-style:italic;">Are they serious?</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Decent choices</span>; can you tell which is which?</p>
<p>Really, no Bruce, U2, Stones, Kinks, Dylan, Beach Boys, or any black singer or group? While the remaining 90 spots do include U2's "The Joshua Tree" at 11, Michael Jackson's "Thriller" at 35, the Rolling Stones' "Exile on Main Street," at 42 and Springsteen's "Born to Run" at 84 I find it hard to take this poll seriously. One of these days I'll post my own (admittedly highly biased) Top 100 and then you'll see what quality really is.</p>
