<p>A quick laugher in the morning business section today. Coca-Cola's Fountain Division, which handles the company's interaction with restaurants and such, is exploring the possibility of launching a line of hot coffee to be sold as their sodas are today: as liquid concentrate with (hot) water added when the drink is served. OMG! Puh-lease! I'm not close to being a coffee snob but this would just be sad. Isn't it enough for Coke to dominate soda, water (Aquafina is their brand), and juices? If you see a brand of coffee called <i>Viaa Cafe</i> you'll know the execs have gone deep into the madness.</p>
