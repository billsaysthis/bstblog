<p>Met the might, mighty <a href="http://www.whump.com/moreLikeThis/index.php3">Whump</a> over at his <a href="http://www.apple.com">place of employ</a> today and we ate in their cafeteria. Let's just say I've eaten in the cafeterias at Sun and Amazon and Apple has them both beat. Maybe somebody at MS Mountain View should invite me there so I can write a roundup review; do any of the MS blogging army work in MTNVW?</p>
<p>How odd is it that both of us are named Bill, live in Mountain View but did not grow up here, wear glasses, program computers in PHP using MySQL, and have personal websites featuring weblogs? Pretty creepy, I think. Still, Whump does have a job (and from what I saw a cool one which he does well) and uses Macs, even before he started working there plus he wrote his own weblog software. More creepiness: we both had salads with grilled chicken for lunch! Do you hear the moaning of ghosts by now?</p>
<p>Other than socializing, the main purpose of my visit was to get some up close insight into his More Like This weblog software. It's written in PHP, uses MySQL, and the code is free for the asking, if one asks nicely. Supports Trackback, RSS, and categories (which of these three is <a href="http://new.blogger.com">not like</a> the other?), all must haves. But now he's got me thinking that I ought to do the really cool, jump in off the deep end thing and write my own system. Egads!</p>
<p>The other way you can tell us apart, just to show we're not the same guy, is that Whump is <em>thin</em> and I am just a wannabe!</p>
