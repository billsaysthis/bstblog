<p>Bob Lutz, <a href="http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/archives/2005/01/lutz_biography_1.html#more">vice chairman of General Motors</a> and a top auto exec known as being a <span style="font-style:italic;">car guy</span> rather than salesman or bean counter, takes to blogging like a natural in his first entry: <a href="http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/archives/2005/01/saturn_product_1.html">Saturn: Product Will Reign</a>. I wouldn't be terribly surprised to find out that his post had been at least polished or vetted by the marketing staff but regardless it is written in a very natural voice, emphatically positive without crossing over into fanboy/cheerleader land. I'm not a big car guy at all, though I like seeing new things (hence the Auto Show photos) but this ought to be an interesting blog to follow. More fodder for <a href="http://redcouch.typepad.com/weblog/">The Red Couch</a>.
