<p>So I suggest you read <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1383404,00.html">UN warns of AIDS tipping point in China, Russia and India</a> and recognize that though we here in the United States may seem mostly safe and protected, that is far from certain. Another scary thought in a scary world.</p>
