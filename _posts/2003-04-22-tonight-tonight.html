<p>Just for the heck of it, Evan and I are going to the <a href="http://www.baynetug.org">Bay.NET User Group</a> meeting tonight to hear Amanda Silver, Program Manager for Microsoft VB.NET, talk about the future of (what else?) VB.NET. Wonder if I can get a free copy from her. Or a job. That would be better, or at least more useful. <i>Buffy</i>'s a repeat anyway.</p>
