<p>Or perhaps most people never did trust them, but this eWeek article, <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article/0,3658,s=1884&amp;a=22859,00.asp">Shaving Milliseconds Per Hit Adds Up to Real Money</a>, doesn't even appear to be a rewrite of a company press release. Unless of course RouteScience has come up with such amazing new technology that not a single person will find even a scintilla of something worth criticizing.</p>
