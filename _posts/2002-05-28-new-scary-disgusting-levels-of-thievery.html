<p>What's particularly scary about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/28/national/28IDEN.html">Thieves Steal Homeowners' Identities and Their Equity</a> is that you don't know about the crime until after its happened, too late to do any good. I think. But if someone fraudulently sells or mortgages your house, how can you be held responsible? By responsible, in the case of a fraudulent sale, I mean wouldn't the transaction simply be reversed and title restored?</p>
<p>Short summary: a ring of identity thieves in Michigan went beyond just stealing people's social security numbers and such to set up fake credit cards or similar. They actually found elderly people who own homes free and clear and either took out big mortgages or sold the home (to another identity thief). An unusually cooperative team of police, FBI, prosecutors, and bankers uncovered the details, then arrested and charged the criminals.</p>
