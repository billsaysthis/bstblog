<p>[<em>Note:</em> First in an occasional series that will run whenever I feel like it]</p>
<p>Things are in the crapper at the Air Force Academy after all the problems uncovered with sexual assualt and harrassment of so many female cadets. Yet Sen. Larry Craig (Republican, what else?) of Idaho <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A49302-2003Jun12.html">thinks</a> some eight year old promise to house four freaking cargo planes at an airbase in his state is more important than the real needs of our nation's military today. What a jizzbot!</p>
