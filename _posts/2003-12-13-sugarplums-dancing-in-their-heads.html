<p>Twisting turning turvsy slipping<br />
<br />Action heroes carry tiny babies<br />
<br />Black curly hair flops over an arm<br />
<br />Wonderful tears dripping down her<br />
<br />Cheek while both mothers argue over<br />
<br />Who will cook the corn and coo at the child<br />
<br />Though mortars explode about 25 feet away.</p>
<p>On the other side of the screen naked<br />
<br />Tree branches sway back from the explosive<br />
<br />Force and a dozen black birds jump into the sky,<br />
<br />Startled by the off-center noise. The babies raised<br />
<br />Their heads up as one and gave the crows an evil eye.</p>
<p>No one says a word as a skinny woman with a<br />
<br />Black rifle creeps into the scene, pulling her arm<br />
<br />Then her a leg, the other arm, then the mothers<br />
<br />Gasped as they realized the gun was melted<br />
<br />On the arm and not held in it, slathered in thick<br />
<br />Red blood. No number of kisses under the mistletoe<br />
<br />Will erase the vision of that particular sugarplum.</p>
<p>"Fly me to the moon<br />
<br />Let me sing among those stars<br />
<br />Let me see what Spring is like<br />
<br />On Jupiter and Mars"</p>
<p>Don't twist don't shout don't turn away<br />
<br />Keep your head inside a camo-covered<br />
<br />Helmet and listen for more than Dragonflies<br />
<br />If you want to cash your next paycheck at home<br />
<br />More than you want to see the tears stream down<br />
<br />Your wife's cheeks, looking on from above. How many<br />
<br />kisses will it take to erase that sugarplum vision?</p>
<p>Watch where the deeper curves want to<br />
<br />Take the free radicals after listening to a holiday<br />
<br />Guest pass out spiritual gifts. The headaches will<br />
<br />Start when the whistle blows, when the babies scream<br />
<br />No matter what the soldiers do and even though<br />
<br />Resistance tends to bar amazement, even tears cannot<br />
<br />Tear apart the soft electric underbelly that seethes<br />
<br />Under the stag staged confetti grace.</p>
