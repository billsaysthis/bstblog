<p>Actions speak louder than words and seeing <a href="http://www.philringnalda.com/main/">Phil Ringnalda</a> migrate his weblog from Blogger to MoveableType is surely one that speaks loudly. Phil has been the main source of tech support for Blogger users for the past year out of the goodness of his own heart (that is, he volunteered and didn't even get so much as a link from Blogger head Evan Williams' own site), he's written scripts that make a variety of archive formats simple, and he's never taken enough credit for his work. Phil stepped in because Evan didn't have the time to do it, we know he's work hard to keep things working and moving to the next level, but one thinks that there had to be someway to keep Phil happy and in the camp.</p>
