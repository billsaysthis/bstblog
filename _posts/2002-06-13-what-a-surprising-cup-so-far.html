<p>Just in case you're looking for a full time WC blog, check out <a href="http://www.worldcupblog.org/">World Cup Blog</a> to Follow the Action, the boys there are doing a fine job. I myself am essentially amazed that France is going home having scored no goals after being THE number one favorite to win the whole thing and that the Argentines are off as well after netting only two balls. Will Portugal join them on the sidelines? What about Italy? They pretty much must defeat Mexico to advance, but our Soouthern neighbors seem to have woken from the slumber this month. And of course, our own boys in red, white, and blue need only a tie against Poland to advance.</p>
