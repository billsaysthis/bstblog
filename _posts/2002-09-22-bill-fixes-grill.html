<p><a href="http://www.bluerhino.com">Blue Rhino</a>, which is definitely an odd name for a company in the propane gas tank business, sells (via OSH) the tanks I use for my wonderful Weber grill. When one tank is empty, I simply take it back to the store, pay a few dollars, and get a new, full one to take home. Unfortunately, allegedly for safety reasons per one source and for profitability reasons according to another, Blue Rhino stopped making the tanks with quick release connectors and that's the type I had. In order to continue using my grill I needed to change the hose.</p>
<p>This necessitated a call to Weber. They, no surprise, wanted money for this part: $19.95 plus shipping. I, who felt this change was something Weber ought to have dealt with directly, said no way and made a fuss. Fortunately for my blood pressure, Weber had told their customer service reps to offer the part at no charge to customers who made a fuss. So the other day a hose showed up.</p>
<p>But I will be the first to tell you that I'm not your go-to guy on anything mechanical. My big accomplishment to date has been assembling a very complex office desk, back in 1987. Generally my big skill is changing lightbulbs. So I called in the old pro to do the job but because of my shameful lack of tools, he was only able to remove the old hose. The Sweet One and I headed back to OSH for an open face wrench to match the hose's nut (7/16") and a full gas tank and on return home, and cushion yourself for the shock, I was able to install the new piece! I know you all want proof so here you go:</p>
