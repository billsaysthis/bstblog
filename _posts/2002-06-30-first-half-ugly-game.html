<p>Brazil had the better shots on goal though Germany seemed more in control, with tighter marking, keeping Brazil from getting into rhythym. Neither team has been able to pass through the middle third; Germany has been passing back to Kahn and using his big boot while Brazil is getting long balls out of the back line over the top along with a couple of long runs by Lucio and Cafu. Italian Pierluigi Collina, four time FIFA referee of the year and no questions about quality or favoritism, showed with two early yellows that he wasn't going to allow much though he did miss a clear dive by Ronaldinho.</p>
<p>Oliver Khan, as predicted, has been the difference so far with Germany missing Ballack and Brazil able to sneak through for several good shots by Kleberson and Ronaldo. If the German backline doesn't get better in the back 18 yards, Khan won't be enough by himself.</p>
