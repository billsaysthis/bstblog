<p>Greenbeanz: <a href="http://www.greenbeanz.com/">Dr Atkins Diet &amp; Low Carb Specialists</a>. Two stores, in Fremont and San Ramon, with a third coming in a few months in San Jose. Did some serious shopping at this place, they have an excellent selection and good prices, also available online, plus the occasional class from one of the owners. Very helpful staff who know the products because they eat them.</p>
