<p>The Reds made it through the Champions League second round a few weeks ago for a quarterfinal matchup against German club Bayern Leverkusen, currently the <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/soccernet/editorial/top25.html" title="Note that there is nor permanent link for this article so the table will look different in about two weeks">top-ranked club in the world</a>. Today LFC hosted the Germans and <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/championsleague/2001/20020403/reports/46296_full.html">came out on top 1-0</a> on a goal by captain Sami Hyypia in the 44th minute. A major victory indeed, even with the goal coming from a surprise source, a defender who put in only his second ball in 26 European matches. Next Tuesday will see the return match in Germany and the Reds need only a tie to advance for what looks like a semi-final against rival Manchester United. The boys are doing well in the Premiership as well, sitting in second a point behind Arsenal with four matches to go (Arsenal has five left), and are in a good position to pull off a double given their recent mastery over ManU.</p>
