<p><b>Liverpool 5, Germany 1</b></p>
<p>In World Cup qualifying today, <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/worldcup/2001/20010901/reports/germany_england_full.html">Liverpool took apart Germany</a>. Well, really it was the English national side that did the trick but Red players scored all the goals, <a href="http://www.soccernet.com//images/england/national/owengotcha_rk.jpg">Michael Owens</a> leading the way with <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/worldcup/news/2001/0901/20010901engquotes.html">a hat trick</a>. This puts England in excellent position to move through to the finals with a game in hand on Germany and the next match at home against Albania on Wednesday. The win was England's first in Germany since 1965 and only the second home loss ever in Cup qualifying for the Germans.
