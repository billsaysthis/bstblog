<p>One bit I forgot to mention <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2005_02_13_blog_archive.phtml#110888079140981115">last night</a>, being sleepy and all, was the <a href="http://gardenstate.typepad.com/zach_braffs_garden_state_/2005/02/smile.html#comments">amazing number of comments Zach Braff's blog gets</a>, 1368 in the linked entry and 1878, 3068 and 1231 in the next most recent entries (as of this moment, of course) and quick perusals don't show any obvious comment spam unfairly bulking up the totals. That's not to say some comments don't link to people's own sites, just no Viagra, Cialis, penis enlargers or cheap mortgage pitches. I don't surf around looking for this so other celebrity bloggers may get similar or higher totals but wow, you could spend your life just reading all of them though I'm sure Braff doesn't. Just looking at the quantities from time to time does seem like a nice ego booster in reward for doing the blog.</p>
