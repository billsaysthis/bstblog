<p><b>Tivo: Bill's new toy</b></p>
<p>You'd think that after 20 years of having a VCR, it would be enough. But no, not really, and anyway new toys are so cool, so I got myself a <a href="http://www.tivo.com/flash.asp?page=discover_index">TiVo</a> yesterday. So after some mild but annoying problems setting up the machine--hello! have we heard of <a href="http://www.useit.com">usability testing</a>?--I've got it working and will never have to miss another episode of <a href="http://www.startrek.com/news/nextonent.asp">Enterprise</a> again! Woohoo!</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Alright! I used Tivo to record three shows while I was out seeing Heist and it worked just fine. Although apparently UltimateTV has a very useful button on its remote that mine doesn't--skip ahead 30 seconds. Oh well.</p>
