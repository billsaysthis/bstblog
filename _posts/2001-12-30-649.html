<p><strong>B2B: Not as dead as all that</strong></p>
<p>Well, this has surely been a crappy year for Internet related stocks, a bad 16-18 months even, but the market appears to be developing some legs. VerticalNet <a href="http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=VERT&amp;script=410&amp;layout=-6&amp;item_id=240787">is acquiring</a> Atlas Commerce for their collaborative sourcing solution, a multi-party private exchange platform. Verticalnet is only paying around $24 million for <a href="http://www.atlascommerce.com">Atlas'</a> expected 2001 revenues of $9.7M; Verticalnet's <a href="http://www.verticalnet.com/company/executive.asp?id={28CA7329-0149-4F67-9235-6360C923BDE1}">CEO</a> sees "remarkable synergies with Atlas Commerce in terms of our shared vision, rich technology assets, target markets and geographical proximity." Ha ha ha, he said synergies.</p>
