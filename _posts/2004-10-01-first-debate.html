<p>"Wrong war, wrong place, wrong time." Could Bush have said it more frequently or more annoying? I don't think so. Truly sad was the President's seeming insistence that stating any position different than his will cause us to lose our War. Reminds me of the so-called adults in the Vietnam era who treated any protestors as traitors. Then when the soldiers came home, these same people treated them like dirt not worthy of their soles.</p>
<p>Rebuttal on the last question. Did Bush's medication wear off? I have no other explanation for the strange and sudden change of topic back to Iraq when the subject was North Korea. And in regard to that huge problem, what was Bush thinking when he insisted that the Chinese would, without question, withdraw from any process if America initiated bilateral talks with the North Koreans?</p>
<p>No doubt in my mind that Kerry presented more cogent arguments, was smoother and a better speaker, but then I went in to this understanding that America cannot afford another term for Bush. So I will be reading the media spin with interest.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Aside:</span> Jim Lehrer did not seem healthy. Seriously. Like he was using all his energy simply to stay upright in his seat.<br /></p>
