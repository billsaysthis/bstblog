<li>Pam is <a href="http://www.pamslife.com/2003_06_01_archives.html#105639887210146776">funny</a>!</li>
<li>Karl: <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/weblog/kmartino/archives/003035.shtml#003035">Learning Music Theory With Java</a></li>
<li>Via <a href="http://www.webmink.net/2003_06_15_oldblog.htm#105624324385413962">Simon</a>: My <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogger_rss.xml">RSS feed</a> should now <a href="http://feeds.archive.org/validator/check?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.billsaysthis.com%2Fblog%2Fblogger_rss.xml">validate</a> due to the Blogger software update. PS - I met Simon a few years back at a Sun internal XML technical briefing, cool guy, but that was the day I totally threw my back out and was an invalid for weeks afterwards.</li>
<li>Now that <a href="http://www.socialtext.com">SocialText</a> has raised a <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0114726/">funding round</a>, they ought to try and hire me. Blogs, enterprises, developers, and so forth, an excellent convergence of my skills. Who reads this knows one of the principals there?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.whump.com/moreLikeThis/index.php3">Whump</a> must have had an amazing time at the <a href="http://www.kpig.com/events/?content=soiree">Soiree</a> yesterday, or else been extremely busy at work reading up on all the cool new schizznit.</li>
<li><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scoble</a> needs to find a new comment system as his provider is apparently out once again.</li>
<li>John Lim has a <a href="http://php.weblogs.com/discuss/msgReader$2701">very informed take</a> on Tim O'Reilly's <a href="http://craphound.com/timreboot.txt">talk at Reboot 2003</a> on <em>The Open Source Paradigm Shift</em>. Though I do wish John would move his blog to a better host.</li>
<li>Multi-axis congratulations and best wishes to <a href="http://www.winterspeak.com/">Zimran</a> on the sheepskin and license; I hope he sees less rain than I did during <a href="http://www.winterspeak.com/2003_06_01_archive.html#200425161">the honeymoon</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sportsfilter.com/comments.cfm/1773">Toe wrestling!</a> World championship toe wrestling, only in England, of course, would such an event occur. Right?</li>
</ul>
