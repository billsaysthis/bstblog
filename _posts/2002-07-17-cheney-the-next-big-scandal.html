<p>President/clown-in-chief Bush <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/17/politics/17CND-PREX.html">says he is sure</a> VP/puppetmaster did nothing wrong as CEO of Halliburton but I'm coming to believe that this will become a very big scandal in the near future. Just how can Bush be sure, I wonder, when the SEC has barely begun it's investigation. Bush even made his own typically ridiculous nonsense statement at yesterday's press conference: Whatever the facts are, Mr. Bush asserted, there will be nothing to embarrass Mr. Cheney. Whatever the facts? So, Mr. President (I'd love to ask at his next Q&amp;A), if you don't know what the facts are, how can you know he did nothing wrong?</p>
<p>MSNBC digs into Cheney's <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/780130.asp?cp1=1">Sticky Business</a> and how its forced him to be absent from the Bush Administration's part of the debate on corporate reform. He won't talk about it, according to his chief political aide: "His view is that it would be a distraction from what he's trying to get done here." Regardless, the current Halliburton management claims the Veep was well aware of the issue behind this controversy, a change in accounting practices that made a large difference in how investors perceived the company's earnings, and he did sign the financial statements. The SEC hasn't come calling yet (and why not?) but Judicial Watch has filed a private lawsuit and using the rope provided by Republicans in the Paula Jones case may be able to force him to give a deposition.</p>
<p>Robert Dallek, a professor of history at Boston University and the author of a two-volume biography of Lyndon B. Johnson, wrote a letter to the NY Times with historical background on KBR: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/17/opinion/L17BIZZ.html">Some Fight Wars; Others Make Money</a>.</p>
<p>Watch for it, it's coming. And it won't be good.</p>
