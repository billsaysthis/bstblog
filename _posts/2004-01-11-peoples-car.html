<p><a href="http://www.vw.com/phaeton">Phaeton</a>: with an MSRP <a href="http://www.car-prices-costs.com/2004-Volkswagen-Phaeton.html">starting at over $64,000</a>, I think Volkswagon is barking up the wrong tree; this is not a car VW should have put in production. No matter what the <a href="http://www.detnews.com/2003/autosconsumer/0311/13/g03-322789.htm">Detroit News might say</a>. When the company needs to run TV commercials explaining why you should pay them more money for a car than they've ever tried to charge before, the execs ought to realize the battle is lost before it's even begun.</p>
