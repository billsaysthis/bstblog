<p>We were a bit restless after dinner last night and planning on seeing this Vin Diesel comedy sooner rather than later, so TS1 and I got off our duffs and went to the 9:00 showing. Despite generally poor reviews, we both enjoyed <a href="http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/pacifier/">The Pacifier</a> and thought it compared well to, say, Arnold's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099938">Kindergarden Cop</a> (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/kindergartencoppg13brown_a0adc1.htm">reasonably similar warnings</a> about suitability for children under, say, nine too), which we also enjoyed.</p>
<p>As I proclaimed in <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_08_11_blog_archive.phtml#85335432">my review of xXx</a>, I think Diesel has the charisma to be a major action star; this is really his first comedy, though, and he needs to develop a better understanding of the difference in rhythm and timing if he wants to break out of that genre. Director Adam Shankman, following up the Steve Martin/Queen Latifah <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing Down the House</span>, manages to smooth around the edges and writers Tom Lennon and Robert Ben Garant (partners on Comedy Central's <span style="font-style:italic;">Reno 911</span>, last year's Jimmy Fallon English language remake of <span style="font-style:italic;">Taxi</span>, cult troupe <span style="font-style:italic;">The State</span>) thrown in a bit more creative whackiness than we often get in big studio fish out of water comedies.</p>
<p>For instance, there's a subplot pitting Lt. Shane Wolfe (Diesel) against Vice Principal/Wrestling Coach Murney (Brad Garrett) over the behavior of oldest son Seth (Max Thieriot). Even lightly-used romantic interest Lauren Graham, playing the school principal, is taken in when Seth dyes his hair blonde and a Nazi armband is found in his locker. Lennon and Garant pull this one straight out of their lower body opening, so unexpected that I refuse to spoil it, but suffice to say much laughter ensued when Diesel's bus chase on a little girl bicycle uncovered the reasoning. Later on, Wolfe and the Murninator settle their differences on the wrestling mat that also yields a couple of good laughs.</p>
<p>Laughter, after all, is the only useful measure of this type of movie. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Pacifier</span> is entertainment, not art, and though there is a bit of the subversive via the scripters we're after something different in watching this than, say, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2005_02_27_blog_archive.phtml#111008261674308264">Heat</a> or <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2005_01_09_blog_archive.phtml#110559560247743984">The Station Agent</a>. Judged in this light, let's list it as moderately successful.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">recommended</span></p>
<p>Amusingly, this film beat out the favored <a href="http://www.mgm.com/becool/">Be Cool</a> at the box office <a href="http://movies.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_4974.php/Vin_Diesel_Tops_the_US_Weekend_Box_Office">by over 25%</a>, $30.2M v. $23.5M.</p>
