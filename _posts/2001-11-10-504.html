<p><b>E-bombs: the "Oh Shit" weapon</b></p>
<p>Scoble <a href="http://scobleizer.manilasites.com/2001/11/09">points us</a> to this Popular Mechanics article on <a href="http://popularmechanics.com/science/military/2001/9/e-bomb/print.phtml">the E-bomb</a>. As the subhead says, "In the blink of an eye, electromagnetic bombs could throw civilization back 200 years. And terrorists can build them for $400." This is scary shit because we here in America, and especially in Silicon Valley, are far too dependent on electric power, computers and telecommunication to support our lives. A few of these, reasonably well-placed, could destroy us.</p>
