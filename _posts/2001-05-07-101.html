<p>Yes, it is true; on Friday I slipped into my fifth decade. Everyone asks how I feel but of course I live life one day at a time so there wasn't anything explosive about the day. Friday was a good day, for which I'm glad. My girlfriend took me to lunch, I had dinner with <a href="http://home.pacbell.net/bnevins/">my buddy</a> and got to drive his <a href="http://www.us.porsche.com/english/boxster/default.htm">Porsche Boxster</a> (which was very cool), and when I got home my girlfriend and her daughter had decorated my house with flowers, <a href="http://www.scoobydoo.com/">balloons</a>, and cupcakes with candles. Having a three year old sing you <a href="http://www.happybirthday.com/">Happy Birthday</a> is wonderful! It's all good, for sure, but it is weird to say, "Yes, I'm 40."</p>
