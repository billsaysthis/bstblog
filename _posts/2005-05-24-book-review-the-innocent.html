<p>Harlan Coben's latest mystery, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/posts.g?blogID=2791351">The Innocent</a>, was a great read. I think he got this book a level higher than last year's <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_05_09_blog_archive.phtml#108458786182961786">Just One Look</a>, though there are striking similarities between the two. Once again a man is thrown into a catastrophic situation that threatens his life and those he loves by an outsider. <span style="font-style:italic;">Innocent</span>, though, goes for the post-modern anti-hero approach in giving the lead characters more depth than before. I could almost hear Harlan's mental muscles at certain decision points in the story, all to the good.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">recommended</span></p>
