<p>I'm running a race between a bullet and the carcinoma<br />
Telling ugly truths from the pulpit of a concert stage<br />
Won't have to face the aftermath of my derision<br />
No time, there's no time left, no time left to waste.</p>
<p>I hardly believed what I heard from the doctor<br />
Can't be my time yet to go away<br />
Guess all those years of livin' hard<br />
Had a price after all to pay, a mighty price to pay.</p>
<p>So let me tell you child, what knowledge I have gleaned<br />
There's no one worth your pity and no one worth your hate<br />
No one who needs your bullet, no one who needs your fist<br />
Everyone needs your hand, everyone needs your love.</p>
<p>I'm running a race between a bullet and the carcinoma<br />
Telling ugly truths from the pulpit of a concert stage<br />
Won't have to face the aftermath of my derision<br />
No time, there's no time left, no time left to waste.</p>
<p>The talking heads on your screen sure love their voice<br />
Sayin' what they will to get attention, all the hard emotions<br />
Crank up the volume on their spittle, the volume on their rage<br />
I cry to see the crowds they gather round.</p>
<p>Look closely at what they're pitching and find the meat inside<br />
Don't stop on your first reaction, keep thinking for yourself<br />
Is he asking you out of greed, appealing to your fear<br />
Or is she asking you out of optimism, hope and love?</p>
<p>Tribes don't matter<br />
Clans don't matter<br />
States don't matter<br />
Countries don't matter<br />
Religions don't matter</p>
<p>People... people... people matter</p>
<p>Now I'm running a race between a bullet and the carcinoma<br />
Telling ugly truths from the pulpit of a concert stage<br />
Won't have to face the aftermath of my derision<br />
No time, there's no time left, no time left to waste.</p>
<p>Remember, you're what matters and you've got no time to waste.</p>
