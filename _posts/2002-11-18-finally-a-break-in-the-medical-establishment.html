<p>In an <a href="http://www.canada.com/health/story.html?id=%7B9F253DDC-A5E8-46C6-891D-8AA56403B122%7D">Associated Press story</a> on the wires today, we get some very positive Atkins Diet news:</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;margin-right:20px;">At least three formal studies of the Atkins diet have been presented at medical conferences over the past year, and all have reached similar results. The latest, conducted by Dr. Eric Westman of Duke University, was presented Monday at the annual scientific meeting of the American Heart Association, long a stronghold of support for the traditional low-fat approach.</p>
<p>Of course, with the Sweet One and I well over the 50 pound (combined) loss level in less than three months, we had no doubt on this but to see some Establishment types begin to show positive studies is very nice.</p>
