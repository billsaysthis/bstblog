<p>According to a report on the brand new Huffington Post blogsite, the House of Saud <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/thenewswire/archive/2005/05/embargoed-book-claims-sau_1.html">has developed a deadman's switch</a> that includes radioactive dirty bombs that will decimate their oil fields for decades and is intended for use if the royal family believes its survival and control of Saudi Arabia is threatened. Not the country, mind you, just their position of power. Way to lead your nation, dudes!</p>
