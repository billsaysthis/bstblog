<p><em>Enterprise</em> just went to the last commercial break on the season finale with Archer seemingly caught up in a massive explosion. But you know when we get back he'll have been pulled out by a transporter in the nick of time. Sad how writers can't find more believable ways to bring out suspense in such a rich context.</p>
<p><em>After the break:</em> Well, smack me in the face--the writers sure did come up with a final few minutes that twisted past anything I expected! WWII fighters and blue-skinned aliens with lots of sharp teeth and no antenna. Now I am interested to see what'll happen Friday nights this Fall.</p>
