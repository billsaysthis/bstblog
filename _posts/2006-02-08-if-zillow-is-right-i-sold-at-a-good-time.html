<div>New Seattle real estate startup <a href="http://www.zillow.com">Zillow</a> has a pretty cool application according to my analysis after some simple testing. The NY Times was apparently impressed too, featuring them on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/08/business/08real.html?_r=1">business page today</a>, and SiliconBeat has <a href="http://www.siliconbeat.com/entries/2006/02/07/zillow_newest_addition_to_booming_real_estate_space.html">a positive writeup</a> as well. We sold our little condo six months ago for what I thought was a sweet price and Zillow says it was sweet price indeed; their <a href="http://www.zillow.com/howto/Zestimate.z">ZEstimate</a> of its current value is nearly $30,000 less than the selling price (using the refining wizard dropped the current value another $12k!) and more than the top end of the Value Range of $388,442 - $480,928.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zillow.com/HomeDetails.z?zprop=19517959">Zillow.com - 67 Gladys Ave, Mountain View, CA 94043</a></p>
<p>The really interesting thing about Zillow for me is that the company demonstrates yet again the way in which the Internet enables industry-smashing changes. Where buyers and sellers have been dependent on poor scraps of information from newspapers, word of mouth and (naturally) biased agents and brokers we now have tools based on accurate and fresh data. <i>Suh-weet</i>!</div>
