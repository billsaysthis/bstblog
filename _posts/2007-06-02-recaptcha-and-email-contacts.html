<div><a href="http://recaptcha.net/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/logo2-nobottom.gif" style="border:medium none;float:left;margin-right:6px;" alt="reCAPTCHA logo" /></a>I came across a new project this week called <a href="http://recaptcha.net/">reCAPTCHA</a> that promises to deliver some social good while helping block spambots from harvesting email addresses. This project from the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/">School of Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a> has two pieces: on-demand generation of those odd images containing letters and number one must correctly type before, say, creating an account or posting to many websites and a similar feature that blocks access to an email address by requiring the same thing be done before it's revealed.</div>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">CAPTCHA</a> is the geek made up acronym for those images, which are generally random strings. The reCAPTCHA project puts a community twist by getting the string from images of book image scans from the <a href="http://www.archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>, so not only are our resources protected but the effort in deciphering the image also helps get more books digitized. To decrease the probability of spammer-controlled machines beating the image--real words are considered simpler to recognize by software, which is why random sets are used--users must type in two words. For accessibility support, an audio test is available as well.</p>
<p>On <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/">billsaysthis.com</a> I've used it to link my name, towards the bottom of the right sidebar, to my email. Please <a href="http://mailhide.recaptcha.net/d?k=01l_cM4JmTDpKsoK1vme9ucA==&amp;c=nJEfQYhOW8I2I0nvxUzQAG5OoOdNI7AensemVDIPcc4=" title="this link may or may not work in the RSS feed version">give it a try</a> and let me know if it works for you. I expect to use it in a new Ruby on Rails project that will be out soon and wherever I put an email or create resource link.</p>
