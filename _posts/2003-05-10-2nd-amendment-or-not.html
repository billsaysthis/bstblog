<p>When a mother <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/54/30635.html">holds a gun</a> to her son's head, that's when we should understand to the point of certainty that people don't need to have guns. Frankly, the only logical reason I've ever heard given for having one is hunting for those who enjoy it and for them rifles are sufficient, with the rifles stored in a club facility near or at the hunting grounds. The current push in Congress to give gun manufacturers immunity from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/09/nyregion/09GUN.html">lawsuits</a> is beyond absurd. The NRA can kiss my First Amendment-protected ass if they think different but I sure wish they'd cut out the <a href="http://www.nraila.org/Faqs.asp?FormMode=Call&amp;LinkType=Section&amp;Section=24">idiotic</a> <a href="http://www.nraila.org/Faqs.asp?FormMode=Call&amp;LinkType=Section&amp;Section=18">arguments</a> proclaiming that every gun is a good gun.</p>
