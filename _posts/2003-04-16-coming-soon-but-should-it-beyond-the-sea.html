<p><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Spacey,+Kevin">Kevin Spacey</a>, finally with the clout to get it done, makes his dream film, <a href="http://www.mdpworldwide.com/mdp/movies.asp?movieID=13">a biography of singer Bobby Darin</a>. What most of us don't remember, but all the publicity for this film points out, is that Darin knew from his mid-teens that he would die young due to a heart defect and did, indeed, die from it in 1973 at 37. In between Darin made sure he succeeded at becoming a star and leaving his mark on the world.</p>
<p>Spacey, though, is already in his mid-40s and will need either serious makeup or digital fx to succeed in this role, which will also cover his marriage to Sandra Dee. Who'll be portrayed by the 20 year old <em>Blue Crush</em> hottie Kate Bosworth.</p>
<p>Further, Spacey plans to direct the film, something he's only done once before and let's be nice and just say that <a href="http://www.pyramid.net/natesmovies/albino.htm">Albino Alligator</a> wasn't well received. One can only speculate that Spacey would likely be much better served by bringing in a younger actor to play Darin and satisfying himself with director and producer credits.</p>
