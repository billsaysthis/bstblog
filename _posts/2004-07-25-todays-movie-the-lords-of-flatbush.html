<p>I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071772/">The Lords of Flatbush</a>&nbsp;this afternoon--blame TiVo--but it was just so bad I can't be bothered to write much of anything about it. The script was sad, the acting crackled like wrapping paper being torn off an unwanted gift and the faux-'50s soundtrack was, well, faux. Not as if there aren't a zillion tunes that were real hits in the era. Let's just say that <em>Grease</em> wthout being a musical was what this flick wanted to be and <em>American Graffiti</em> and <em>American Hot Wax</em> were contemporaries that were worth watching.</p>
<p><em>ugggggggggghhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!</em><br /></p>
