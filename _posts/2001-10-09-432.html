<p><b>Today's book: Section 31: Abyss</b></p>
<p>The third book in the Section 31 quartet is a <a href="http://www.psiphi.org/cgi/upc-db/0671774832.html">Deep Space Nine episode</a>, set <a href="http://anyboard.net/et/actors/nana/posts/6410.html">post-relaunch</a> and continuing from <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_07_29_blog_archive.phtml#4893714">Avatar</a>, which features Julian Bashir, Ezri Dax, Taran'atar, and Ro Laren. The quartet is 'assigned' by Section 31 (well, Bashir is assigned and he takes the others aling) to track down and prevent another genetically enhanced human from using a captured Jem'Hadar hatchery to unleash horror on the Alpha Quadrant in the wake of the Dominion War. In a nice touch, a few pages are used to update several continuing stories (Kassidy's pregnancy, Jake Sisko's disappearance, who is Commander Vaughn). Here's an old but interesting interview with co-author <a href="http://startrek.about.com/library/weekly/aa121900.htm?once=true&amp;">Jeff Lang</a></p>
