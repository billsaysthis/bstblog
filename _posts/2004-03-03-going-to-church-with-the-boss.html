<p>I'm listening to a live recording of Bruce and the E Streeters doing a beautiful version of Jimmy Cliff's <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~maroen/engels/lyrics/manyrive.htm">Many Rivers to Cross </a>right now, very calming and uplifting! Slow, gospel backup vocals, Danny providing the primary instrumental backing on organ and some very subtle guitar strumming but not nearly long enough at 3:37</p>
