<p><a href="http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20050324005428&amp;newsLang=en">AOLMusic</a> will have the first single from <a href="http://www.sonymusicstore.com/store/catalog/MerchandiseDetails.jsp?selectionId=93900&amp;sms=ast-brucespringsteen">Devils &amp; Dust</a> available for the listening pleasure for 24 hours beginning tonight at midnight; have to see if that means Eastern Standard Time or what, maybe I can hear it before bed time. Song title: same as the record. Second, he'll be on <a href="http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/storytellers/series.jhtml">VH1's Storytellers</a> the weekend of April 23/24, right before release on the 26th and I wonder if this will be the same video that will be on the backside of DualDisc format CD.

<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Related:</span> Little Steven's radio series <a href="http://www.sirius.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Sirius/CachedPage&amp;c=Channel&amp;cid=1104779639688&amp;flash=flash">Underground Garage</a> is now on Sirius (the other satellite radio service ;). Still, I'm not ready to fork over yet another monthly fee when I barely listen to radio anyway.</p>
<p>Hope I've reached your optical sensors in time for your auditory enjoyment of numero uno!</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Later:</span> Not a song I instantly love but very interesting. The repeated overlays of some guy saying "AOL First Listen" are getting in the way of my enjoyment.</p>
