<p>Today is the 50th anniversary of the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/19/opinion/19THU3.html">for treason</a>; today also saw the publication of <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/coulter.htm">an excerpt</a> of Ann Coulter's new book, allegedly also non-fiction, called <i>Treason</i>, in which she asserts that the late Senator Joe McCarthy was a true patriot and not the power-hungry leader of a witchhunt he is remembered as today. While there turned out to be some truth to the claims regarding Julius Rosenberg, there is no truth in the absurd claims of Ms. Coulter.</p>
<p>Coulter probably should have been named Today's Asshat, by the way. At least the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_06_15_blog_archive.phtml#200432993">last recipient</a> of the honor had the good sense to resign the next day.</p>
