<p>One of the great things about this time of year is that <del>soccer</del>football is the only real sport going on. Euro2004, MLS, US World Cup 2006 qualifying. I think if this were the only televised sport I'd be just as happy.</p>
<p>Minor prediction: The Czechs will play hard enough tomorrow to drop Germany out of the tournament. If the Germans lose, even a draw by the other two squads in Group D will be enough to push Holland (not Latvia, I think) through and a German draw combined with a win by either team in the other game gives the same result. I think this is nearly destined, to make a trio of huge nations crashing out of the first round: Germany, Italy, and Spain. Can't really put Croatia up with them, especially since that would imply England was not going to go through if form held.</p>
