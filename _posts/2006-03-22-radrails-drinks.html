<p>Had a beer with the three developers of the very cool <a href="http://www.radrails.org/">RadRails</a> Ruby on Rails IDE tonight (along with Dan Kohn) and, let me tell you, these guys are all just barely 21 and able to buy a beer but they have more than enough smarts to pull off a project like this in less than a year (from starting work to the expected 1.0 at or just before <a href="http://www.railsconf.com/">RailsConf</a> in June).</p>
<p>Coming to an event like EclipseCon, which is what brings the three juniors to the valley from the Rochester Institute of Technology, could have been overwhelming. Heck they're the youngest people at this expensive conference, had jobs offers and more all day, party invites from Microsoft, and yesterday won the <a href="http://www.radrails.org/blog/show/56">Eclipse Best Developer Tool Award</a>! But Kyle, Marc and Matt are really cool and will be going places, though the places will have to wait the 15 months remaining until college graduation.</p>
