<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/15/science/15OLD.html?ex=1066795200&amp;en=cafe2b8caa2c8765&amp;ei=5062&amp;partner=GOOGLE">How big are your lipoproteins?</a></p>
<p>It's <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/03/10/15/1214200.shtml?tid=126&amp;tid=154&amp;tid=185&amp;tid=95">Mozilla Release Day</a> with three major projects going gold(-ish) and other services and projects announced. Though I cannot tell you why, this site looks strange viewed in Firebird, unless today's release fixed something. I hope.</p>
<p>Go <a href="http://www.taikonaut.com/">Taikonauts</a>! Humanity <em>needs</em> to be in space.</p>
<p>Palestinians <a href="http://www.reuters.co.uk/newsPackageArticle.jhtml?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=388521&amp;section=news">blow up Americans</a> who are there to help them, crowd cheers. The Americans were in the Gaza Strip to set up Palestinian professors with academic scholarships.</p>
<p><em>Update, 30 minutes later:</em> Installed Firebird 0.7 but there is no change in the way this site's pages are displayed (badly). There must be something in my CSS which Firebird is unhappy with since the problem doesn't happen in Mozilla, Internet Explorer or Opera. Uggh.</p>
