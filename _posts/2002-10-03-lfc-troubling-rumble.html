<p>The season has gone well so far for Liverpool: sitting only two points behind Arsenal at the top of the Premiership and a key victory yesterday to put them in good standing to advance in the Champions League. Now this: <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/england/news/2002/1003/20021003lfcheskey.html">I want to play up front, Heskey tells Houllier</a>. Uh oh!</p>
<p>I'd always wondered about the way European sides, the top ones at least, stockpile extra players. Especially up front on teams that play 4-4-2 alignments (two forwards, that is). Liverpool has <a href="http://liverpoolfc.tv/team/squad/owen/">Michael Owen</a>, who is only 22 years old and simply owns the righthand forward's spot and then Heskey, El Hadji Diouf, and Milan Baros; even John Arne Riise, who's been playing defense recently, has had a start or two up front and done well. Aside from Arsenal and Man Utd., these four would be stars on any English side. None of the strikers, other than Owen who came up through the club's youth system, were gotten cheaply either. Heskey cost about $16 million two years ago, Baros about $5.5M a year ago, and Diouf was the big acquisition, for $15M, over the summer.</p>
<p>Manager Gerard Houllier is not one to take public complaints lightly. At least once in the past month he told the press he would not tolerate any whiners on the club. A fan poll on the club's website after yesterday's win gave Heskey <a href="http://liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N136936021003-1635.htm">man of match honors</a>. Sounds like a collision, not a good one for the team with the transfer window shut tight until January, could be on the way.</p>
