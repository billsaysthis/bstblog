<p>I added Bill's Movie Reviews to the new <a href="http://www.kritx.com/">kritX review aggregator</a>, will be interesting to see if any traffic flows from it. To do it I had to add a custom field (I used Jonathon's RhymedCode <a href="http://rhymedcode.net/projects/custom-field-gui/">Custom Field GUI</a> to add a Ratings field) and use the hReview microformat in the WordPress template, which wasn't too hard except that the instructions for getting custom fields is weird. Since I don't want to show this extra info, I used CSS to set their display attribute to none. Very clever, I know. I tried out the new Structured Blogging plugin but it's not what I need, too heavy and to hard to control the output. I wonder if any other crews are scanning for hReview formatted material...</p>
