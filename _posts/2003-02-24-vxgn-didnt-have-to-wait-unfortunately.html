<p>The <a href="http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=VXGN&amp;script=410&amp;layout=-6&amp;item_id=385014">results</a> were released at midnight EST. Sadly, they don't appear to be very good. The key fact: "The reduction of infection among the entire sample of volunteers, including all racial groups, was 3.8%." The effect apparently was much stronger on black and Asian minorities but you have to figure that the stock will open under $8 tomorrow morning. <i>Damn!</i></p>
<p><em>Update, 7:40 a.m. PST:</em> Current indications are that the stock, currently held by NASDAQ from opening, will first trade right around $5.80-6.00.</p>
