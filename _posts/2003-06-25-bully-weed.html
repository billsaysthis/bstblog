<p>In the garden<br />
<br />There is a small bush<br />
<br />Growing next to a taller weed.</p>
<p>The bush yearns for sunlight<br />
<br />But the weed is a bully and will not<br />
<br />Let enough light get through.</p>
<p>A refreshing wind wafts<br />
<br />Through the garden yet once again<br />
<br />The bully weed steals most.</p>
<p>The bush spends days<br />
<br />Yearning for the weed to leave<br />
<br />Yearning for the wind and water.</p>
<p>Can a bush dream?<br />
<br />Can a bush lust and long for what is missed?<br />
<br />Surely in some measure.</p>
<p>So then why not<br />
<br />The same for the weed as well?<br />
<br />And well for the weed.</p>
