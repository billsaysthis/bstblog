<p><b>This is what high speed web access is for</b><br />

<p>We are talking about a very high cool quotient here: xdude's <a href="http://www.xdude.com/flashed-mar2001.htm">The Dough</a> and BMW's <a href="http://www.bmwfilms.com">5 Major Shorts</a>. If you have DSL or a cable modem, check these out. And on BMWFilms, download the custom viewer.</p>
<p>And while this isn't strictly a bandwidth hogger, check out <a href="http://www.roadtospringfield.com/">The Road to Springfield</a>, a fan site using voting to determine the best supporting character and to be eligible, the character must have appeared in at least two episodes.</p>
