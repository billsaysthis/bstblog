<p>My friend (and ex-boss) Jim has twin sons who just turned two earlier this month, while Jim himself just changed decades last week, and he stopped by this afternoon for a visit. Let's just say his warning that Liam and Brendan are like little tornados was spot on, though they are both lovely and wonderful and better behaved than their dad gives them credit for. I snapped a few shots but here is the best of all three together:</p>
