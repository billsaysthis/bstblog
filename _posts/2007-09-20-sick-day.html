<p>Oy vey, for sure. Yesterday I wasn't feeling great though I went to Lunch 2.0 at RockYou anyway--hopefully I didn't infect anyone else--and by the time I finally got home just before 4 I was done. Collapsed on the couch, watched the recording of Manchester United's narrow Champions League win at Sporting Clube de Portugal and later most of the Gary Cooper/Patricia O'Neil version of The Fountainhead.</p>
<p>TS1, as always, was a great and attentive nurse.</p>
<p>This morning the symptoms were out in force, runny nose, sneezing, coughing, sore throat. Of course I was supposed to give the PSR team pitch at ProMatch but fortunately one of my mates stepped in. Why I'm still sitting at the computer can only be attributed to a serious electronics addiction but after this the TV goes on.</p>
<p>Everyone hates feeling sick, including me. Your empathy is appreciated.</p>
