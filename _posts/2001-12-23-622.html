<p><strong>Micro-advertising experiment, day eight</strong></p>
<p>Saturday was not so good for the ad, only three visitors yesterday (out of 267 views, 1.12% CTR!) for a total of 35 from 2,985 views for a 1.17% CTR. Less Woohoo, good thing I really liked the dinner and movie last night. Other good things yesterday: 49ers romped and Patriots beat the Dolphins (which is good for the Jets).</p>
