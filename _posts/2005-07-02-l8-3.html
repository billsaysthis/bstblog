<p>I hate MTV, I really do. After waiting all day to see the reunited Pink Floyd and having it come on 15 minutes before the end, these fucktards cut away after less than two minutes to their babbling moronic VJs telling us how cool the concerts were. And to show a few more commercials.</p>
<p>Everybody scream after me: "I hate MTV! They suck worse than a Pauly Shore movie."</p>
