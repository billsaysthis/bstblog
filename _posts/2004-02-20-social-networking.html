<p>Tonight was this month's <a href="http://www.jhtc.org">JHTC</a> meeting, our first at the deluxe new offices of law firm Fenwick &amp; West in beautiful downtown Mountain View. Our speaker was the legendary Reid Hoffman, co-founder of PayPal and, more relevant, social networking service provider <a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a>. A very interesting presentation filled with insight based on real numbers derived from LinkedIn's usage; he's also an engaging speaker who really connected with the audience, answering tough questions easily with good humor. I so want to work for this guy!</p>
