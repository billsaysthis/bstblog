<p>"You would have to cut off both my arms before I let go of him because I would have them both wrapped around him." <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/click/rss/0.91/public/-/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/3667593.stm">So says</a> Liverpool head man Houllier in response to rumors of &#163;20M bids coming from ManU or Arsenal for his captain, Steven Gerrard. Which is good because the midfielder is key to any hope of improvement next season.</p>
