<p><a href="http://www.clancyfaq.com/theredrabbit.htm">Red Rabbit</a> is the new book by Tom Clancy featuring Jack Ryan, the hero of many previous Clancy novels, though this one goes back in time to 1982 and the aftermath of <em>Patriot Games</em>. Janet Maslin, writing in the NY Times (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/15/books/15MASL.html">Clancy's Three-Star Spy Still Fighting the Cold War</a>), has the first in-depth review which I've seen. She claims to have enjoyed the book and, as a total Clancy fan, I hope to as well, but read her article for yourself and see if that attitude comes through. I'm thinking I get this one in paperback or from the library.</p>
<p>Either way, after this tome, there <a href="http://www.clancyfaq.com/Clancy%20Speaks%20Briefly.htm">will only be one last</a> Jack Ryan novel.</p>
