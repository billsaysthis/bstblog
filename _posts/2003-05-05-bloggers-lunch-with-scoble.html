<p>Today was my last chance to get <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scobelized</a> in person before the man moves himself and his wife up to the rainy range of Redmond, so we met up for lunch. Robert is really intelligent and a good conversationalist, not just a wanking blogger, so this is always fun and I'm sad he's leaving the Valley. Although the move is a great opportunity for him and a great hire for Microsoft. The talk ranged from bad CEOs who hang on too long and Warren Buffett's recent <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,5-669779,00.html">CEO pay rant</a> to the relative housing markets here and there to how tough it is to find a job these days. Good luck Rob and don't forget us Valley bloggers!</p>
<p><em>Sidenote:</em> The Buffett link was via MetaFilter, which is having quite the <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/25575">little discussion</a> over the reality of 2nd Richest Man's remarks.</p>
