<p>I watched <a href="http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/drewcareytv/index.jsp?frompage=sitemap">The Drew Carey Show</a> just now. The episode was about Kate dating someone who might have been the Devil (played by Murphy Brown's Grant Shaud) and what should come on but an ad for the caring, sensitive new <a href="http://www.studiosusa.com/maury/">Maury Povich Show</a>. So here's the coincidence: the Devil claimed he invented the whole sensitive guy shtick. (But then the Devil learned that Kate is only a virgin when she's drunk and he stormed off without the gang's souls.)</p>
