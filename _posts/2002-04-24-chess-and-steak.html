<p>Tonight was good, grilled steaks with asparagus and homemade garlic butter. Then I had my butt handed to me on the chessboard. I only really ever play against <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=xmas_01&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=byron_xmas.jpg">Byron</a> but his mind is, as Steve puts it, that of an engineer and mine is...not. Byron sits there, having enjoyed my steaks, smug, calculating three and four moves ahead before choosing while I'm lucky to see all the threats to my pieces. This strikes me as funny since in some ways I'm smarter than him but then again he's forgotten more about computer programming, chemistry and biology in the past month than I've ever known. Ha ha on me.</p>
