<p>What does Pam <a href="http://www.pamslife.com/2003_08_01_archives.html#106190814994601171">mean by</a> "latter-day Yes Meets early Beatles"? I cannot begin to fathom this, some combination of raw, simple guitar chugging music with corporatized, out in the aether art rock. Don't misunderstand, I really like both bands but I just can't see how <a href="http://www.ofarevolution.com/site2003/index.html" title="Official band site, I think">O.A.R.</a> can sound like a mix of them. I listened to a couple of tunes, <em>Hey Girl</em> from both <em>Risen</em> (studio) and <em>Any Time Now</em> (live) and <em>Missing Pieces</em> from <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;uid=CASS70308262020&amp;sql=Aju8gtq3z9u4p">The Wanderer</a> and didn't hear what Pam did but then maybe that's the difference between live performance and studio recording. What it comes down to is I'm glad Pam enjoyed her party evening listening to good rock and roll.</p>
