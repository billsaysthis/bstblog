<p>I sent the following question to a few of my friends, just to see if the online romance is as strong as I'm seeing: Not counting me and my wife, can you tell me how many couples you personally know who met through an online or other type of automated dating system? If the number includes yourself, please say 'me'. 14 of them responded (thanks!) and only two people answered with a zero.</p>
<p>Including me and Vivian, four couples out of the 13 possible (two respondents are single) met this way. That includes me, my sister and one of my best friends. From the 15 responses, we knew of 29 distinct couples. And the couples with which I am personally acquainted, all but one who've gotten together in the last few years met online. So much for tradition.</p>
