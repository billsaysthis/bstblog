<p>The English Premier League 2003-4 season gets started on August 16 (as indicated over in the sidebar, Liverpool opens with a chance for revenge for the last game loss last season against Chelsea) and the teams began their training last week. LFC, training in Switzerland, has played two exhibitions so far and is headed to the Far East for a couple of matches there.</p>
<p>Some of the other big-name teams are coming to America for their warm-up tours and it's being marketed as ChampionsWorld. The opening game is tomorrow night in Seattle with Manchester United against Celtic. Later in the week, the games will include Juventus vs Barcelona, Manchester United vs Club America, Barcelona vs AC Milan, Manchester United vs Juventus, and ending with Manchester United vs Barcelona.</p>
<p>The last game ought to be relatively interesting. One of the big Summer transfer battles was over the Brazilian star Ronaldhino. The midfielder is 23, and has made his club reputation with Paris Saint Germaine, but now he's too big to stay in the French League--they just don't have the money for the big stars, which is why the can have a terrific national team but never produce wins from international club competitions. Man U really wanted him, not only to replace David Beckham but also to give them the creativity and leadership in the middle that Juan Veron should have but never has provided.</p>
<p>FC Barcelona, which started all the hoopla over Beckham but couldn't close that deal, instead pressed and pressed for Ronaldhino's signature. Even after the star's agent/brother told the press that the English side was some small details away from finalizing a transfer, the new leadership at the proud but battered Spanish team did not give up. And though it cost them about $33 million, Barcelona got him. This will be the first meeting between the teams since.</p>
<p>This Sunday, I'll be hosting a couple of SpoFites and their families here for BBQ and that Juventus vs Barcelona game. Would be nice to also take in the Manchester United/Club America clash in the late afternoon together as well but doesn't seem like that will happen. But still very cool, hopefully I'll get some good education and expert insight from the new pals.</p>
