<p>We took advantage of the beautiful weather here today to see the <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ccva/">Iris &amp; B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts</a> at Stanford University. Well, just the first floor, we saved the second for a future visit. The museum is a lovely new building which was reopened in 1999 after closing due to damage from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The biggest permanent attraction is the Rodin Sculpture Garden which features 20 bronzes by Auguste Rodin, including a stunning piece titled "The Gates of Hell." The major current exhibit is called "Aerial Muse: The Art of Yvonne Jacquette." Jacquette is a modern American artist whose distinction, quality of the work aside, is that she flies in small planes or looks at from skyscraper windows and draws or paints <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ccva/Jacquette.jpeg">what she sees</a>. The works exhibited can be broadly divided into daytime and nighttime scenes and I have to say that the nighttime paintings seemed too much a like for my taste, although I did enjoy the greens of many of the daytime pictures. We took some ordinary film pictures, so I'll post them once the come back.</p>
<p>There is a neat quote from Rodin in the exhibit: "Art is the pleasure of the mind which searches into nature and which there defines the spirit by which Nature herself is animated."</p>
