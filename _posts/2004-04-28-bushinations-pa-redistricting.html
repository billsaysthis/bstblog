<p>Sure, this was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/national/AP-Scotus-Redistricting.html">a SCOTUS decision</a> but you can be completely sure that Scalia and Rhenquist were completely in tune with the Administration in upholding Pennsylvania's joke of a congressional map. I especially liked the conservative justices attempt (beaten back, fortunately) to utterly free states from federal oversight of this matter. If by like you understand that I meant sickened to my stomach.</p>
<p>Trust me, put aside any piddly little concerns about Kerry you might have and vote for him in November. Get out of the house and to the polling station, get your absentee ballot to avoid the crap electronic voting machines if that's your preference. But if you can't make that modest expenditure of time and energy, then in 2005 or 2006 don't come around here crying and whining about the sad and terrible events and decisions coming from a second Bush term.</p>
<p>In 1980 I thought that a Reagan win would be terrible and that I ought to consider transferring to a school in Canada or elsewhere if he won but this go round I am much more serious. A small beach community on the eastern coast of Australia sounds better every time I think about it.</p>
