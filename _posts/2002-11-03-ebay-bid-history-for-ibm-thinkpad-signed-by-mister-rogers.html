<p>Okay, this is <a href="http://cgi6.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewBids&amp;item=1573393184">one strange thing</a> for IBM to be auctioning off. Also, this was kind of an odd item. What does Mr. Rogers have to do with IBM or computers that would make this worth more than, say $25 over the asking price (about $1725 according to CNet) for this laptop?</p>
<p>Saw this on MetaFilter, so I assume many people saw it. I found the bid history for this <a href="http://www-132.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=8559815&amp;storeId=1&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=-840">ThinkPad T30</a> to be interesting, however, and quite confusing. For example, right in the middle jabbie118 and then ekjeffrey each made consecutive bids within seconds of their initial bid, raising the price substantially. Also, the last few bidders never got involved until the very end but although the price did not move much beyond their initial bids, not one came back for a second chance.</p>
