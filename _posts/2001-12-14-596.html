<p><strong>LotR: Greeting cards</strong></p>
<p>More tantalizing Lord of the Rings tidbits five days ahead of the FotR release. Media Highway International's RealGreetingCard site has a <a href="http://www.realgreetingcard.com/showcards.asp?CategoryID=310">selection of LotR e-cards</a>; I mention them because they were nice enough to search out my site and send a link request. I tried their site and there are no popup/popunders and they don't appear to use the email information for spam, which is very nice. The NY Times went a little meatier into the subject with a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/specials/advertising/movies/tolkien/index.html">special Tolkien site</a>.</p>
