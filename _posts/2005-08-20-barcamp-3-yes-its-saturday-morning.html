<p>Got a later start this morning than expected but a bunch of new people showed up and we did another round of introductions. I had a chance to say hello to Scott Beale of Laughing Squid and signed up to show RawSugar in 20 minutes--assuming anyone shows in the room. Some people did sleep here though I bugged out after midnight and enjoyed the comfort of my own bed.</p>

<p>Riana is leading a session on user-contributed content sites, commercial and not. "You want to filter the canon of the ages down to bumper stickers?" Riana asked one guy who said he didn't want to read through huge amounts of free content (Project Gutenberg, for instance) to find the two bits useful for him.</p>

<p>A PM from PGP is making the point that this is once again making new from old: letters to the editor, radio talk show callers --&gt; aggregated/hosted blog content. Possibly the business model is filtering; people will pay for Jon Stewart's filtering, MSM editorial factchecking and balance.</p>
