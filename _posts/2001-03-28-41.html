<p><b>Have a few sad laughs</b>
<p>Breakups, as most of us know, can be massively painful. But when a <a href="http://www.psychoexgirlfriend.com/">Psycho exgirlfriend</a> won't let go, it gets even worse. Laughter can often be found in another's pain (think <a href="http://www.cet.com/~rascal/graphics/road-r.gif">Wile E. Coyote</a>), and the voicemails catalogue here go into that sad, twisted space.</p>
<p>Note: I tried to find an official Roadrunner/Wile E. Coyote page on the Looney Tunes/Warner Brothers site but apparently there is no current product and so no page.</p>
