<p>Amazon has the first video from Bruce Springsteen's new release, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EU1PNC/sr=8-1/qid=1143753363/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-2668325-0759860?%5Fencoding=UTF8">We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions</a>, available for the viewing. The DualDisc--who knows what to call things these days--comes out in three weeks but if the rest is more or less like <span style="font-style:italic;">John Henry</span>, the video track, I won't be leaping out of my chair to buy it. Sorry Bruce, I'm happy that you've made music that means so much to you, but it just ain't my thing.</p>
