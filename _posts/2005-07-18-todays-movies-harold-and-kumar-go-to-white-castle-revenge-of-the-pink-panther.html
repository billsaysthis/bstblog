<p>Between unloading boxes and figuring where everything goes we watched a couple of amusing flicks, one recent, one the last of a series from the '60s and '70s. Both enjoyable though and I think the commonality is a bit of turning audience expectations around.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.haroldandkumar.com/">Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle</a> we watch a pair of stoned Asian 20-somethings who only want to get those special burgers cooked at the title chain to quench their munchies. What should be a short, simple drive winds up being an all night comic adventure. At some points the script relies a bit too much on cardboard stereotypes but in general John Cho and Kal Penn succeed with a funny movie that's a level above typical young adult crap like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0186975/">Down to You</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0186975/">A Guy Thing</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078163/">Revenge of the Pink Panther</a> is the final of the five original movies starring Peter Sellers as Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau and one of Sellers' last three movies. To some degree this was a payday movie for him and writer/director Blake Edwards, part of a sequence of three made a dozen years after the first two; those were critical and box office successes and while these did pull in some cash no rave reviews were really expected.</p>
<p>French mobster Douvier (Robert Webber) needs to show his American partners his grip remains strong, so at the suggestion of a lieutenant Clouseau is selected for assassination. Through typical pratfalls and misunderstandings everyone thinks the plan works and insane former boss Chief Inspector Dreyfuss, instantly cured at the news, is brought out to find the killer. At the same time Douvier tosses out his mistress (Dyan Cannon) and in running from her own killers literally bumps into Clouseau; teaming up they of course send Douvier to ruin and Dreyfuss back to the sanitarium.</p>
