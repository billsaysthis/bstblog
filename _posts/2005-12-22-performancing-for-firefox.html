<div>I used <a href="http://performancing.com/user/689" title="View user profile.">Jed Brown</a>'s <a href="http://performancing.com/firefox">Performancing for Firefox</a> to write <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2005_12_18_blog_archive.phtml#113521439771302932">the last post</a> and have to say that it doesn't suck. There was another reason for me to update <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> to 1.5 so I got over my fears of extension incompatibility and did it. Thanks to <a href="http://www.mrtech.com/extensions/local_install/index.html">MR Tech's Local Install</a> extension's ability to force plugins (or Firefox, not sure which) to ignore the max compatible version 'feature' I still have everything I need. Very cool tool, Performancing connected to Blogger and WordPress with no errors which I cannot say about (the latest stable build of) <a href="http://www.flock.com">Flock</a> though I continue to use and enjoy it anyway.</div>
