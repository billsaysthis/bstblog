<p>[A letter to the editors, NY Times]</p>
<p>Michael Denis (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/07/opinion/l07friedman.html?ex=1257570000&amp;en=b199476aa1cd9671&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">Letters, 11/7/4</a>) asks that New Yorkers "consider the opinion of those who feel that abortion is murder and that homosexual marriage is wrong. You may not agree with these positions, but to dismiss our beliefs is to invite further division." He goes on to ask for "real dialog."</p>
<p>I do disagree with those positions but would ask him and his fellow believers to explain how to surmount this divide, how to have a real dialog, without simply giving in; deriving one's life rules from a literal belief in the Bible seems to leave little room for compromise. Further, even if abortion remains legal and gay marriage becomes so, Denis does not need to avail himself of them while under his regime we have no choice. What, I ask, is more the middle ground, allowing individuals to choose for themselves or having one side decide for all?</p>
