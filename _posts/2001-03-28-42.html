<p><b>Prozac by any other name</b>
<p>Eli Lilly must have some really smart scientists on the payroll. After all, they came up with a completely <a href="http://www.sarafem.com/what_is_pmdd.html">new disease</a> that only women get (unless there is a man out there menstruating) and, by golly, their big (but soon to go off patent) money maker Prozac, under a <a href="http://www.sarafem.com/about.html">new name</a>, is just the ticket to fixing it.</p>
<p>This is fairly normal PharmCo practice, though: <a href="http://www.zyban.com/">Zyban</a>, for example, is just a more-expensive version of <a href="http://www.wellbutrin.com/">Wellbutrin</a> from the good folks at GlaxoSmithKline.</p>
