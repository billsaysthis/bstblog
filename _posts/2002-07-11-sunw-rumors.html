<p>Finally a positive one, let's hope the rumor is true. From Yahoo! Finance InPlay today:</p>
<p>"2:24PM Sun Microsystems rises on upgrade rumor (SUNW) 5.23 +0.18: Trading floors are buzzing with talk that a tier one broker is about to upgrade SUNW today; while we can't confirm this, we're hearing that the analyst believes the stock is cheap and that recent results have been strong."</p>
