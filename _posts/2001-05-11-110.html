<p><b>The Oklahoma conspiracy</b><br />

<p>Did Timothy McVeigh act alone on April 19, 1995, when he blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City killing 168 people? Conspiracy theory cranks aside, Andrew Gumbel presents in a <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=71520">special report</a> in the UK-based <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/">Independent</a> online newspaper strong evidence that he did not and, indeed, was part of a right wing, Aryan supremacist group that robbed almost two dozen banks across the Midwest to finance their political battle. This article is very detailed; some of you may prefer the <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=71599">summary article</a> instead although the longer version is well-written and quite readable.</p>
<p>Separately, <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010511/ts/mcveigh_town_dc_1.html">unsurprising government bumbling</a> has delayed McVeigh's execution until at least June 11.</p>
