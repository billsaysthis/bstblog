<p>Tony Hillerman has been writing mysteries featuring Navajo policemen Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn for more than 35 years so it's not surprising that 2003's <a href="http://www.tonyhillermanbooks.com/chee/sinister_pig.html">Sinister Pig</a> works like a quart of the higest quality motor oil. Quickly set up a mystery death for the cops, though we get told first just what's up, and then tie it in with an odd stop made by the woman Chee has trouble admitting to himself he loves. Bring in a corporate tycoon--remember this was written as the Tyco, Worldcom and Enron scandals were breaking--either sociopathic or believing the slightest inconvenience justifies any action he makes. Slick, smooth, smart. Highly readable.</p>
