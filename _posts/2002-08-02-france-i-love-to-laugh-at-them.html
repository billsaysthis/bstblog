<p>Face it, France sucks. Sure, they had some great painters and thinkers in the past. But they had a national case of amnesia, from which they never recovered, over their need to have America save their bacon twice this century from the Germans and spend big bucks for the last 57 years making sure it doesn't happen a third time. They're a nation of anti-Semites. They worship Jerry Lewis. So any time something happens to infuriate these people, I smile.</p>
<p>The latest bit of good news and slap in the derriere is a ruling by the European Union, formerly a captive branch of their government, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,768050,00.html">forcing the government to abandon a law</a> requiring all food labels and food advertising to be printed in French even if it is printed in another EU nation and imported to France. Making the whole thing even funnier is that the case was triggered by a French supermarket chain which was fined for selling some bottles of Coke labeled in English.</p>
