<p>The <a href="http://www.robinwilliamstour.com/">Robin Williams Tour</a> is not going to stop in San Francisco! And he freaking lives here! What's up with that? I read a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/27/arts/theater/27WILL.html">great review in the NY Times</a> and thought, oh boy, this is one show I'd bust a gut to see. Only to find out no shows anywhere near here. What a bummer! Still, I'm looking forward to his new film, <a href="http://deathtosmoochymovie.warnerbros.com/splash.html">Death to Smoochy</a>, and he will be playing the bad guy, a wacked out serial killer, in a movie with Al Pacino that will be out in the next few months called <a href="http://dontcloseyoureyes.warnerbros.com/">Insomnia</a>.</p>
