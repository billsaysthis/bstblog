<p>If an email must include nonsense at the beginning to try and sneak through spam filters, then I cannot begin to imagine how foolish or ignorant a recipient must be to actually believe the email to be valid. And of course one must have an account at the bank in question.<br />

<p>But then again, my email client is configured to show messages sent in HTML as plain text. Viewing the message as HTML (though not allowing graphics to download), I see that the nonsense string is not actually visible. Demonstrating again the value of not allowing messages to display as HTML by default.</p>
