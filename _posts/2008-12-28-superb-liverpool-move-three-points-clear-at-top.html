<p>That's not my headline, it's from <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sow/news?slug=reu-england_pix&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns">Reuters' match report</a>, though I agree wholeheartedly. Five goals on the road today against a Newcastle side that's begin climbing back from a horrid start pairs nicely with Friday's 3-0 slam of Bolton, a +7 on goal difference tally.</p>
<p>First place after 20 games, three points clear of Chelsea and top of the table as 2008 comes to end. For the first season in many we aren't sitting third, fourth or fifth looking up at Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal and happy to have a firm grasp on a Champions League slot--this season is our opportunity to win the Premier League for the first time and add back a cushion to our lead over United for all time top flight titles.</p>
<p>Steven Gerrard lead the way today with two goals and an assist, showing why he wears the armband by captaining a lineup with five subs in the starting XI. A lineup with none of the normal strikers up front either, a reward to Dirk Kuyt for all his hard work as right winger.</p>
<p>Sami Hyypia recalled his thrilling partnership with Jamie Carragher in central defense, putting one in with his head too. Emiliano Insua, our Argentine fullback who turns 20 in 10 days, made another strong appearance covering for the injured Alvaro Arbeloa. Yossi Benayoun was creative, setting up Gerrard on the first goal, and Ryan Babel celebrated a rare start with the third goal.</p>
<p>The game was also good news because Javier Mascherano started on his return from an injury layoff and Martin Skrtel got on for the last few minutes, his first appearance since tearing a knee ligament at Manchester City October 5th.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Liverpool's Challengers</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Number two Chelsea</span> were dominant at Craven Cottage this morning but the match ended 2-2 as American international Clint Dempsey got free twice in the six yard box and put set piece kicks from Simon Davies in the net both times. His second, in the 90th minute, was a real spirit killer. The Blues had to overcome tough first half hamstring injuries to Alex and Florent Maluda but credit Fullham with strong defense that mostly shut down both of Chelsea's speedy, aggressive fullbacks.</p>
<p>Rumors are just rumors until they come true though I do wonder if Scolari will want to stick out the season at Stamford Bridge if he gets no spending cash in January except what he takes in by selling. Alex and Malouda are the two most frequently touted to leave but their prices will certainly be impacted by the second injury each has had in the half season.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Arsenal</span> scraped out a 1-0 victory today over a Portmouth side which has struggled seriously since former Gunner captain Tony Adams took over from Harry Redknapp but Arsene Wenger is another manager getting an unacustomed level of negative press. Aston Villa is getting results and Friday's clawback for a 2-2 draw between the two teams was rough but earned.</p>
<p>His very young team has suffered from internal dissent epitomized by the stripping of the captaincy from William Gallas, injuries to key contributors Cesc Fabregas, Theo Walcott and Tomas Rosicky and an abundance of red cards and yet is still sitting fourth--for the moment, with Villa not playing until Tuesday.</p>
<p>The critics, though, say Wenger should have used the club's strong finances to add veteran depth as he looks for trophies at home and in Europe and that after 12 years in charge his arrogance is getting the better of his judgment. Luckily for him this is the off year for the biannual African Nations' Cup or he'd be digging deep into the reserve squad for bench bodies next month.</p>
<p>Sir Alex is probably sitting happy at home today after <span style="font-weight:bold;">Manchester United</span> shook off the transcontinental jet lag Friday to beat Stoke with a late goal and an extra day's rest before hosting strugglers Middlesboro tomorrow. Assuming the Red Devils win tomorrow, which is no sure thing this season for any of the Big Four, he gets two weeks with only Cup ties against Championship sides to rest up and prepare for the Jan. 11 collision with Scolari and Chelsea.</p>
<p>The club's two games in hand (against Wigan and Fulham) mean that a victory in that match leaves Ferguson's men sitting pretty to move up to second, a position he'll take any year when all his remaining games against the other teams in the top five places are at Old Trafford. Inter Milan in the first knockout stage are a big obstacle to a second consecutive Premier League/Champions League double but the gaffer was able to drive Jose Mourinho out of England.</p>
<p>The Reds will hope history is on their side as they hold on to their league lead going into 2009, with the top team as the calendar changes finishing top three of the last four years. For my dollars/pounds/Euros, Manchester United are the biggest threat to a Liverpool title but if Fernando Torres can stay healthy, Steven Gerrard stays strong and Rafa Benitez has his usual strong results in the winter transfer window <span style="font-weight:bold;">I believe the Reds will rule</span>.</p>
