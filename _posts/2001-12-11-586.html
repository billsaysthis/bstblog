<p><strong>BST Update: Stock page</strong></p>
<p>With time on my hands, I added the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/misc/stockquotes.phtml">Selected Stock Quotes</a> page to BillSaysThis. Based on code from Christopher Heschong's <a href="http://pecos.screwdriver.net/">Pecos</a> content management framework, the page shows several bits of information for an assortment of stocks as well as linking to the relevant Yahoo! Finance page. The exercise did give me a little bit more insight into PHP's array handling mechanism as well. If there's a stock you'd like to see added to the list, just <a href="mailto:bill@billsaysthis.com">let me know</a>.</p>
