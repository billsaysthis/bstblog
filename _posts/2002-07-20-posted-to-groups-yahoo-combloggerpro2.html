<br />Subject: [bloggerPro2] Been fun serving you all</p>
<p>&gt; just to echo another poster's comments, bill, i'm beyond impressed<br />
<br />&gt; with the support you provide here.</p>
<p>Everyone,</p>
<p>I'd like to take some of your inbox space to say that the last six weeks have been interesting and fun for me. Even when things got frustrating, such as the missing archives and templates, I was happy that I could be a hand in getting Blogger back and functioning. I truly appreciate the kind words from Dave and the rest of you.</p>
<p>However, all good things must come to an end, and so it is with my short adventure as a part of Pyra. I jumped into fill an unexpected hole but circumstances aren't right for me to stay on as part of the permanent staff. Ev or Jason will need to speak about their plans for support going forward but I'm confident they'll have good ones. And that the Blogger service will be better and stronger very soon--I peeked behind the curtain--so please keep that in mind.</p>
<p>I'll still be using BloggerPro and will answer questions that don't require me to access the secret databases because I believe in the community.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this also means I'm free to accept other work, not to mention that my checkbook software (no, it's not a BillSaysThis blog!) says I have to get busy, so if you know of a good position for a well-regarded tech support or product manager please let me know. My blog (and resume) are online at http://www.billsaysthis.com.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
<br />Bill L.</p>
