<p>All the headlines today are trying to convince us that the resignations of Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and White House Economic Advisory Lawrence Lindsay were big shocks. But if that's true, how come I saw Larry Kudlow on CNBC this morning claiming that the White House was canvassing for potential replacements over a month ago? Second, the post-election timing seems just a bit too convenient as Rove et al try to line up their ducks before Congress convenes and a huge new tax cut package is proposed.</p>
