<p><b>Tonight's movie: Osmosis Jones</b><br />

<p>It's gross! It's funny! It's inside Bill Murray! It's <a href="http://osmosisjones.warnerbros.com/#">Osmosis Jones</a>, the latest movie from Peter and Bobby Farrelly (the brothers gave us <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/movie-1098134/">Me, Myself &amp; Irene</a>, <a href="http://www.joblo.com/theresomethingaboutmary.htm">There's Something About Mary</a>, and <a href="http://www.jimcarreyonline.com/movies/dumbndumber.html">Dumb &amp; Dumber</a>). We go for a wild animated ride inside Bill Murray's insides, led by Chris Rock and David Hyde-Pierce as coppers chasing Lawrence Fishburne's deadly virus, not to mention <a href="http://www.williamshatner.com/">William Shatner's</a> weasly mayor of the City of Frank. Cool but not for the really young.</p>
<p>SciFi Weekly weighs in with <a href="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/current/screen.html">their review</a>--only a C+. I'd give it a B+.</p>
