<p><b>Last night's movie: Dr. Dolittle 2</b><br />

<p>Uh, don't bother the beaver. The godbeaver. Yeah, Eddie's talking to the animals again and they're <a href="http://www.drdolittle2.com/hq/index.html">getting organized</a>. Much better than his <a href="http://www.klumps.com/globalnav/gnf.pl?url=http%3A//www.klumps.com/&amp;referrer=http%3A//us.imdb.com/TUrls%3FOFF+0144528">other remake series</a>, Dolittle gives Murphy a good range of other characters to play against--his wife, both daughters but especially Raven Simone, Archie the Bear, some mafioso small mammals and rodents, and the ever-nasty Jeffrey Jones (who's bloated up quite a bit) supported by Kevin Pollack (who seems to take any role offered to him). Director Steve Carr, who previously directed the fun Ice Cube movie <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0195945">Next Friday</a> and a bunch of rap music videos and commercials, mainly steps back and let Eddie rule here.</p>
<p>p.s. Murphy is currently working on a buddy cop comedy with Robert DeNiro for release next year called <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0284490">Showtime</a>.</p>
