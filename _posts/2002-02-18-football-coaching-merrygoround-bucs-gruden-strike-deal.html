<p>Details are thin at the moment but the Associated Press is reporting a <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2002/0218/1335853.html">stunner in Tampa Bay</a>: the Buccaneers have signed Raiders coach Jon Gruden to a five year deal. The Glazer brothers met yesterday with 49ers coach Steve Mariucci but were unable to make a deal; money probably wasn't the sticking point since the rumors pegged the offer as seven years at $6 million per year, more than anyone else in the league is getting. Apparently, Mooch really doesn't want to move his family out of their showcase Los Gatos home because the local paper (the unlinkable SJ Merc) has run a number of articles showing that the 49ers executives aren't all that sad at the prospect of losing him. For example, they won't give him an extension on a contract that only pays $2 million a year. I know that sounds like a lot but not when Spurrier is now getting $5 million and Mike Holmgren $4 million. This ought to be an interesting off-season in the Bay Area. Next question: who will replace Gruden? And is Gruden also being named general manager, freeing Rich McKay to go to Atlanta?</p>
<p><em>Noon Update:</em> ESPN TV is reporting that the Gruden deal is for $17.5 million total, $3.5 million per year, and he will be the coach only. Still, Rich McKay is seriously unhappy at the way he was treated during this coaching search and wants out. Will the Glazers heal the illwill and let him leave without a fuss? Merrill Hoge thinks Gruden is a <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/columns/hoge_merrill/1335885.html">brilliant choice</a> who will be able to adapt his offensive scheme to the strengths of his players. Look for an offense that is mainly smash mouth (with those two great RBs) and knows how to stretch the field (calling Keyshawn).</p>
<p><em>12:30 update:</em> Compensation - the Raiders will receive first- and second-round draft picks in 2002, a first-round pick in 2003, and a second-round pick in 2004, no cash or players. Merrill Hoge thinks Gruden is a <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/columns/hoge_merrill/1335885.html">brilliant choice</a> who will be able to adapt his offensive scheme to the strengths of his players.
