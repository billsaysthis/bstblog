<p><b>Evolution coming to microchips?</b>
<p>Adrian Thompson at the University of Sussex in England has developed <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/monday/business/Story/419010p-414835c.html">computers that improve themselves</a> by coupling evolutionary algorithms and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs are microchips whose functionality can be varied by software, as opposed to, say, a dedicated chip like an Intel CPU on which all the functions are hardwired). More cool stuff!</p>
