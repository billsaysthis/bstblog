<p>If one is a volunteer in the US Military, how is that one's term of service can be involuntarily extended? Of course exigent circumstances and a vital service <a href="http://jrobb.mindplex.org/2004/06/02.html#a4827">may intrude</a> on an ideal but I think that servicemen and women should be released if they are no longer willing participants. Let Cheney and Rumsfeld get their cannon fodder elsewhere.</p>
<p>Less international significance but more pleasant to read, a reminder that <a href="http://blogs.officezealot.com/spiller">Melanie Spiller blogs wonderfully</a> on the art of technical (non-fiction) writing.</p>
<p>Scoble's geek dinners are great, if not quite legendary, but I am sorry to be missing <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/06/02.html#a7665">this one in NYC</a> by 10 days.</p>
<p>I do love <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/archivalimages/chevypink.jpg">Garret's</a> <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/archivalimages/chevypink.jpg">pretty</a> <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/archivalimages/paintbrush.jpg">pictures</a>!</p>
<p>In the Small World department, I found out that my new CEO is very close friends with my old CEO, so close that their families vacation together. Can't hurt, eh?</p>
<p>Lasty and in no way least, the US rocked Honduras in warm-up match for next week's World Cup 2006 qualifying round against Grenada. 4-0 Baby!</p>
