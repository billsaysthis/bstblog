<p>You know Tom DeLay is facing a pretty big problem when Republican mouthpiece David Brooks starts pointing out the chinks in DeLay's armor as he does in today's columns, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/20/opinion/20brooks.html?ex=1258693200&amp;en=4b3ea8ca62871697&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">A Scandal Waiting to Happen</a>. Even if Brooks does take extreme care to portray DeLay otherwise as positively as he can and the essay is more about why the Texas exterminator ought to go before he screws up the almost at hand conservative Nirvana.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Republicans in Congress aren't even willing to wait for the newly-elected members to show up in January before beginning the legislative assault that will implement their sad social agenda. Last night, the leadership inserted language <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/20/politics/20spend.html?ex=1258606800&amp;amp;en=8344f574696b0e26&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">further constraining abortion rights</a> into a completely unrelated spending bill that must be passed before midnight tonight to prevent a government shutdown. Despite plans by Senator Barbara Boxer to try and prevent passage, apparently this will slide through like the greased pig it so clearly resembles.</p>
<p>In a sign that Bush hasn't rid himself of all potential high level dissenting voices, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/20/business/20greenspan.html?ex=1258606800&amp;en=60757e4e72f4a125&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">raised alarms</a> in the investment world yesterday over the increasing Federal deficit, albeit indirectly by talking about the potential negative impact of the rapidly increasing U.S. current account deficit. That deficit is impacted by more than just federal spending, of course, but there is a fairly close connection.</p>
<p>And one wonders how much time is left (to Bush, to the Chinese, to anyone) to deal with the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/21/politics/21prexy.html?ex=1258693200&amp;en=d3cb634681485812&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">rising nuclear threats</a> from Iran and North Korea. American intelligence now estimate madman Kim Jong Il has at least six functional nuclear weapons and the Iranians, despite an agreement with European governments leading the effort to the contrary, are racing to complete the enrichment of at least some uranium hexaflouride, a gas that can be enriched into bomb fuel.</p>
