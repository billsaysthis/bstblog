<p>In the old days, news of a major release like <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/040930/sfth048a_1.html">Sun shipping a new version of Java</a> would get big, enthusiastic commentary all over the web. And though it's not like there's <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/09/30/1219234" title="And sure, most of the tech news sites will have a story">none</a>, I just don't feel the passion that accompanied the availability of, well, earlier releases of Java, Windows 3.1, Borland Delphi and so forth. Maybe the geeks are just a little burned out in this dotbomb era.</p>
