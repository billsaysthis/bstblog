<p>For those of you reading this through the feed, I wonder whether you have any strong feelings about this topic. Google <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/05/feed-me.html">has announced</a> they'll now allow AdSense publishers to include the ads in feeds and since I run the ads on the web pages from which these entries come seems reasonable to use them here too. Would you unsubscribe, not care at all, or occasionally, if an ad was for something useful to you at that moment, click them? The current ads hardly pull in any money, maybe enough to cover the hosting fees for the site, maybe a little less, not that I'm complaining, but no point in not taking advantage of an opportunity if the consequences are low.</p>
<p>Want to <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/contact.phtml?sub=RSS%20Ads">let me know</a> how you feel?</p>
