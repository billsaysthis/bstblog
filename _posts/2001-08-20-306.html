<p><b>D'oh! Not again!</b><br />

<p>Am I going to lose my <a href="http://www.business2.com/articles/web/0,1653,15637,FF.html?ref=cnet" title="Northpoint was the first">second high speed Internet Service Provider</a> this year? Maybe, because C|Net is reporting that <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1004-200-6928152.html?tag=mn_hd">Excite@Home survival chances dim</a>. Damn! My main option if this happens is Pac Bell and they've already tried twice to install their service here without succeeding. D'oh!</p>
