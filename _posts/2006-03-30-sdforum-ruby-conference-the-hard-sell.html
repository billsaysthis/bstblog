<p>[<em>Cross-posted from <a href="http://www.wgrosso.com/weblog/?p=119">Bill Grosso's blog</a></em>]</p>
<p>SDForum is putting on a <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1871">Ruby conference on April 22-23</a>. It's currently priced at $199 (for both days), and for that you get:
<ul>
<li>An overview of Rails 1.1 from one of the people at <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/">37Signals</a>.</li>
<li>A talk on scalability from the CTO of <a href="http://www.joyent.com/">Joyent</a> (who run, among other things, <a href="http://www.textdrive.com/">TextDrive</a>, the official hosting site of Ruby on Rails).</li>
<li>10 other insanely great talks</li>
<li>Two breakfasts</li>
<li>Two lunches</li>
<li>A t-shirt (if you sign up before we order them)</li>
</ul>
<p>When you consider that other Ruby events are going for $500 or more, we're quite the bargain. So, sign up already. And get the free t-shirt.</p>
<p>[I'll be one of the gray-shirted volunteers.]</p>
