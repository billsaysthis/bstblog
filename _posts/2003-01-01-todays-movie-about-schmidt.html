<p>Byron called mid-afternoon and asked if we were interested in seeing the much talked-about Nicholson flick. Sure, what the heck, it was either this or the Tennessee-Maryland matchup in the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=223652633">Peach Bowl</a>. And as I walk in the door, the score is 27-3 Terps, so who cares about missing that. Thursday, with my Trojans up against Iowa, that will not be missed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aboutschmidtmovie.com/">About Schmidt</a> is a terrific movie and if Jack Nicholson doesn't win the Oscar, some people made a big mistake. Using the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Golden_Globes_USA/2003">Golden Globe nominees</a> as a proxy, one is hardpressed to see him lose to this competition. His decision to take this role follows a recent trend for big name actors to play against type (<a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_11_03_blog_archive.phtml#85644508">Robin Williams</a>, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_07_14_blog_archive.phtml#85266117">Tom Hanks</a>) and, as with those two, <em>Schmidt</em> shows just how good an actor Nicholson truly is. As my buddy point, a very layered acting job where much of the communication comes through subtle body language.</p>
<p>I would also give kudos to writer/director Alexander Payne (<i>Election</i>, <i>Citizen Ruth</i>) for an outstanding job; this movie is very real, so very un-Hollywood, and most filmmakers wouldn't be able to make a gripping movie about real life. Plus, the trailer for the film doesn't give away all the best lines or really give away the point like so many others do. Very deliberate choices in shot selection and visual composition, very calm and deliberate pacing. And one aspect which I took to be just a plot device to enable exposition turned out to be crucial to the final twist and resolution.</p>
<p><em>A Must See</em></p>
