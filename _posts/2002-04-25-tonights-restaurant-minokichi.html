<p>Sitting just about at the western end of downtown Palo Alto's University Ave., this Japanese restaurant features an all you can stuff down your gullet buffet. I did a Google search and found nothing useful to link here (there is a <a href="http://www.takeoutfoodservice.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=SC.ProductList&amp;storeID=74">menu from a takeout service</a> but not only can't you get the buffet to go, not everything on the takeout menu is on the buffet). Still, Minokichi is definitely worth a visit if you have a decent appetite: the charge is only $9.95 for lunch and $12.95 dinner Tuesday-Thursday, $15.95 dinner Friday to Sunday (the place is closed Mondays).</p>
<p>The buffet features a nice but not huge assortment of sushi, fairly light on the rolls other than cucumber, futumaki, California, and one with roe, regular (American style) salad, a couple of Japanese cold salads, two kinds of soup (to be honest I didn't care for the too-bland miso), several tempuras, a very tasty ginger calamari, beef and chicken teriyaki, sauteed oysters, some steamed and sauteed greens, shrimp foo young, spareribs, rice, french fries, and several desserts. We dined early, right after the dinner service started at 5:30, and there were plenty of empty tables. Lunch time, according to the host, features fewer items on the buffet but I'll probably try it out in a couple of weeks and report back. The quality of fish was good, the quantity was terrific, and I'd definitely rate this as a good value for your sushi dollar.</p>
