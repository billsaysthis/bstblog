<p>Last year I saw a pre-movie slide ad at Century 16 here in Mountain View placed by an individual on behalf of his consulting business. I contacted him to see what the results where but apparently mine was the only communication he got for his $300. Driving up 101 to San Mateo yesterday (where we saw <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_07_06_blog_archive.phtml#105807061730101335">League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a> at the very nice new Century 12 Downtown), I saw a billboard for a service that promised to help increase one's skill with photography.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.phototrainer.com/">PhotoTrainer.com</a> was the site and it turns out to be a personal or small group instructional service offered by one man, Tom Upton, "a veteran professional Photographer and Photoillustrator located in Menlo Park." Mr. Upton charges $100 per hour, bascially, for his tutorial services. I wish him only the best but wonder how much that billboard cost him and how he can possibly get enough business from it to justify the expenditure. Or is there some fact I'm missing, some connection perhaps, that means he's not paying what you or I would for this advertising. Interesting either way.</p>
<p>On my personal efforts, there is nothing to report--not a single contact regarding the purchase of <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/telecaster/">my guitar and amp</a> nor my fliers advertising <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_06_29_blog_archive.phtml#105710042619666006">blogging classes</a>. So much for my credentials for asking this question...</p>
