<p>You know I love the egoboo! The non-virtual Indian newspaper Hindustan Times' New Economy column <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/neweconomy/quite45.shtml">QuiteATake</a> linked to <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_01_27_blog_archive.phtml">my February post</a> on the Nigerian email scam back in March although today was the first time anyone clicked over to my site. Nice to see BillSaysThis get picked up and mentioned globally and professionally!</p>
