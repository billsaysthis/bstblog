<p>Strange how it is that in PHP class methods cannot call independent functions which instantiate a member of the class and then try and call that method, which tries to call the independent function, and so forth. Guess this is that rabbit hole and PHP is tuned not to let you fall in. But the runtime engine also does not throw an error that would lead you to this answer either. <em>Yummy!</em></p>
