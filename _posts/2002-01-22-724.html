<p><strong>Liverpool at Manchester United: Lovely 1-0</strong></p>
<p>Amazing match, all defense with many challenges by Man United until Murphy took a lovely leading pass from Gerrard at 84:20 and just got his toe on the ball to push it around a defender and over goalkeeper Barthez for the score. Just a beautiful play! The Manchester home crowd at Old Trafford was loud and partisan throughout. But the Reds beat their rivals for the fifth consecutive time and rose above the murk of recent results that had them falling from first in the Premiership to fifth. Danny Murphy has been <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/england/news/2002/0122/20020122lfcmurphy.html">on the edge</a> lately but put in a fine showing with the game's only goal. Next up is a tough away FA Cup match at Arsenal, who sit one point behind Liverpool in the league table, on Sunday.</p>
