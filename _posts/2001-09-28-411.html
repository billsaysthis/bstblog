<p><b>Young Intelligent Hackers Against Terror</b></p>
<p>A group of U.K. techies does some freelance anti-terrorism work: <a href="http://www.newsbytes.com/news/01/170588.html">Sudan Bank Hacked, Bin Laden Info Found</a>. This is according to a German businessman and teen hacking prodigy named <a href="http://www.kimble.org/">Kim Schmitz</a> who claims the information has been supplied to the FBI. The FBI and other government offices have no comment, of course. Schmitz also notified the Sudanese bank. I have to wonder, though, why he is publicizing this now (other than for the obvious personal publicity reasons) since letting the opposition know of the success only helps them and does us no service.</p>
