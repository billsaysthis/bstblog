<p><b>This kind of thing won't help Sun</b></p>
<p>Blatantly biased (note the "Prepared for Sun Microsystems" right at the top) whitepapers like <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/resources/articles/J2EE-vs-DOTNET/article.html">J2EE vs. Microsoft.NET</a> by Chad Vawter and Ed Roman of The Middleware Company will not be swallowed whole by developers. Even with 'promises' like "We promise to compare these choices at a logical, neutral, and unbiased level." Bought and paid for analysis is usually worth a lot less than it costs.</p>
