<p>Today is a wonderful day, for reasons stated voluminously elsewhere. I do not think our new President can work miracles any more than I believe in Santa Claus but he can do good and will in ways that neither GWB, Dick Cheney nor John McCain would consider.</p>
<p>Speaking of McCain, man did we dodge a bullet! His potential presidency was looking more and more like a third term for the current criminal crew. With the added bonus of biting our nails to the quick over the prospect that he would be in some way incapacitated, thus putting a former TV weather girl in charge of our nation.</p>
<p>My prediction is that Obama will have serious difficulties dealing with the ongoing adjustment to globalization of which the trouble with Al Qaeda and the economic quagmire are but two manifestations.</p>
<p>As pointed out to me by self-described conservative friends, we liberals tend to get stuck in on decisions because we try to account for every point of view (see appointments of Clinton, Hilary, and Gates, Robert). While I tend to see this as a strength, since the decisions made are stronger--for all its good and bad, the United Nations on whole is still a useful organization that would never have been founded by a (modern) Republican administration--such a process will not produce the immediate results some fantasists forecast after the elections.</p>
<p>We are, once again and most happily, on the Freedom Highway. The destination is many mile markers down the road.</p>
