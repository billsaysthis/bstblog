<p><a href="http://www.iusedtobelieve.com/home.php">i used to believe</a> "is a collection of ideas that adults thought were true when they were children." Visitors are encouraged to add personal memories to the collection. A cute idea. [<em>via <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/">garret</a></em>]</p>
<p>My contribution:</p>
<p>When I was about five, and already a bit of a science fiction fan, my uncle told me that Jews were really Martians and that our family's space ship was in a cave underneath his garage. His house was on a hill, so the explanation seemed perfectly reasonable.</p>
<p>He promised that once I passed my Bar Mitzvah, he could show me the ship and teach me to fly it. Sadly, he passed away when I was about seven and so I never got to see his spaceship.</p>
<p>Now, our family is Jewish, so my uncle was putting me on in a good natured way, he was a total kidder, and this is in no way meant to be anti-Semitic.</p>
