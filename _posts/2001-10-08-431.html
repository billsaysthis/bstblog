<p><b>Quick look at the major Islamic countries</b></p>
<p>TechnoPolitics, a website from the producers of the now off the air PBS TV series of the same name, has some interesting articles and other information. Of much current relevance is this two parter that takes a <a href="http://www.technopolitics.com/latest9-19.html">quick look&lt;/a. (part one) at the major <a href="http://www.technopolitics.com/latest9-25.html">Islamic countries</a> (part two). Also of interest is their <a href="http://www.technopolitics.com/database.html">TP Database</a>, a set of statistical questions and answers covering a wide range of topics, although it would be nice to get a better explanation of their information sources.</a></p>
