<p>Following on <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_06_23_blog_archive.phtml#85197466">yesterday's post</a> about the coming Springsteen release, BillSaysThis is proud to bring you the first trailer for <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/star_trek_nemesis/large.html">Star Trek: Nemesis</a>. Or at least give you a link to it, let's not get all bigheaded over three friend's links. Now in all honesty I will admit to being a major Trek fan, watching the TV shows, even reading many of the novels. Still, the trailer looks awesome, the Remans look like they can kick serious behind, and December 13 can't come soon enough!</p>
<p>Just what the heck do they mean by "A Generation's Final Journey...Begins"? Trek maestro Rick Berman <a href="http://talk.trekweb.com/articles/2002/06/26/1025115734.html">says</a> "I think that to say there won't be another movie is silly," he says straight out. "There will be STAR TREK movies for a long time -- whether they are going to be NEXT GENERATION movies or movies based on other series or ENTERPRISE or movies based on brand new characters, I just don't know."</p>
