<p>Do you eat fruits like bananas, pineapples, mangoes, or oranges? Guess what? Any of them that come into this area on boats will be going up in price by serious amounts starting tomorrow and continuing as long as the ports are shut down. At the market today, the manager told the person in front of me in line that the cost of bananas will go from $11 per case to about $30. Good thing bananas are not allowed on Atkins!</p>
