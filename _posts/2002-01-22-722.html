<p><strong>Tonight's movie: Gone in 60 Seconds</strong></p>
<p>Vroom vroom! Fast cars, a sexy woman, and some inexplicable explosions generate the heat in <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/movie-1097865/about.php">Gone in 60 Seconds</a>. Nicholas Cage plays a reformed auto thief who gets pulled back in against his will (how else can we be sympathetic?) when his younger brother (slimy Giovanni Ribisi) gets in a mess with a psychopathic Englishman (Christopher Eccleston). Robert Duvall plays his also-retired mentor, <a href="http://www.allposters.com/gallery.asp?aid=15282&amp;item=307818">Angelina Jolie</a> is his pissed off but still, under it all, in love girlfriend, and Ving Rhames is a cop who can never catch Cage even when he has him under a gun. This moronic movie can be enjoyed if you ignore the script and just drool over all the classic sports cars that get ripped off.</p>
