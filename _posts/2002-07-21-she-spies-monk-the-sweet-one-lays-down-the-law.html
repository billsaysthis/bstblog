<p>As she <a href="http://www.billsaysthis/vivroar/archives/2002_07_21_archive.html#85269022">says in her weblog</a>, this new show on NBC sucks. The girls are gorgeous, no doubt, but the writers were going for a kind of whacky Austin Powers meets La Femme Nikita thing, with a little Candid Camera thrown in, and didn't come close pulling it off.</p>
<p>The Sweet One said to me, "Even <a href="http://www.usanetwork.com/series/monk/">Monk</a> is better!" and I agree. We've watched the pilot and the first regular episode of this new Tony Shalhoub series and are liking it. Think Felix Unger to the modern extreme as a brilliant police detective. Bitty Schram plays his nurse and has to keep him from giving in to his neuroses and keep other people from tossing him in an institution. Plus, it's set in San Francisco and environs. This is pretty original so far and if the writers can keep this going can be a big hit.</p>
