<p>Took me a few years and the urging of <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/vivroar/blogger.html">The Sweet One</a> to finally catch up with this quirky German production. <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/runlolarun/">Run Lola Run</a> stars Franka Potente and Moritz Bleibtreu as pait of young lovers caught up in circumstances threatening him with death at the hands of his ruthless drug dealer boss. They have 20 minutes to come up with 100,000 Deusche Marks that he was to deliver but lost.</p>
<p>Director Tom Tykwer has Potenta (Bourne Identity) literally running for Bleibtreu's life. Three times he retells those 20 crucial minutes, from the phone call from him to her explaining until the scenario runs out. Though the starting point, with Potente hanging up the phone and racing out of her apartment, is the same, each runthrough quickly takes a different turn. Lola's father is featured in a short subplot and gives Tykwer a strong mirror story. He's involved with a woman at work and his results more or less reverse Lola's. As the director himself explains: "It is this woman's passion alone that brings down the rigid rules and regulations of the world surrounding her. Love can move mountains, and does. Over and above all the action, the central driving force of this film is romance."</p>
<p>Like most movies, this one has <a href="http://www.haro-online.com/movies/run_lola_run.html">fans</a> willing to be <a href="http://www8.brinkster.com/grifgirl/runlolarun/">more enthusiastic and detailed</a> than me.</p>
