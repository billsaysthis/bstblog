<p>Bruce,</p>
<p>I've been a fan since 1975, since I spent the summer with nothing but Born to Run on my bedroom turntable. Thanks for all the incredible music over the years. I've also been glad that you've mostly stayed out of commenting on politics and letting your actions speak for themselves. Not being one to write adoring fan letters but to let my actions (purchasing recordings, concert tickets, sheet music, and so forth) similar speak. I believe, and I hope you agree, that with the introduction this week in the US Senate of the Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act by Fritz Hollings a new issue has become significant enough to you and your fans that you will choose to use what influence is available to you to defeat this horrible legislation. I assume that I need not waste your time explaining why I call this horrible legislation and why I have chosen to finally write.</p>
<p>Personally, I will do what I can, writing to my senators and representatives, urging family and friends to do the same, and posting such sentiments to my own website. I've never seen you really just come out and, say, issue press releases condemning this or that but I am sure there are appropriate tools and channels for you to use if that is your desire. Your record company, for instance, has to be torn between its IP-generating music and film divisions and its consumer electronics/PC groups over how to proceed and your voice might help executives make the right choice. Similarly, I'm sure the elected officials from New Jersey would take your calls.</p>
<p>I hope your fans will triumph in the end on this issue. I hope you will see fit to add your efforts.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
<br />Bill Lazar</p>
