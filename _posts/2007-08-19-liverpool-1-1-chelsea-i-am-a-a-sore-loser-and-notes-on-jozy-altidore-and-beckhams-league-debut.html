<p>Yeah, it was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/6941876.stm">a draw at Anfield today</a> in the Primary Colors derby but the visitor score came from a farcical decision by referee Rob "I love my pretty color cards" Styles and from my couch Liverpool were 'rob'ed on an afternoon when the Reds debuted a hard-edged playing style to the home fans.</p>
<p>Styles awarded the Blues a penalty in the 62nd minute after Jamie Carragher (in his eyes) abusively blocked Florent Malouda as the winger ran across the top of the 18 yard box chasing the ball. Even without replays the decision was questionable as Malouda had no chance to catch up to the ball ahead of other players but video shows that there was no contact between him and Carra.</p>
<p>Rafa Benitez was about as strong in his post-match comments on the horrible PK decision as allowable considering the potential repercussions: "It's difficult to explain such a decision - maybe the referee was under a bit of pressure," <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/6954211.stm">said Benitez</a>. "I think he will watch the video of the match and admit that his penalty decision was a mistake."</p>
<p>The match was filled with questionable decisions and yellow cards throughout but this was beyond a simple mistake, and combined with previous gaffes like last week's red card to Dave Kitson 45 seconds after the Reading man came on as a sub is enough that the FA should review Styles' continued participation as top official for Premiership games.</p>
<p>Still, coming away from this week's three matches with two wins and a draw, combined with Manchester United's terrible start (one goal in two draws and a loss), is a great start. There are several breaks for international play over the next six weeks and a very favorable schedule (at Sunderland, home leg of the Champions League tie with Toulouse, home to Derby, away to Portsmouth, home to Birmingham and away at Wigan) so the Reds could be sitting very pretty on October 1, whereas last season the league title was already out of reach.</p>
<p>Sir Alex Ferguson all of a sudden is facing a real mountain to win a tenth EPL title, by the way, with Wayne Rooney out until October or November and the $100 million-plus in Summer signings have so far been of minimal help. Seven points is a lot to make up though it helps that deficit is only five points to Chelsea and neither Liverpool nor Arsenal drove home the advantage of a game in hand.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Update, a day later:</span> Guess I'm not such a sore loser. Styles will be sitting out the next game day as <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/6954211.stm">punishment for his terrible performance</a>. Referees' chief Keith Hackett told BBC Radio: "It is just like with players, if they miss an open goal they are likely to be dropped."</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Beckham's MLS Debut</span></p>
<p>I was surprised to learn that Landon Donovan had turned over the captain's armband to Mr. 23 and didn't see substantial evidence of his leadership on the field, making me wonder if this was yet another PR move. That's not to say he didn't have a big impact on the game, he very much did with three assists on the four Galaxy goals and went the full 90 despite showing real signs of wear after 60 or 65 minutes.</p>
<p>But the score line shows how badly LA needed their new captain the whole way. After starting two transplanted midfielders to prop up a depleted defense their right back was lost to injury in the 17th minute and coach Frank Yallop's experimental move of MF Kevin Harmes to the backline left the visitors far too exposed. Further, after a very strong start, Beckham flopped on his second half  free kicks, slamming four in a row straight into the wall.</p>
<p>A very bright note for the USA National Team was Jozy Altidore's two goals in the match. The 17 year old, who grew up in my hometown of Livingston, NJ, will hopefully get some serious consideration from coach Bob Bradley for the September 9 match against Brazil and the two October ties in Europe.</p>
<p>There was much talk last month Altidore moving to a European club but he isn't eligible to move until after his birthday in November; if he scores a few more goals in MLS (seven so far this season) and, hopefully, a few quality minutes coming on as a sub against Catalonia and/or Switzerland, Jozy could <a href="http://njmg.typepad.com/sbi/2007/08/red-bulls-toppl.html">command a record transfer price</a> in January to a team in, say, Spain or The Netherlands who need just a little bit extra for the second half run.</p>
