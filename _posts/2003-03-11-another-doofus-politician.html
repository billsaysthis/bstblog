<p>Should a congressperson resign after saying things that are out and out anti-Semitic? "If it were not for the strong support of the Jewish community for this war with Iraq, we would not be doing this. The leaders of the Jewish community are influential enough that they could change the direction of where this is going, and I think they should." According to Marc Fisher, writing in the Washington Post, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A8092-2003Mar10.html">Sorry, Mr. Moran, You're Not Fit For Public Office</a>, the answer is yes. Apparently <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A5887-2003Mar10.html">this is not</a> his first really <a href="http://windsofchange.net/archives/003167.html">outrageous act</a>. Get this moron out of our government!</p>
