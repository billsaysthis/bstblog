<p><b>George Carlin is a funny man</b>
<p>Call him Mr. Cranky, but <a href="http://www.georgecarlin.com/georgecarlin/home/home.html" title="His official site">George Carlin</a> is a funny guy. And now he has a website with his name on it that even has (a little) original content, such as That Time of the Month--this month's snippet is about terrorists and the White House. He is also a founding partner of <a href="laugh.com">Laugh.com</a>, which I haven't looked at yet. In case the home page seems kind of slim, put your mouse over the blue dots on the top left corner of the page and it turns out to be a navigation menu; George, shame on you for poor design!</p>
<p>You could also check out some <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/misc/carlin_questions.phtml">Carlin humor</a> I've posted.</p>
