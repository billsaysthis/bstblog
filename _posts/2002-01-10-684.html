<p><strong>Must read Safire: Iran must be an anti-terror target</strong></p>
<p>William Safire has been a political pundit/NY Times columnist for nearly 30 years and my frequency of agreement with him varies from extremely low on domestic social issues to fairly high on foriegn policy. In his column in today's Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/10/opinion/10SAFI.html?todaysheadlines">Arafat's Implausible Denials</a>, I find that what he says is completely plausible and extremely important. The recent capture by Israel of a shipload of arms sold/provided by Iran to the Palestinians shows that the ayatollahs in Iran are still sponsors of terrorism and must be dealt with, eventually, the same as the Taliban and Saddam Hussein.</p>
