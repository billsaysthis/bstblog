<p>Society's conventions draw lines in the air<br />
<br />Grains of sand that shift from side to side<br />
<br />As moments pass and what has happened<br />
<br />Collides with what was chosen and what<br />
<br />Was said.</p>
<p>Do unto others as, no doubt, but when so<br />
<br />Many of us choose to ignore such wisdom<br />
<br />Can there truly be anything that resembles<br />
<br />Convention or is this figure of speech simply<br />
<br />Common illusion?</p>
<p>Leading writers, or intellectuals, or pundits,<br />
<br />Point to logic and suggest a life driven by<br />
<br />Consistent principles--if a, then b, resulting<br />
<br />In happiness--though one may easily survey<br />
<br />Other results.</p>
<p>Sanctity of life or purity of experience, one<br />
<br />Extreme to another, yet set a kettle to boil<br />
<br />Steam still rises and a whistle proclaims the<br />
<br />Pressure under which many, simple or complex,<br />
<br />Finally crumble.</p>
<p>The youngest children often ask questions<br />
<br />Dismissed as unanswerable, irrelevant, trite<br />
<br />When a parent or teacher finds the truth<br />
<br />Painful to express, exposing the illogic,<br />
<br />Ungirding faith.</p>
