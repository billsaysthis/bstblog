<p><b>Time for fun in the Sun</b>
<p>Yesterday, my bosses at Sun announced a <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-5722569.html?tag=mn_hd">mandatory vacation</a> for the first week of July for all employees. I haven't seen the email yet but I understand that you either take some accrued time off or take the days unpaid, but one way or the other you take the days off. This will help quite a few people, who will maybe remember there is life in other places than their office, whether they like it or not. I suppose it doesn't effect me since I'm still on leave then. Anyway, this is a nice money saver that shouldn't hit anyone too hard and has been used by quite a few other companies, such as HP, before.</p>
