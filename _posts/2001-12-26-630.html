<p><strong>Fixing this laptop</strong></p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.sodablue.com/About.htm">kind stranger</a> was considerate enough to respond to my <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_12_16_blog_archive.phtml#8112670">previous lament</a> about the instability of my Sony VAIO laptop with a few suggestions, the most basic being to look for updated BIOS or other drivers. Which of course I found straight out once I went to Sony's support site. Why I, as a registered user, wasn't informed of the availability of an update is beyond me. So now we'll see what happens. If the problems continue I go to the next suggestion. Thanks for the kindness of the Internet stranger.</p>
