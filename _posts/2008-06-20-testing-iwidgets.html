<p>A friend from those long-ago NetDynamics days has a new company that just came into public beta called <a href="http://iWidgets.com">iWidgets</a> that provides a fairly simple to use, JavaScript-based tool to build a wide variety of widgets which you can then deploy on Social Networks like Facebook and Hi5, widget portals like iGoogle and embed on your blog.</p>
<p>As a test I made a simple widget that should show the most recent five headlines from the movie review blog and here it is:</p>
<p>Seems blank so far, but this is an early beta ;)</p>
