<p><strong>Tonight's movie: Legally Blonde</strong></p>
<p>Sporting an amazing 40 different hair styles, Reese Witherspoon takes a sweet, silly ride through an adventure in love in <a href="http://www.legallyblonde.com/">Legally Blonde</a>. If you don't look close enough, the film looks like another college-targeted romantic comedy but it really is a satire of those films. Director Robert Luketic (yea, who's he? The only prior credit is having written and directed something in Australia called Titsiana Booberini) pushes way past the bounds of reality early and often, although that might be more attributed to writers Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (they previously co-wrote <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_09_30_blog_archive.phtml#6015074">10 Things I Hate About You</a>) or novelist Amanda Brown. One dissapointment was the relationship between Witherspoon and Luke Wilson; they never get a chance to go anywhere with it so the director needs to use those goofy end of flick where they go captions to wrap it up. Victor Garber, who's <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/alias/profiles/sd6bristowj01.html">popping up a lot</a> these days, has a nice, decently developed role as her professor/mentor.</p>
