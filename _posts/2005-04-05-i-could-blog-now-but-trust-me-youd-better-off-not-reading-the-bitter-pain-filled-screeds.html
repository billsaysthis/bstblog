<p>Scamming new parents for permission to spam in the last minutes before childbirth. Staffing levels at pharmacies that make customers scream and workers cry. Political wolves treading on the spines of hypnotized, anestheized, nearly euthanized sheep. Absurd toilet cleaning products that prove beyond a reasonable doubt that our consumerism and corporatism are converging somewhere near the seventh ring of Hell.</p>
<p>I think you see my point. Oddly enough, work is good and home life is pretty sweet.</p>
