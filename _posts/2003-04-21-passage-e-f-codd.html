<p>Hard to believe but <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?PHPSESSID=e84712a610cb69908b4deff32873de45&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=codd&amp;sort=">nobody</a> is blogging the <a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/5676110.htm" title="Sorry for the quick expiring Mercury News link but that's literally the only mention I could find!">death Friday</a> of database theory god Edgar Codd. You know, the guy who <a href="http://www.acm.org/classics/nov95/toc.html">invented relational theory</a> and all that jazz while he was hanging around IBM's Santa Theresa lab (right here in San Jose) because he was sickened by the crap that passed for organized storage back in the '70s. Hard to think of any creation in software so important since then, yet no one mentions him going. Sad.</p>
