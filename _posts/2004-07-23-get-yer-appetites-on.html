<p>It's been awhile since the last geek dinner in the area,&nbsp;the best we can remember it was&nbsp;the one <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001397.html">Jeremy Zadowny</a> organized when <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a> came down for a visit, and August is going to be a hot, slow month in the South Bay. So <a href="http://www.whump.com/morelikethis/">Bill Humphries</a> and I are sponsoring one in downtown Mountain View at 7:00 on Friday, August 13 at <a href="http://www.mountainviewca.net/restaurants/cafeyulong.html">Cafe Yulong</a> (on Dana Street between Hope and Castro). So if you're in the area, join us and even if you can't, do feel free to pass along the message to others. Since neither of us have comments on our blogs, you can <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/contact.phtml?sub=Aug13Dinner">write&nbsp;me directly</a>&nbsp;or send&nbsp;Bill a message through&nbsp;his <a href="http://www.whump.com/feedback.php">feedback link</a>&nbsp;to let us know you're coming; just be sure to put 'August 13 Dinner' in your message.</p>
