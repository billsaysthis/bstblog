<p>Finally broke down and got <a href="http://brucespringsteen.net/albums/magic.html">Magic</a> from iTunes last week, with five or so solid listens since. Bruce's latest isn't the immediate grabber, at least for me, that <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rising</span> was nor is it a hard rock record in the style of, say, <span style="font-style:italic;">Born to Run</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Darkness</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">Born in the USA</span>, and impression you have gotten from reading the rock critics' pontifications.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Magic</span> is a good record and it does rock but the connection I'd make is to the more R&amp;B style of his first two albums and the retro '60s sound spread among <span style="font-style:italic;">The River</span>'s two discs, updated for the time passed. Lyrically Bruce is continuing with his exploration of a political voice, most explicitly in <span style="font-style:italic;">Livin' in the Future</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Last to Die</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Long Walk Home</span> but most of the remaining have subtle messages if read in this light.</p>
<p><a href="http://release.theplatform.com/content.select?pid=v5TJDzU4ima1YcR5kPK570jhvIA7W_Qp&amp;UserName=Unknown">Radio Nowhere</a>, track one and the first single, is a bit deceptive in that sense, being the closest musically to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rising</span>; lyrically I still  think its too close to <span style="font-style:italic;">57 Channels</span> and Elvis Costello's <span style="font-style:italic;">Radio, Radio</span>, and a whole host of other songs over the years from artists who don't hear their own product often enough on mass media outlets.</p>
<p>Most of the remaining tracks struck me as Bruce mining the big studio sound of Phil Spector and Brian Wilson (<span style="font-style:italic;">Your Own Worst Enemy</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Girls in Their Summer Clothes</span>), with a definite influence from his recent folkie work (e.g., <span style="font-style:italic;">Gypsy Biker</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Magic</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Devil's Arcade</span>). <a href="http://release.theplatform.com/content.select?pid=HaK_bx2pXHmAu8uaPMNX6sAG1Pt_BqS1&amp;UserName=Unknown">I'll Work for Your Love</a> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Long Walk Home</span> are outliers, the former a straight ahead pop rocker that could easily be mistaken for one of the tunes on Disc 3 of <a href="http://brucespringsteen.net/albums/tracks.html">Tracks</a> and the latter almost veering, in a good way, into Neil Young/Pearl Jam musical territory.</p>
<p>Overall I slotted <span style="font-style:italic;">Magic</span> in eleventh in the <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/content/entertain/rating_bruce.php">Rating Bruce Records table</a>, just behind <span style="font-style:italic;">Tracks</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Live 1975-1985</span> and ahead of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nebraska</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle</span>.</p>
