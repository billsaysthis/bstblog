<p>145 comments so far in <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/26434">this thread</a> launched by an article regarding a prosecution under British law of a football fan who chanted a racial epithet at another fan during a match. Some very articulate (including a few from <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/26434#504962">myself</a>) and others not so. Of course you get into the whole cultural differences thing not to mention the difference between US and British laws on speech and the freedom thereof; no constitution or anything quite like our First Amendment there.</p>
<p>What interest me most about this is the concept of how different people try and draw lines between right and wrong. If I intimidate someone by using offensive language, some say, than that is wrong and the law ought to back the offended person up by penalizing my speech. Might push the less, err, thoughtful people who hear such things over the line into violence. Others (like me) reason that without free speech we'll quickly start circling the drain because such openings are always taken advantage of by someone looking for power or control.</p>
