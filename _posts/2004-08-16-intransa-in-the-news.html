<p><a href="http://www.intransa.com">Intransa Inc.</a>, an Internet protocol-based storage area network systems company where I just finished up a product management contract, has <a href="http://professional.venturewire.com/exclusives.asp?sid=IHLJNMMLOK">raised a $25 million Series D round</a> to take the company to profitability next year. The company was beginning to ramp up, with very strong distribution deals in the US, Europe and Asia when I left and hopefully this money will see them through to the Promised Land.</p>
<p>Also of interest, Dr. Avi Katz, Intransa's CEO, will be the speaker this Thursday night for the <a href="http://www.jhtc.org">JHTC</a>.<br /></p>
