<p>16 years have passed since we saw Michael Corleone foiled in his attempt to protect his family and get out of "this thing of ours." The years have been harsh to him, yet he is more powerful and feared than ever at the start of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0099674">Godfather: Part III</a>. The stakes have escalated as well; Michael's push for legitimacy has him donating hundreds of millions of dollars to a corrupt Catholic Church in exchange for their golden share in one of the world's largest real estate companies. But in this morality lesson, evil, no matter how well intentioned, cannot win in the end.</p>
<p>Critics have panned this last episode of the saga mercilessly since it was released in 1990 and I can't say I disagree with them. Director Coppola, on his DVD commentary track, even seems to disown responsibility and claims studio interference. His casting of daughter Sofia as Corleone daughter Mary was surely his own mistake, even if it was made out of love. I noticed on IMDB that this was essentially her only substantial acting role, although she did write and direct the acclaimed <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0159097">Virgin Suicides</a> in 1999.</p>
<p>Pacino is his usual brilliant self. Keaton is a non-entity onscreen although a recent Pacino biography claimed that the two were near marriage at the time in real life after being off and on lovers for decades. Andy Garcia is just a little too comic book-like as the bastard son of Sonny Corleone.</p>
<p>Not recommended.</p>
