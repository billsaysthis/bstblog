<p>All the world over, people decry American cultural domination. France, especially, since they make mostly crappy films and music these days. But look at today's development in Italy: <a href="http://worldcup.espnsoccernet.com/story?id=218235&amp;lang=us">RAI mulls filing lawsuit</a>. Here we have the Italian TV network getting out the lawyers to possibly sue FIFA (the governing body for world soccer) because bad referring lead to the claimed early exit of the Italian team from the World Cup, causing the network to potentially lose serious lira from lower viewership. Are the Italians being overly influenced by America's overwhelming dependence on lawyers to solve all problems?</p>
<p>FIFA president Sepp Blatter in an interview with an Italian newspaper said that Italy should stop being such bad losers.</p>
<p>And add this to your calculation: the South Korean player who scored the winning goal against Italy has been dropped from the Italian club for which he played because, according to the club's president, he betrayed Italian football. WTF? Was he supposed to not play his best for his country just because his club is in the country of his opponents?</p>
<p>I think you know the answer.</p>
