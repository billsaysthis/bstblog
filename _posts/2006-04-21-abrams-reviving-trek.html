<p><a href="http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=3&amp;id=35587">Sci Fi Wire -- Abrams Reviving Trek</a>: "Paramount has hired <span style="font-style:italic;">Mission: Impossible III</span> director J.J. Abrams to write, direct and produce the 11th Star Trek feature film, aiming for a 2008 release, Variety reported. It will center on the early days of original <i>Trek</i> characters James T. Kirk and Mr. Spock, including their first meeting at Starfleet Academy and first space mission, the trade paper reported."</p>
<p>Can I just say <span style="font-style:italic;">W00t!</span>? I can't explain why I've never got into Abrams current hit show <span style="font-style:italic;">Lost</span> though I've been an <span style="font-style:italic;">Alias</span> fan from episode 1. You might point out that the show I like features a hot fighting chick way out in front while the other is more of a male-dominated ensemble but Jennifer Garner, who is undoubtedly very pretty, just doesn't <a href="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/granitz/2593/Events/2593/petawilson_cohen_3504344_400.jpg?path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Wilson,%20Peta">do it</a> for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/granitz/0347-tom/Events/0347-tom/schiffe1.cla?path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Schiffer,%20Claudia">me</a> in the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/mptv/1399/Mptv/1399/21724_0005.jpg?path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Roberts,%20Julia">fantasy</a> department. Seriously, I think Abrams found his calling when he switched away from semi-funny relationship stuff into tech-action-mystery territory and <span style="font-style:italic;">Trek</span> will allow him to stretch even further in that direction. Casting this movie will be a bitch, that's for sure.</p>
<p>Two years is a long time but I can wait.</p>
