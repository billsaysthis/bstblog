<p>The US Men's team put a wallop on Mexico tonight, scoring twice in five minutes early in the sceond half <a href="http://www.ussoccer.com//news/fullstory.sps?src=rss&amp;iNewsid=233460">to win 2-0</a> and become the first team from CONCACAF to qualify for next summer's World Cup Finals. Steve Ralston clean up a rebound when Oswaldo Sanchez couldn't control Oguchi Onyewu's header and then DaMarcus Beasley drove a leftfooted shot across the face of the goal and into the top far corner where Sanchez simply had no chance.</p>
<p>After cooking a <a href="http://www.recipesource.com/soups/soups/14/rec1478.html">tasty roasted corn soup</a> (because TS1 is recovering from a little oral surgery), I watched the tape-delayed cablecast of the FC Dallas - Earthquakes match. Again a scoreless first half with my team dominating but unable to breakthrough and again two quick goals shortly into the second half, a header from Cerritos and a tricky bottom corner blast from strike partner Moreno, leading to a <a href="http://www.mlsnet.com/MLS/scoreboard/game.jsp?match=09032005_SJDAL">2-0 win</a>.</p>
<p>Other than increasing their lead over Dallas to 11 points (Galaxy remain nine back until tomorrow's result is known), no specific milestone with the triumph but I thought this effort was an exemplar of San Jose's unsung, barely noticed emergence as the quality team of the season. FSN color man Ray Hudson could hardly get enough superlatives out of his charming British mouth about Eddie Robinson's ability to shut down Eddie Johnson and turn the takeaway into a pinpoint 60 yard pass or Ricardo Clark's silky smooth defending in front of the back four or... well, you get the drift. Hudson basically went ga-ga over the while team.</p>
