<p>Koders.com is a new source code search engine. I've seen a number of favorable blogosphere writeups, which makes me wonder why their PR contact, Scott Howard at Milani Marketing, is spamming me about it through my contact form. Howard's bio claims 12 years experience working for companies from startup through global delivery so one could expect a bit more cluefullness.</p>
<p>No doubt I'm a good target for what I presume is their blog marketing campaign, but when the message sent is completely generic and doesn't get any personalization, not even a simple Dear Bill at the top, then in my book that's unwanted spam.</p>
<p>Too bad.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Update:</span> I received two email apologies from Howard and a manager at Koders. I still don't care for the approach but at least they owned up to the mistake.</p>
