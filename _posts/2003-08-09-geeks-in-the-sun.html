<p>Some events, well, they just surprise me. Like today, when Linux enthusiasts (and who's geekier than them?) will gather in Sunnyvale's Baylands Park for <a href="http://www.linuxpicnic.org/">Picn*x 12</a> to congregate and celebrate the 12th anniversary of <a href="http://www.linuxpicnic.org/history/">Linus Torvald's email</a> announcing his "operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones." Celebrating, sure even us geeks do that, but out in the broad daylight in the middle of Summer in a park? Oh my.</p>
