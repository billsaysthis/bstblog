<p>Since I complained to the doctor recently about being surprisingly tired, fatigued, even though I've lost plenty of weight and been exercising regularly, he ordered some blood tests. They came back negative. Next was the unsupervised sleep study which I did last night.</p>
<p>Not a fun thing and, not too surprising, not conducive to a good night's sleep! Given the difference between how I (and other people) normally sleep and how one is forced to sleep during this test, I do wonder how the results can be valid. Hell, the doctor had to give me an Ambien (sleeping pill) so I could even fall asleep at all.</p>
<p>The test basically involves attaching half a dozen sensors to various parts of your body: a tube with prongs that go inside the nostrils, one on either leg, one on the end of a finger, one around a wrist and two on the torso. All of these are at the end of a wire, with the other end of all of them coming together in a thick box which captures the data all night.</p>
<p>The recommendation, and reality, is that while wearing this mishegas one must sleep on his back, which I can normally never do. But I was encouraged to try and not take the pill, so I laid there for an hour listening to TS1 enjoy her sleep until I finally gave up and took it. Finally went to schluffy land and for all of five and a half hours. Great. Especially considering I hadn't slept well the night before, I expected the pill to get me a good seven hours or so but that was too much to ask for.</p>
<p>Now I get to wait two weeks for the results to be processed and sent to my doctor. I mean, we all know how slowly electrons travel in computers, right? Maybe tonight I'll finally get some rest.<br /></p>
