<p>TS1 and I went down to the Tank tonight and got to see a blast of a game that finished with the Sharks winning 6-5 over their top rivals in the Western Conference and defending Stanley Cup champs, the Detroit Red Wings.</p>
<p><a class="highslide" href="http://billsaysthis.com/uploaded_images/after-sharks-sixth-goal-754407.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/after-sharks-sixth-goal-754407.jpg" alt="" /></a> <a class="highslide" href="http://billsaysthis.com/uploaded_images/sharks-on-a-defensive-faceoff-792400.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/sharks-on-a-defensive-faceoff-792400.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>The Sharks opened fast, getting the first goal from Dan Boyle inside of three minutes but the Red Wings aren't the best team in the league the last decade or more for nothing and they tied it up fast, just a minute later. The Sharks' Joe Pavelski took three minutes to get the next, and that's how the first period ended.</p>
<p>The referees were just terrible tonight. Los Tiburones started the second and third period on penalty kills from some pushing and shoving as the teams went off the ice at the end of the periods, and the Red Wings capitalized on the first of those to tie it again 90 seconds into the 2nd and taking their first lead soon after. The Sharks got an equalizer from Christian Erhoff and the teams traded another pair of goals towards the end of the period.</p>
<p>The 3rd started 4-4 and I was afraid we could see a late goal loss like the Sharks gave up Thursday night, but Milan Michalek and Patty Marleau scored in quick succession midway through. The Red Wings were able to get a fifth score but despite pulling Chris Osgood for most of the last two minute of the game were not able to get the tie.</p>
<p>Se now Ts1 has been to two Sharks games in the last two seasons and our boys won both times! I think the Sharks should give her season tickets to see how long her streak can run. The loss to the Flames Thursday was the first home regulation loss in 11 months, tonight started a new run. I'd love to see them do what Chelsea did until earlier this seson, go more than four seasons without a home loss!</p>
