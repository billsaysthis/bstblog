<p>With the Sweet One moving in here soon and me jonesing for some new tech toy, I splurged on some sort-of necessary equipment to set this house up for WiFi Compliant networking. Hello, <a href="http://80211b.weblogger.com/about">802.11b</a>, goodbye Cat 5 cable! Linksys makes some extremely easy to set up and install equipment: <a href="http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=22&amp;prid=415">BEFW11S4 - EtherFastÂ® Wireless AP + Cable/DSL Router w/4-Port Switch</a> and <a href="http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=22&amp;prid=427">WPC11 - Instant Wireless Network Adapter</a>. Her desktop PC will get a wired connection to the access point when it arrives.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/wireless_boxes.jpg" alt="Linksys makes the good stuff" /></p>
<p>No more need for the perfectly good Linksys PCMCIA Ethernet adapter and annoying dongle, so it gets X'ed out.</p>
<p><em>Update, 30 minutes later:</em> The web is an amazing thing, as I am constantly reminded. Minutes after I published this entry in it's original form an email from E. J. Fischer arrived; he'd seen my blog passing through <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger.com's</a> Fresh Blogs listing. To get in that list, a blog needs to be one of the first 10 blogs published in any given minute (as determined by the clock on a particular Blogger server). Clicking through to my blog, what does EJ see but my entry about getting 802.11b set up here. EJ's dad <a href="http://nonlocality.blogspot.com/2002_06_23_nonlocality_archive.html#78365617">invented 802.11</a>. EJ writes the <a href="http://nonlocality.blogspot.com">Maelstrom Cognizance</a> weblog.</p>
