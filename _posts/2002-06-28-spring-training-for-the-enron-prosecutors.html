<p>So Arthur Anderson was found guilty, but their case was somewhat unique. The real crimes involved individuals in positions of trust enriching themselves by abusing that trust--are you listening, Andrew Fastow?--and the feds have filed their first case. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/business/AP-Enron-Bankers-Charged.html">3 Ex-Bankers Charged in Enron Scheme</a> worked for National Westminster Bank and "were able to siphon off $7.3 million in income that belonged to their employer, the Justice Department alleges." This sounds like the real meat to me and I expect the government to use it as a kind of Off-Broadway tryout, seeing which of the accumulated evidence gets admitted, which witnesses do best in front of a jury, which arguments go down best with judges, and only after this will we see brazen criminals like Fastow indicted. No need for speed here when what we want is the right result.</p>
