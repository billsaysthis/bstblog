<p><b>Today's movie: There's Something About Mary</b><br />

<p>The grossout lover story comedy that won the heart of a nation, 1998's <a href="http://www.clean-pipes.com/docs/mainhome.htm">There's Something About Mary</a> is still a great laugher. <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Diaz,+Cameron">Cameron Diaz</a> stars as possibly the greatest, most desirable woman ever born; simply put, every man who meets her falls completely in love. I'm looking forward to seeing Diaz in <a href="http://www.shrek.com">Shrek</a> and Scorsese's Gangs of New York.. <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Dillon,+Matt">Matt Dillon</a> is also great as a sleazy pseudo-private eye, while Ben Stiller continues to do less and less for me.</p>
