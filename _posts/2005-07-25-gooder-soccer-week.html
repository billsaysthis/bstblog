<p>I tell you, getting LittleSteven back from Fry's yesterday morning was a relief. Though it also meant nearly a day of pulling down Windows updates and patches, reinstalling and updating Office, reinstalling UltraEdit, SmartFTP, HotPopper, WinZip and SharpReader, reinstalling EazyBackup and restoring from backups. Last, copying back all six gigs of music files (all ripped from CDs I own, Mr. RIAAman!). Plus, TS1's PC Twiggy is having an ongoing problem with Norton AntiVirus and the instructions provided by Symantec are not terribly useful so that's still being tended to.</p>
<p>However, making the chores much lighter are the two wins the Earthquakes had this week lifting them into a tie with FC Dallas for first place in the West. The Texans do have two games in hand and one of them will be made up Wednesday so this may not last but I'll enjoy it while I can. Our boys get a decent break now; no more matches until after next Saturday's All Star exhibition against the Premiership's Fullham and none of ours were picked for it.</p>
<p>I was also happy to watch the US Men win the Gold Cup over Panama (in Spanish as I couldn't figure out how to get to the third audio channel for the English commentary), 0-0 after extra time so we won on penalty kicks. Kasey Keller was the man, though two Panamanians blew their own chances by hitting the crossbar and going over top. I thought their keeper, Penedo, was the only one preventing a US landslide as he made up for many mistakes by the back four. Nice to have the trophy.</p>
