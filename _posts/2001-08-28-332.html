<p><b>Gay judge to run for Helms' Senate seat</b></p>
<p>North Carolina Superior Court Judge Ray Warren, a former Helms staffer and Republican state senator, who came out of the closet and became a Democrat, is <a href="http://www.charlotte.com/observer/0828ray.htm">considering a bid</a> for the seat currently held by the retiring "crap-ocrat" Jesse Helms. This would be so cool I would be willing to move to North Carolina. (Of course they do have lots of good tech jobs there...) Great quote from Warren:</p>
<p>"We're all entitled to grow up," Warren said Monday. "George (W.) Bush had his problems with alcohol. I was a Republican. We both got over it."</p>
