<p><b>Yesterday's book: The Avatar, Book I</b><br />

<p>I've just started Book II so I'll defer a real review until that writeup. I will point out that this pair is the relaunch of Star Trek: Deep Space 9, continuing the story after the end of the TV series. The Dominion War is over, Odo has returned to the Great Link, Benjamin Sisko has gone to live with the Prophets, O'Brien has returned to Earth, and Coronel Kira is in charge of the station with Nog as her engineering chief and Ro Laren as head of security. With staff limited by the Federation's need to rebuild and repair so many planets and facilities after the war, life isn't easy but the only problem is time. Until three Jem'Hadar ships push through the Wormhole, destroy a Starfleet cruiser assigned to protect DS9, and nearly destoy the station itself. Until a religious leader shows up with a frightening accurate ancient book of potentially heretical prophecies, the next of which concern Jake Sisko and his unborn sibling, and is promptly murdered.</p>
<p>PsiPhi has a <a href="http://www.psiphi.org/cgi/upc-db/feature/new-ds9/">bunch of info</a> on the DS9 Relaunch including character, schedules, and excerpts.</p>
