<p>After owning this brown beauty since 1982, I think the time has come to find a new good home for my <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/telecaster/tele_incase_big.jpg">1979 Fender Telecaster</a>. I just don't take the time to play it and the money could be used for better things than sitting in a case in the closet. I have a <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/telecaster/line6_big.jpg">Line6 Flextone 60 Digital Guitar Modeling System</a> that matches well and provides an amazing range of sounds--the fancy name is appropriate, not pretentious--also available.</p>
<p>Details are on the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/telecaster/">For Sale page</a> but in short the Telecaster is $950, the Flextone is $325, and if you aren't local to me you pay shipping. The guitar comes with a very nice hardshell Choice Product Development Company velvet-lined custom case and a cheap metal guitar stand. The Line6 amp comes with a four button floor pedal.</p>
<p>For now, this site and Craig's List (<a href="http://www.craigslist.org/pen/for/12095935.html">guitar</a>, <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/pen/for/12096506.html">amp</a>) are my only marketing efforts, though I might put an entry on eBay soon too.</p>
<p><em>Update, 6/6, noon:</em> Sadly, even though I've had over three dozen people click through from the Craigslist ads, no one has yet made an offer or inquiry of any kind. Bill says this is sad, boohoo!</p>
