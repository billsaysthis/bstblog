<p><b>If this guy shows up at the office, be very worried</b><br />

<p>C|Net <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1014-201-6863340-0.html?tag=tp_pr">interviewed James F. O'Brien Jr., CEO of Promethean Asset Management</a>. Seems like an interestin guy, except that each of the companies the article mentions as a Promethean investment has made <a href="http://www.home.net/">major layoffs</a> or gone <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2693255,00.html">out of business</a>. Critics call him a purveyor of toxic loans although he claims to be misunderstood. Either way, I wouldn't really want to be working at a company that takes money from this outfit.</p>
