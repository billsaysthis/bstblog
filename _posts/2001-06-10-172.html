<p><b>Humor: Who really rules the roost?</b><br />

<p>Need a quick laugh? <a href="http://www.gethonest.com/TestButton.html">Click here</a> to watch a Flash animation and listen to its song about a married man's ability to really be king of his castle. Really reminds me of some late '50s/early '60s comics like <a href="http://wiw.org/~drz/tom.lehrer/index.html">Tom Lehrer</a>, before profanity and topicality became the mainstream of comedy. More recent comics might be <a href="http://www.morepower.com/tim.html" title="Fan site, the official site is for his signature power tools line">Tim Allen</a> and <a href="http://www.rayromano.com/" title="Official site">Ray Romano</a>, although Romano seems to me to be a big whiner. Some sample quotes:</p>
<p>"I where the pants around here after I do the laundry." "I don't want to hear a lot of whining around here so I'll shut up." "I can have sex any time that you want because I'm a man who has needs but they're not important."</p>
