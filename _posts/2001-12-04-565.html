<p><strong>Classic guitars, modern tech</strong></p>
<p>Gibson Guitar Corp., maker of some of the <a href="http://www.gibson.com/products/gibson/LesPaul/Classicpp.html">best guitars ever</a>, is looking to move those annoying cables hooking guitars to effects boxes to pre-amps to amps to mixing boards from dowdy old analog to digital with a <a href="http://magic.gibson.com/thisismagic.html">new open, royalty-free software standard</a> that runs on plain old Ethernet cable called MaGIC: Media-Accelerated Global Information Carrier. This very cool stuff (look for guitars with Ethernet ports in the <a href="http://www.techtv.com/news/culture/story/0,24195,3363342,00.html">next 12-18 months</a>) was developed by a group of 12 Gibson engineers right here in Silicon Valley over the last two years. "MaGIC provides a single cable solution that is trivial to install, requires little or no maintenance, and offers a data link layer that supports a simple yet sophisticated protocol, capable of offering a superior user experience." Author's bias note: I'm more of a <a href="http://www.fender.com/gear/gear.php?partno=0137502">Fender Telecaster</a> fan.
