<p>Most obvious: San Francisco 49ers head coach. Mariucci <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_01_12_blog_archive.phtml#90189689">got the boot</a> but Holmgren cannot get out of his Seatlle deal. I'm a lifelong football fan, and have subjected the Niners' efforts to rigorous analysis for the last six seasons.</p>
<p>William J. McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, today <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/17/business/17FED.html">announced his retirement</a>. I have an MBA in finance, real world experience in lending, insurance, investments, and technology plus I used to work across Maiden Lane from their office building so I know how to get there in the morning. Word to the hiring team: I believe that a little inflation is a good thing as is a lot of operational transparency.</p>
<p>A job that would have been suitable, but is apparently already filled, is Chairman of AOL Time Warner. Seriously, I have a great blend of experience in online technology and the written word. I've been a customer of HBO since they first began mass marketing it in the early '70s and am a huge Sopranos fan. I've even worked closely with AOL previously, during the whole iPlanet not-quite-a-joint-venture Sun/Netscape Alliance thing. Hard to understand that the board could <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/managementtopics/xsp/isptelecom/story/0,10801,77678,00.html">move so quickly</a> to give Richard Parsons a second job when I have none.</p>
<p>Reality check: Uggh! I've been looking for work for too long if I'm starting to have these fantasies. I am pursuing some leads at Oracle, Google, Ariba, and Sun (as a contractor), to name a few, so perhaps something good will come along soon. Keep your fingers crossed and <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/contact.phtml?sub=Job Help">drop a line</a> if you can help.</p>
