<p><em>[Via <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com">garret</a>]</em> Perhaps this is going to be a <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_01_06_blog_archive.phtml#8522780">recurring topic for me</a>, though I can tell you it sure gets my goat.

Ooh, that's not fair, they said. Cops can't stop people at sobriety checkpoints AND see if they are in the ountry legally! One Undersheriff quoted in the article declared, "A sobriety checkpoint is for sobriety. We wouldn't ask that. We shouldn't ask it. We have enough to do with criminals without bothering people who are here just to try to make a better life."</p>
<p>I say: Are these people in the country legally? Did the police violate some international treaty or convention by checking their documentation? Did the people of this country tell the federal government to repeal the laws regarding legal immigration? The answer to all is no. We don't owe people in other countries the right to come here and break our laws, not even simply the ones regarding immigration. If people who are here legally want to change the laws, go for it. Otherwise, don't complain when illegal immigrants have to leave.</p>
