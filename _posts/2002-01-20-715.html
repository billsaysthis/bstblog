<p><strong>I thought the fighting in Afghanistan was over</strong></p>
<p>Apparently some protesters don't think so since 50 of them from the War Resisters' League turned out at St. Patrick's Cathedral this morning. However, they clearly <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/p/ap/20020120/us/1011552673antiwar_protest_nyr109.html">don't know how to dress</a> or make dolls either.</p>
