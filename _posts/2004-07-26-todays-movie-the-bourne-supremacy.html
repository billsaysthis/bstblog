<p>An excellent movie, an excellent sequel in the true sense of the word.&nbsp;A new directory but the same writer give a different energy but a continuing understanding of the characters and problem space. <a href="http://www.thebournesupremacy.com/">The Bourne Supremacy</a> looks to be tops at the box office, giving Hallie Berry's <em>Catwoman</em> the thrashing it clearly deserves.</p>
<p>Matt Damon so blows away his buddy Ben Affleck and this effort is no different. Joan Allen is very impressive as a CIA executive who thinks she has Bourne's number and Brian Cox returns as the sleazy Ward Abbott; Julia Stiles&nbsp;made a good career choice to return even though once again she has a fairly small but all grown up part. Karl Urban doesn't say much, which is probably good since he isn't really Russian even if he does play quite the murderous one here.</p>
<p>Director Paul Greengrass brings <em>Bourne</em> the sharp, distinctive visual style he used in his debut feature, Bloody Sunday, and it seems like an evolution past the MTV cliched quick cuts we've all come to know in the last 20 years. As opposed to, say, Steven Soderburgh's <em>Traffic</em> from a couple of years ago where color filters were supposed to be innovative, Greengrass and his editors use their technical chops to bring out Bourne's inner confusion and strength.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_07_07_blog_archive.phtml#85234945">good</a> as the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_06_09_blog_archive.phtml#85171977">original</a>? Oh yeah!</p>
<p><em>absolutely recommended</em></p>
