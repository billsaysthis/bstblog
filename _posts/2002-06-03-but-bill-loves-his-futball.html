<p>Denmark-Uruguay yesterday, Argentina-Nigeria this morning, England-Sweden this afternoon. Some terrific soccer. England have to be disappointed with their result; the team did not live up to expectations, fell down after a strong start, and continued their 34 year streak of not defeating the Swedes. Argentina are just the opposite, <a href="http://worldcup.espnsoccernet.com/report?match=48813&amp;lang=en">squeezing passed</a> the very young Super Eagles 1-0 on a super header by Batistuta off a Veron corner kick. Today's two games showed off the fearsome nature of corners, as England's score also came off of Sol Campbell's head. Nigeria gave up corner after corner and you knew sooner or later the South Americans would take advantage. Still, the draw has to have the Nigerians thinking they may have a chance to advance even after the loss if they can manage a draw and a victory in the next two games.</p>
