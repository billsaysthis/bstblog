<p>Truly <a href="http://www.wordless.com/cgi/article.asp?ArticleId=26">striking article</a> on the fact that some individuals, able to function normally or above (math graduate with honors at university, for example), even though they have essentially no brain. "Instead of two hemispheres filling the cranial cavity, some 4.5 centimetres deep, the student had less than 1 millimetre of cerebral tissue covering the top of his spinal column." Some additional detail <a href="http://web.syr.edu/~sndrake/necbrain.htm">here</a> and <a href="http://216.239.37.100/search?q=cache:yJkbe6uwhgcJ:www.enidreed.com/serv01.htm+john+lorber+university+sheffield&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8">here</a>. Talk about your outliers! [<em>via <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/26688">MetaFilter</a></em>]</p>
