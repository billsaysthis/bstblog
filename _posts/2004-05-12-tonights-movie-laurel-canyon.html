<p>You know a film is all about the artsy when most of the characters use accents that aren't their own and the dialog is denser than TGI Friday's Death by Chocolate dessert. 2002's <a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/laurelcanyon/indexFlash.html">Laurel Canyon</a>, written and directed by Lisa Cholodenko, is just such a film.</p>
<p>Christian Bale and Kate Beckinsale (an Englishwoman sporting an American accent) are engaged and move to his mother's supposed to be empty house in Laurel Canyon; he's starting a medical residency and she's finishing her doctoral thesis. Mom is played by Frances McDormand, a legendary rock and roll producer now finishing up an album with raunchy English rocker Alessandro Nivola (despite the name, born in the USA); despite the 20-ish year age difference producer and singer are lovers. The final key player is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/hh/0001523/HH/0001523/Untitled7.jpg?path=pgallery&amp;path_key=McElhone,%20Natascha" title="Oh yeah, she's pure gorgeous">Natascha McElhone</a>, English-born playing an Israeli one year ahead of Bale in the residency program and his carpool driver.</p>
<p>Mom and rock band show up, unexpected of course, to use the house's outbuilding recording studio. Bale has always resented and felted abandoned by her, as she pursued a life of hedonistic pleasure and music rather than being his parent (Dad is neither mentioned nor seen) and her presence is a stiffling imposition--she has another home in Malibu and is supposed to be staying there. Both Bale (by McElhone) and Beckinsale (by McDormand and Nivola) are tempted to stray.</p>
<p>Mainly the characters talk. And talk and talk. There's a moderate amount of mostly-covered flesh flashed. Some minor interesting emotional revelations. Cholodenko seems satisfied with a stolid, languid pace and does find some interesting visuals, including the very last shot of Bale in the house's pool.</p>
<p><em>mildly interesting</em></p>
