<p>All the pundits forecast that Liverpool would come out tonight to squeeze the life out of their Champions League second leg match after bringing home a 1-0 win from the Bernabeau two weeks ago. Rafa confounded everyone, including the Spanish brain trust, by having the players blaze up the field from the start and there was really no doubt at all that the Reds were moving on to the semifinals for the fourth time in the last five years.</p>
<p>The outcome was clear from the first Liverpool attack in the first minute when Fernando Torres took the ball at the top of the box with his back to goal, backheeled it between Fabio Cannavaro's legs, spun around Cannavaro to the outside and regained possession to get off a shot that was only stopped by a great save from Iker Casillas.</p>
<p>The Reds continued pounding Real relentlessly and broke through just before twenty minutes when Torres muscled Real's other central defender Pepe off the ball. Dirk Kuyt was just outside of them and touched the ball back to Torres in the center and, with Casillas pulled out of position, Torres needed just the lightest of taps for the goal. Torres never beat Madrid in his years with crosstown rivals Atletico but now has two in two weeks!</p>
<p>The Reds got a huge favor from the sideline assistant ten minutes later when he raised his flag for hand ball by Gabriel Heinze inside the box. Replays showed it came off the Argentine's shoulder but the officials don't have the benefit of video and Captain Stevie coolly sent the PK the other way for numero dos.</p>
<p>Just after the restart the Reds broke down sloppy back line passing--which they did the whole game, to be fair--and Ryan Babel drove clear to the touchline where he pulled it back to Stevie G, who scored again from a very difficult ball. Andrea Dossena, a late sub, got the final tally just before the end when Casillas could not get back to recover from one last giveaway by his field players.</p>
<p>Besides the score good things from this match:
<ul>
<li>Torres was doubtful to play at all but got the opener and was very aggressive coming back on defense to harrass the Madrid midfield.</li>
<li>Gerrard showed a full recovery from his ankle woes</li>
<li>Jay Spearing made an impressive senior team debut after subbing in for Gerrard in the 72nd</li>
</ul>
<p>Draw for the next round is on Friday. Already through are Chelsea, Villareal and Bayern Munich--the German side was especially impressive today, drubbing Sporting of Lisbon 7-1 to go with a 5-0 beatingin the first leg. Favorites to go through tomorrow are Manchester United, Arsenal and Barcelona, and though I have no idea about Atletico Madrid v. Porto I would certainly like to see my Reds draw the winner of that matchup.</p>
<p>In the Premier League the Reds are having a rough spell but today's result and the 2-0 beating of Sunderland last time out should give them a good frame of mind for Saturday's crucial visit to Old Trafford. Only a win gets them back in the title race, though a draw or a tight 1-0 loss will give them hope should the two meet later on in the Champions League.</p>
<p>Liverpool v. Manchester United in the May 27 final in Rome, now that would be a dream fixture!</p>
