<p>An out and out police farce--compared to the original TV series--<a href="http://starskyandhutchmovie.warnerbros.com">Starsky &amp; Hutch</a> is plain funny. Not smart and funny like, say, a Woody Allen or Coen Brothers film but more in line with the better National Lampoon movies. Director/co-writer Todd Phillips (<em>Road Trip</em>, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_03_21_blog_archive.phtml#107990396891917239">Old School</a>) is showing increasing skill and improving timing. Ben Stiller gets a role and a director that keeps his more obnoxious habits in check and Owen Wilson is smooth and smart.</p>
