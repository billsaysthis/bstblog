<p>TS1 and I went from owning no Apple products ever just two years ago to being 100% Macified now. We each have a MacBook, iPod Nano and iPhone, and this week our Time Capsule arrived to complete the set. Admittedly we have the small end of the scale on each but they're sufficient to our needs and make me happy. With the MacBook at work I'm almost completely insulated from the madness that is Windows, especially the strange, strange Vista.</p>
