<p>Dave Winer had <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/10/23#markAndSam">something kind to say</a> about <a href="http://www.syndic8.com/~wkearney/blogs/syndic8/">Bill Kearney</a>. Without being overly dramatic, these two have been going at it, and not in a friendly way to the best of my knowledge, for years on various mailing lists and discussion boards. When I say going at it, I do mean that there were lots of nasty words strewn about, not just technical disagreements.</p>
