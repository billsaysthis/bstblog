<p><b>Condit: Roadkill</b><br />

<p>Shedding his veil of silence 150 days after the disappearance of Chandra Levy before 23 million viewers and Connie Chung, Modesto congressman Gary Condit did himself little or no good. Reaction from his constituents was largely dismissive and personally I thought he showed us a politician who doesn't deserve re-election. Typical of the press he's getting today is <a href="http://www.vny.com/cf/News/upidetail.cfm?QID=214484">Levy lawyer says Condit lying about cooperation</a>.  The <a href="">Palo Alto Daily News</a>, which doesn't put it's content on the web (boo hiss), headlined it's front page article <b>Condit Crumbles</b>. <a href="http://www.topfive.com/">Top Five</a>, a daily email humor list, of course made the interview the subject of <a href="http://www.topfive.com/arcs/t5082401.shtml">today's list</a>; sample line: "His baloney has a first name, and his baloney has a second name, but he's not telling either." See ya, wouldn't want to be ya, Gary.</p>
