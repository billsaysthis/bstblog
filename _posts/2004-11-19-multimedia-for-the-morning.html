<p>The Big Guy sends along this <a href="http://uk.download.yahoo.com/ne/fu/oa/eurcncs185030.mpg" title="Note: the link goes directly to a video file">Citroen C4 video</a>, not sure if you could really call it an ad, more like a mashup of car, giant robot and dance music.</p>
<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/AWholeLottaNothing?m=84">Matt the PVR Man</a> points out <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/jowhiley/live_lounge/lemar_nov04.shtml">this really great version</a> of U2's <span style="font-style:italic;">Vertigo</span> by a young English R&amp;B star <a href="http://www.lemar-online.com/">Lemar</a>. This is just the singer, playing acoustic guitar, in a BBC radio studio and he really gives the song a different, romatic feel. Not that I don't love <a href="http://www.u2.com">the original</a> too, there are too few out and out rockers I hear these days and this one really hits the spot.<br /></p>
