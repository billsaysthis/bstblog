<p>Watching hockey can be fun but not being able to see the puck or understand the rationale behind certain penalty call decisions hurts. OTOH, seeing the Sharks score two goals in the last 19 seconds of the game today, to force OT in the last regular season game, and then win on a massively aggressive effort in the extra period is suh-weet.</p>
