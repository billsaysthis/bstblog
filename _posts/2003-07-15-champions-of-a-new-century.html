<p>A football match raged onscreen,<br />
<br />the home team's supporters chanting loudly<br />
<br />as their midfielders passed the ball from side to side,<br />
<br />probing the half line for an opening into space.</p>
<p>You could hear 44,000 voices lifted together:<br />
<br />"When you walk through a storm<br />
<br />Hold your head up high"<br />
<br />As the patched ball rolled on.</p>
<p>On the field of Kenny, Bill, Ian, and Rowdy<br />
<br />Now run Michael, Sammi, Danny, and Stephen<br />
<br />The glory of the past holds but a candle<br />
<br />To the brilliant future coming to Anfield</p>
<p>So watch proudly as the ball arcs high,<br />
<br />Straight into the box and our man runs<br />
<br />Straight onto it, one touch, one defender to beat<br />
<br />Straight off and through the keeper's legs.</p>
<p>For the Reds always stand proud<br />
<br />Gunning for more silverware<br />
<br />Devils stand back in awe<br />
<br />All the other teams blue with envy.</p>
