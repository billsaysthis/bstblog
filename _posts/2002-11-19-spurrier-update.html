<p>In our ongoing look at the changing world of NFL head coaches, I notice that my <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_10_20_blog_archive.phtml#85589656">most recent prediction</a> has come true. Far from being the Redskins' starting quarterback for the rest of the season, Shane Matthews was <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/columns/pasquarelli_len/1462610.html">demoted for second time</a> to third on the depth chart. Coach Spurrier has yet to decide between Danny Wuerffel and Patrick Ramsey for his next victim/starter but both seem likely to get significant playing time.</p>
<p>Good for a laugh: Spurrier said "The offense has struggled. We've struggled in pass protection. So it's not all on Shane. But we want to see what the other guys can do." As if they haven't all had the chance to be screwups in his Not Ready for the NFL Offense.</p>
