<p>The New York Times has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/opinion/17sun1.html">endorsed John Kerry for President</a>. While this comes as no surprise to anyone, I think the simple straightforward wording (their summary: <em>"John Kerry has qualities that could be the basis for a great chief executive and we enthusiastically endorse him for president."</em>) used combined with substantive, detailed explanation makes for a very powerful roundhouse to the Bushinator. I'm particularly moved by the next to last paragraph:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>We look back on the past four years with hearts nearly breaking, both for the lives unnecessarily lost and for the opportunities so casually wasted. Time and again, history invited George W. Bush to play a heroic role, and time and again he chose the wrong course. We believe that with John Kerry as president, the nation will do better.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm proud to join the New York Times in endorsing John Kerry and I ask you to join me in voting for him on November 2. The last four years have been <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/roberts10152004.html">increasingly shrill, divisive and mean</a> and  believe John Kerry is the only choice if we wish to truly reunite this great country.</p>
