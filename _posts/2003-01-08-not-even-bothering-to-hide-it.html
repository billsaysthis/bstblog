<p>As reported by the Washington Post in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A24585-2003Jan7.html">House GOP Softens Its Ethics Rules</a>, the Republicans in Congress aren't even waiting or bothering to disguise their avariciousness! Only eight years ago, when the party rode it's laughable Contract with America into legislative power, the House passed rules minimizing certain types of open bribery. Now, seizing the moment, they've voted (on a pretty straight party line basis) to remove these rules. Just like so many of the same politicians who were so hot for term limits in the '90s--when they were on the outside--are now saying that experience counts and so they should continue to run. How typical!</p>
