<p><b>Today's Book: The Street</b><br />

<p>And I do mean today's book: this was one <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.04/streetcred.html?pg=4">thriller</a> that kept me turning the pages all day until I finished it. Lee Gruenfeld has cynically captured the feverish quality of the recently ended Internet investment boom in a mystery novel that ratchets up the tension until an ending you won't be expecting. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385501501/o/qid=990670306/sr=8-1/ref=aps_sr_b_1_1/104-9321367-1418332">Recommended</a></p>
