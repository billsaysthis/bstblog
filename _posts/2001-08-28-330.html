<p><b>Do not f%#k with Matt Taibbi</b></p>
<p>Matt, I am your buddy, pal, friend, never fear Bill is here. Just please don't do to me what you <a href="http://www.exile.ru/122/feature.php">did to Thomas Nolle</a>. I will admit that he's a strikingly good example of some of the excesses in our economy/society. But wow! did you ever get him. And, Matt, Nolle was wrong, oh so wrong!</p>
<p>Nolle, a New Jersey telecommunications consultant, came to Matt's attention after being quoted in the LA Times saying that the Internet is run by "hippy anarchists. Don't get on Taibbi's wrong side--not responding to a letter brought on Nolle prank orders of pizza and grocery deliveries, calls to government agencies and known employers, and worse. Worse? How about calling police to report a domestic dispute at Nolle's home and a call to his neighbors from the DEA who'd "like to ask you a few questions if you could, not about you, but about your neighbor, Tom Nolle." The kind of terrible things that make life a nightmare.</p>
<p>Matt and Mark Ames, the men behind <a href="http://www.exile.ru">eXile.ru</a>, live and publish in Moscow but focus on Western topics such as how consultants foisted on Russia by the World Bank to administer aid from the bank pocketed all of the loot. And how good life is in Moscow if you have a few dollars and the guts to brave the place and its macabre mafia violence. The two <a href="">published a book</a> last year full of their cruel and caustic humor, telling tales no major American paper would dare publish. Let's just say that being in Moscow gets eXile a lot of slack when it comes to legal ramifications.</p>
