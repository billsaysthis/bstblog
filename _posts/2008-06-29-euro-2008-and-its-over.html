<p>Liverpool's Fernando Torres finally broke a hard luck duck and scored the only goal of the final to lead Spain to their first major tournament trophy in 44 years after going close moments before, denied by the post. Germany rarely solved the core of Senna and Xabi in the center of midfield and when they did Carlos Puyol ended the threat so even with the end of game surge Iker Casillas had to make only one true save.</p>

<p>Michael Ballack was on the losing side for a third major championship in the last six weeks, getting a runner's up medal here to go with the two from Chelsea's losing to Manchester Uniter in the Champions League final and Premier League. Ballack, I will admit, has never been on my favorite player list, stemming from his play-acting in the 2002 World Cup quarterfinals when Germany beat USA 1-0 on questionable refereeing.</p>
<p>Speaking of which: Andy Gray, ESPN's color man, said early in the second half "[Rossetti]'s the ref. He has the <a name="qual" title="Per the European meaning, he passed the referee's certification">qualifications</a>." There were far too man questionable decisions, such as the yellow to Casillas for dissent and lack of foul calls against the German centerbacks, but fortunately the outcome wasn't affected. Where's <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierluigi_Collina">Pierluigi Collina</a> when we really need him?</p>
