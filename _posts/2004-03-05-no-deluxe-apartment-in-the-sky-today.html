<p>Some sadness here this morning as I cut the remaining financial ties to Sun Microsystems. Back in the day it fueled some big dreams but foolishness inserted itself into my reality and erased <a href="http://brucespringsteen.net/songs/NoSurrender.html">these romantic dreams in my head</a>. In the end, I think I paid more in <a href="http://www.reformamt.org">AMT</a> and other taxes than I actually made in profit, which shows what a wonderful system we have.</p>
