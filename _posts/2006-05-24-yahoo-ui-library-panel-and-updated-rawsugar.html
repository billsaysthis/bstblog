<p>I'm having a little problem with the tendon in my right pinkie so the doctor advised to cut down on typing, meaning even less posting here. Boohoo. But I did want to mention the latest small technical addition I made to the site. Yahoo! has releaed a nice open source JavaScript UI Library and I used the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/container/panel/">Panel widget</a> to rewrite the way the "Last 5" entries from my <a href="/wp">politics</a> and <a href="/movies">movie review</a> blogs are displayed. Just click the link to see it in action.</p>
<p>I've also implemented the new blog integration code from <a href="http://www.rawsugar.com">RawSugar</a> on this blog and the movie reviews. This version is even slicker, with complete control of how the embedded tag box appears and--this is the new part--<a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/rs_results.php?rs_close=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.billsaysthis.com%2F&amp;rs_s=user%3Abillsaysthis&amp;rs_q=%2F/rawsugar">how the search results show up too</a>. You can really make it all look like your own site, have the results appear in the same page as the tag box or on a dedicated page. Subsequent tag clicks, refining a search, refresh in place (that is, an Ajaxy no page reload) and when a user clicks the <span>X</span> close button, the same URL where the search started is redisplayed. Very nice work, and you can use it for your blog too, no charge.</p>
