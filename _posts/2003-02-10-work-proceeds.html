<p>I am sitting here in a freezing house this morning suffering from coffee withdrawal. Where is the building inspector? I know the deal is he shows between 9 and 12 but come on, I want to go get coffee already! And the house is freezing because the contractors insist on having the front door open. I just had to go outside to move my SUV and it is actually colder in here than out there, what's up with that?</p>
<p>But the work seems to be going well this morning. Most of the new vanity is in place and they are beginning to cut the cultured marble pieces for the shower. Outside, making a lot of dust, so I had to go out there and move the truck so it wouldn't get covered. With the dust.</p>
<p>Damn, the cold is making it difficult to type!</p>
