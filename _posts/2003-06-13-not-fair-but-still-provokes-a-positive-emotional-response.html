<p>My old high school, Livingston HS back in Jersey, made it on to this list of top schools in the <em>entire nation</em> at number 488 and doesn't that impress the heck out of you? "Public schools are ranked according to a ratio called the Challenge Index" which measures the proportion of the graduating class taking an AP or IB exam. Private schools, which bias their student bodies by using scholastics as an entry criteria are not included. So 488 but then you leave out all the schools that have only good students, meaning the 488 is fairly meaningless, eh? One oddity that struck me in perusing the top of the list is how many schools from Long Island are in the top 30. So if students are encourage to take these exams, regardless of their results, the school gets a boost.
