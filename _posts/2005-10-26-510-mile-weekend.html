<p>One of the biggest chunks of driving I've done in a long time, that's for sure, definitely the most since I moved to Cali in 1996. Worth it since we had a real good time and we lucked out when it came to traffic, with almost no slow zones except the few miles between Gilroy and 85 on the last leg home.</p>
<p>I got a few decent photos from the Hearst Castle tour though most suffered from the no flash rule or shaky from being rushed along problem:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=hearstcastle_10_05&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=terrace_longview.jpg">Long view</a> down to the Pacific off the main terrace</li>
<li>The big, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=hearstcastle_10_05&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=bigpool.jpg">really big outdoor pool</a> with Roman temple facade</li>
<li>Tall <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=hearstcastle_10_05&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=egyptian_goddess.jpg">Egyptian goddess</a> sculpture</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=hearstcastle_10_05&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=middlesized_guesthouse.jpg">medium-size guest house</a> (which is of course bigger than 90% of American homes)</li>
<li>A classic, 400+ year old <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=hearstcastle_10_05&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=huntertapestry.jpg">hunter tapestry</a></li>
</ul>
