<p>Charles Stross, a fellow <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/20966">MeFite</a>, is, it turns out, an awesome science fiction writer. Even though I'd heard his name previously, it was just recently when he turned up on MetaFilter that I decided to try and grab one of his books from the library. What a great premonition that was. <a href="http://www.penguinputnam.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,0_0441011799,00.html#">Singularity Sky</a> has to be one of the best finds I've made, along with <a href="http://www.kagebaker.com/">Kage Baker</a>, in recent years.</p>
<p>This novel has an amazing amount of creativity. The basic concept is something like this: Not too far in our future the intertwirling development of ubiquitous connectivity, increasing processing power, genetic engineering and globalization drive us into a Vingean singularity and moments later a deity-like entity named the Eschaton reaches back into its own past to plant 90% of humanity on a spread of suitable worlds. The Eschaton also warns humans not to mess with the timeline, now possible with another of Stross' creative takes on SF tech, under pain of serious slapdown. Delivered via, say, planetkilling asteroids or worse.</p>
<p>Several hundred years have passed as we meet our new friends. Some planets are more or less technological dreams, others have chosen to turn their backs and stick with a 19th century-ish lifestyle. People are still people, except for those who've uploaded into one of any number of systems, and so emotions continue to drive their actions regardless. Then Stross throws in a wildcard: the Festival, a multi-species aggregation of uploaded entities, who travel from solar system to solar system to connect up off the grid worlds, as they do Novy Petrograd on the first page.</p>
<p>I'm trying to find some words that aren't just more plot explanation and simple fanboy fawning but it's difficult. This is really good. The characters are interesting people, given good dialog and interesting changes. Sometimes, just briefly, I did feel like there might have been a bit of just showing off stuff because he thought of it, just a bit.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">definitely recommended</span></p>
<p>BTW, I "ran into" Charlie in <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_04_07_blog_archive.phtml#75138269">a blog way</a> three years ago</p>
