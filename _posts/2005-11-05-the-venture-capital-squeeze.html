<p>Paul Graham simply has a great way of saying useful things and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/vcsqueeze.html">The Venture Capital Squeeze</a> is no exception. For sure the people going to SHDH5 tomorrow will be in agreement with his thesis, and many of them are essentially the people he's writing about.</p>
