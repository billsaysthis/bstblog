<p>Out for three weeks now, Terminator 3 just does not seem to be getting the job done. For all the hoopla, SFX and politics (will <a href="http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/index.asp">Schwarzenegger</a> run for governor of California?), the box office take after three weeks is <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=terminator3.htm">a piddly $127 million</a>, falling to under $10M this weekend. With a production budget of $200 million plus another $40M or so for marketing, this is one expensive dud. In the end, after foriegn box office take, DVD, PPV, and TV rights, the whole thing will probably break even (not that anyone will really know given Hollywood's byzantine accounting systems) but this is just another in a Summer of movie disappointments. Arnie's first big role in three years, for sure it has to be chalked up as <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0216216">yet</a> <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0146675">another</a> <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0118688">failure</a> by an actor whose time has passed.</p>
