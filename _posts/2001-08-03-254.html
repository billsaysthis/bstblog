<p><b>Please explain the appeal</b><br />

<p>Remixes are popular, Mariah Carey is popular and so we have her new <a href="http://www.glyphs.com/forums/load/music/msg0706325632031.html">Loverboy video</a>, which features a remix of the song. I guess I'm just getting old, but the remixed version was just unlistenable like something from <a href="http://www.lyricfind.com/artists/3296/">Wu Tang Clan</a>. We all know why <em>I</em> think the latter is unlistenable but in general Carey has a pleasant voice and decent songs. This remix, though, reverbs multiple overdubs of her voice against an amped up bass line and not much else, playing the song's chorus over and over again. Okay, I'm old and out of it, that's all. At least she's showing off her <a href="http://www.mariahmusic.hpg.com.br/foto41b.htm">nice, if surgically enhanced, breasts</a>.</p>
<p>Completely irrelevant but Mariah's in the hospital after a <a href="http://music.yahoo.com/music/news/sonicnet/story.html?a=n/music/news/sonicnet/rock/20010802/1/p1&amp;b=n/music/news/sonicnet/rock/20010802/1/p2">nervous breakdown</a>.</p>
