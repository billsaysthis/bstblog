<p>1) <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1008_3-1000421.html?tag=fd_lede2_hed">IBM details Blue Gene supercomputer</a> - 130,000 CPUs linked in a single machine to operate at one quadrillion operations per second. Holy shit!</p>
<p>2) I updated the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/entertain/carlin_questions.phtml">George Carlin page</a> since Carlin himself has disavowed authorship of the joke list. Oh well.</p>
<p>3) <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/_yahoo/funds/stephenschurr/10085883.html">ROE v. Paid: For Tech CEOs, Money Is No Object</a> - Not surprisingly, an analysis by The Street.com shows there is no correlation between return on equity  (ROE) and CEO pay. Just shocking that CEOs keep getting more even when they aren't earning it.</p>
<p>4) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/08/opinion/08HERB.html">Trouble in Bush's America</a>, by Bob Herbert on the NYT OpeEd page, just magnifies that CEOs and their ultra-wealthy cronies are satisfied with this so-called jobless recovery even if it leaves many of us looking the toilet straight in the eye.</p>
