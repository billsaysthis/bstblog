<p>Last week <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_01_19_blog_archive.phtml#90233462">I wrote</a> about preparing for a very interesting job opportunity. Would have been my first time working directly in sales, for a world class company no less. Finally heard back today and, you may have already guessed, the interviewers did not think I met the needs of the position. They are, of course, wrong but the decision is theirs. So I'm still looking. Keep a good thought.</p>
