<p>The Sharks' third goal today was so smoooov! Jonathon Cheechoo took a pass from Brad Stuart as he was crossing in front of the crease and pushed it back through his legs, with his stick going through too, straight in under Aebischer's legs ("a highlight-reel staple for the foreseeable future" according to the AP report). Got to give props to excellent goaltending from Nabakov and the goals by Patrick Marleau following up his Game One hat trick, Vinny Damphousse and Wayne Primeau (an empty netter!).</p>
