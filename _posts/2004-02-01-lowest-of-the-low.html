<p>The Night Exchange is now running <a href="http://www.nightexchange.com/nightExchange/Washroom.wmv">a TV ad</a> which consists solely of an attractive young couple having sex in a bathroom stall. <a href="http://www.nightexchange.com/nightExchange/">The Night Exchange</a> is one of those telephone personal services, so why am I not surprised that the company is using the promise of fast, easy sex as the advertising hook. I shouldn't complain, at least sex is fun and (if done right) not painful or dangerous. Rockstar Games, on the other hand, is setting sales records with video games like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> that celebrate wanton murder and violence.</p>
