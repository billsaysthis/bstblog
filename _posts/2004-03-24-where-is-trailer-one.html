<p><a href="http://www.bringbackkirk.com/">Bring Back Kirk</a> has released its <a href="http://www.bringbackkirk.com/trailer.html">second trailer</a>, what seems to me to be a pretty amazing effort by a volunteer group of fans who have some good ideas on how to revitalize the franchise. Their HTML skills could use some help but do yourself a favor and download and watch their nine minute production.</p>
