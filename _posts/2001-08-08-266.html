<p><b>A former Green comes clean</b><br />

<p>Are we, as a global society, blowing the future health of our planet and therefore ourselves through foolish activities? Or is the truth <a href="http://www.economist.co.uk/science/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=718860">something different</a>? A Danish statistician set out a few years ago to challenge a <a href="http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/~jsimon/">prominent economist</a> who doubted the claims of environmentalists. He found out instead that the environmentalists were, generally, wrong. Interesting reading. Then again, there's the old saying: lies, damn lies, and statistics. But given the author's bias you have to doubt that he's playing games.</p>
