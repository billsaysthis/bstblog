<p>Joel and Ed, in case you've come looking in response to yesterday's invitation, I updated <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/about/resume.phtml">my resume</a>. Actually, I didn't do it for you guys but to make my technical background clearer to staff and independent recruiters who might come looking for a Product Manager, Business Development Manager, or Technical Support Manager. I have solid enterprise Ecommerce and Internet experience and would be a good match if your product is aimed at or requires enterprise developers. I speak their language, I work well across functional lines, and as this website shows, I know how to communicate.</p>
