<p><strong>Psychotic and an Adams fan</strong></p>
<p>Clayton Waagner is a seriously dangerous man, a man who feels he "was anointed and called to be God's Warrior.... He freed me that I might lay down my life for His Will." God's will being, of course, the death of large numbers of people who work at abortion clinics; he has made a real threat against 42 such unnamed people. Therefore, <a href="http://wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,48692,00.html">Abortion Clinics are on alert</a> across the nation. Steven <a href="http://denbeste.nu/entries/00001486.shtml">points out</a> that this is as much a terrorist threat as Al Quaeda albeit on a different scale and deserves a major response from the Bush Administration. But Waagner must also, in some twisted way, be a Douglas Adams fan, that's the only place I know of where a reference to the number 42 makes a connection.</p>
