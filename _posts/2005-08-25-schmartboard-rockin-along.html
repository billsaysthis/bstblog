<p>I owe a shoutout to Neal Greenberg because <a href="www.schmartboard.com">Schmartboard</a>, his engineering-oriented startup, has been given a slot at <a href="www.demo.com">Demo</a> next month. This is a significant milestone for the company because invitations to present are limited and many more companies want to get on stage than are allowed.</p>
<p>To quote Neal: "Although, I am sworn to secrecy on our technology until the show on Sept 19, I can tell you that every electronic engineer that has seen it, is astounded!  It will solve a significant problem in circuit design and electronics education." Sounds good to me!</p>
<p>His team has already launched <a href="http://www.schmartboard.com/index.asp?page=SchmartDeveloper">SchmartDeveloper</a>, the first electronic circuit design open source repository. Seems like this will be a SourceForge for circuit designers and there are already people signed up from around the globe.</p>
