<p>This company, Bravenet Web Services, provides many free services to webmasters. At one point I signed up to try one or two of them out, though I never actually implemented any on my website. To even try things out, the site requires webmasters to register and provide a valid email address. I try to use the unique email address for each site I register at, usually websitename@mysite. Now I'm getting porn spam to the email address I provided to them. Swell. On the other hand, I can block that address now and not be bothered by these assholes.</p>
