<p><b>Chicago terror: was this a close call? Definitely a problem</b></p>
<p>No one doubts that there will be additional terrorist incidents, the only surprise to me is that we haven't seen more already. Perhaps the government is doing a good job? Well, I wonder if the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml?type=topnews&amp;StoryID=347576">arrest of Subash Gurung</a> was going to be another airplane attack. Gurung was arrested Saturday before he could board a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Omaha with several long blade knives and a stun gun in his carry-on. Let's see, he's a Muslim from Nepal, young but not too young (27), and in America on an expired student visa holding a fake immigration employment card.</p>
<p>But that's not the whole story. Gurung made it past the security checkpoint at O'Hare, but airline employees at the gate area searched his bag in a routine check and found the weapons. Argenbright Security, the largest US airport security contractor, has been cited repeatedly fo similar breeches. One wonders how members of the House of Representatives who voted against federalizing airport security are reacting to these continuing problems.</p>
