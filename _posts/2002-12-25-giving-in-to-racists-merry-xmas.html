<p>The Associated Press reports that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/international/AP-A-Saudi-Christmas.html">Saudi Arabia Frowns on Christmas Cheer</a>. Gee, that's a shock, isn't it? Foreign Christians (and any other non-Muslims) are not allowed to worship or show signs of their religion in public. By definition any non-Muslims located inside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are foreigners since that nation's constitution requires all citizens to adhere to that religion. What really got my gaul, though, is that our government is so willing to defer to others' fears and biases that no Jews are ever assigned to work there. The Kingdom, our great and wonderful allies, generally won't let people of my religion into the country.</p>
<p>I was moved to write about this to Colin Powell, Barbara Boxer, Diane Feinstein, and Anna Eshoo:</p>
<p>I just became aware that the Department of State discriminates against Jewish employees by not allowing them to serve in positions located in, or requiring travel to, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>I believe that no American should be limited in such endeavors due to the racism of other nations. I'm sure if the Saudis had the same policy regarding women officers we would not acquiesce and cannot see how this is different.</p>
<p>I would appreciate your assistance in correcting this situation.<br />
<br />-----------</p>
<p>I would have written more but I doubt even that little bit will get read or any attention. I know Israel does not prohibit Muslim diplomats.</p>
