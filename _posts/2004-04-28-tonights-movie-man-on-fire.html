<p>Key comment from LordB while watching <a href="http://www.manonfiremovie.com/">Man on Fire</a>: This movie is so slow we can sit here doing play by play and not miss a thing. Tony Scott is a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001716/">veteran director</a> with plenty of taut thrillers in his past, so I don't really understand why he didn't cut the 146 minute run time down to 100-110. Almost every scene is bloated, slow, almost languid except when he's doing his MTV thousand cuts per minute, shake the camera to make you dizzy imitation.</p>
<p>Denzel Washington is great, even trying to get through this morass, and he has great chemistry with Christopher Walken--why haven't they worked together before? Dakota Fanning, if she doesn't burn out, could be one of the great ones, she's just intuitive and natural in all her scenes.</p>
<p><em>not recommended</em></p>
