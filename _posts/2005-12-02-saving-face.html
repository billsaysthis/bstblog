<p><a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2005/12/02#blogpodwikicastsAreConversations">Doc Searls reports</a> that Adam Curry, caught redhanded making self-serving edits to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting">the Wikipedia entry on podcasting</a>, told him it was simply "pilot error." However, <a href="http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/news/2818/adam-curry-caught-sticky-wiki">as Rogers points out</a>, Curry's edits were made at several different occasions and erased mention of several different other people. Further, this isn't the first time he's pushed other folks, such as Dave Winer, who had as much or more to do with than Curry himself out of the limelight. The ex-MTV VJ is an old hand at managing the media but for my money he's scrambling to cover for poorly thought-out decisions and not quite making it. <em>Sad</em>.</p>
