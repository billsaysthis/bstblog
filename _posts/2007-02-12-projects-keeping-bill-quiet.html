<p>I've been working on two projects the last couple of weeks, plus of course job hunting, and that's kept me from blogging. But the Grammys are on the tube and boring the heck out of me--why did everyone make such a big deal about the Police reuniting to open the show and then the group only plays <span style="font-style:italic;">Roxanne</span>? The band slowed down the tempo, robbing it of its urgency, and lowered the key, I guess Sting, for all his pumped muscles, can't quite reach the high notes of 30 years ago. Ugh.</p>
<p>One project I've got in the pipeline is for a volunteer group newly-elected Mountain View City Council member Jac Siegel has organized called Community Helping Community. I'm developing a small application to handle volunteer signups and event postings using Ruby on Rails and MySQL. Hopefully you'll be able to see it soon, if I figure out a few tricky-ish things.</p>
<p>The other project is (yay!) a small consulting job for a venture funded Israeli startup. First task is setting up a WordPress blog for the company, which is mostly done, and then on an ongoing basis write the blog as well as help the company participate in the web conversations surrounding them and their areas of expertise.</p>
<p>I was hoping to get an offer from a very exciting startup company based on a strong open source project but it didn't happen, some of the managers felt the position required a level of technical (Java programming) competence which I don't have. Though my own opinion is different and so this outcome was disappointing.</p>
<p>I did have a good morning of interviews for another position two days later and this too seems interesting, a good match for my skills and experience while offering the opportunity to exercise my leadership, creativity and imagination. I'm an optimist and always expect the good outcome.</p>
<p>So, life is good, eh? Still, if you know of a good position or need some consulting help don't hesitate to reach out.</p>
