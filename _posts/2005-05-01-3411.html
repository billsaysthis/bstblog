<p>Tim O'Brien updates the Warren Buffett picture pretty well in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/business/yourmoney/01INSURE.html?ex=1272600000&amp;en=6dcf3da14f982a33&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">For Buffett, the One That Got Away</a>, covering the two big issues confronting Berkshire Hathaway these days. Those are the potential legal scandal and general underperformance of General Re, one of the company's big insurance holdings, what to do with the humongus and growing cash pile that'll produce meaningful returns, and the bigger longterm question of who can possibly fill Buffett's chair when the 75 year old no longer sits in it.</p>
