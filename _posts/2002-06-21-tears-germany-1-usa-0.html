<p>Some strange business midway through the second half. USA has a free kick from about 30 yards and off to the right but before we can start Reyna and Neuville are pushing and jostling and Scottish referee Hugh Dallas stops play. The agitation continues, so Dallas waves Reyna over to the side of the box while he goes to consult with the sideline assistant. After much chatter, he walks back on and shows yellow to both players, the kick comes in but the Germans have had too much time to organize and catch their breath.</p>
<p>The cards start flying, Pope, Lewis, Mastroanni, Burhalter all getting one, and since all four had one already from the Mexico match, they would not be playing next time if we had won.</p>
<p>Cobi Jones and Ernie Stewart both come on as the final US substitutions for more offense while Germany uses theirs for more defense. Keeping 11 men behind the ball any time the US has posession, still we come close on a few plays. Tony Sanneh, who has had an outstanding tournament, gets his head on the ball twice, one time missing the left side of the net by inches, and those are the best scoring chances we get.</p>
<p>We couldn't get on the board, Kahn with his defenders was simply too tough but Friedel was almost as good. He was supposed to share playing time with Kasey Keller but coach Bruce Arena could not ignore his fine play and so Keller, very unhappy, claiming he was lied to, never got on the field. Friedel is my Team MVP!</p>
<p>And so the American team goes home with heads held high. Reyna drove his mates further than ever before--I could see the respect from the Germans the entire second half and then in the aftermath, the way Rudy Voeller, a mean goalscorer himself before taking the national team reins, was making a point of talking with many American players. Next time out, when the Germans have home field advantage, we will be there and not just for respect--but with that home field advantage plus some superb young players like Klose on offense and Kehl at center defense they have to be favorites next time.</p>
<p>Nothing here or in the Brazil-England match, though, makes me rethink my <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_06_16_blog_archive.phtml#85181752">previous call</a> for this Finals: Germany will go through to the finals after defeating the winner of South Korea-Spain (probably South Korea on emotion and a rumored injury to Raul) but will not be able to handle the play of the Brazilians.</p>
