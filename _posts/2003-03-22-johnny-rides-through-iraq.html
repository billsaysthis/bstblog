<p>Blistering light races down on a rough and cracked ground<br />
<br />Heat pushes back against the hairs on his freckled arm<br />
<br />Johnny swivels his head while his APC moves through the desert<br />
<br />His ears alert to the unheard sounds of enemy fire.</p>
<p>Just now a nearby tank launched two rounds<br />
<br />Against a target over the horizon, further than Johnny<br />
<br />Can see but from the cheers he understands that the<br />
<br />Target was hit and destroyed.</p>
<p>A reporter sitting near him outs down a few hasty notes<br />
<br />Looks up and around for a few beats, puts his pen back to paper<br />
<br />Johnny doesn't worry about what the man writes,<br />
<br />Only that he gets home with all his arms and legs intact.</p>
<p>Home, that faraway place where a pretty girl waits for him<br />
<br />Home, where he played basketball in the winter, soccer in summer<br />
<br />Home, with his nice warm bed and eggs for breakfast that<br />
<br />Don't get cooked by adding boiling water.</p>
<p>Johnny has yet to see an enemy combatant though he did meet<br />
<br />Two guys from Liverpool, UK Marines, while standing and waiting<br />
<br />In Camp New Jersey, amid the nasty dust storms, and found<br />
<br />They too were Knicks fans and LFC supporters.</p>
<p>Bouncing along at 40 or 50 klicks an hour, Johnny's division<br />
<br />Is eating up the dust so fast and sooner than anyone expects<br />
<br />They will arrive outside of Baghdad, dismount and assault<br />
<br />Johnny only hopes his camo and gun will protect him.</p>
<p>The LT taps him on the shoulder and points out into the distance<br />
<br />Where a flock of birds is flying past the end of the line of trucks,<br />
<br />Tanks, and helicopters of Johnny's group force, barely visible<br />
<br />Past this force that stretches off into infinity, flapping their wings.</p>
