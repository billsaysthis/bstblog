<p>I know, this book has been out for so long, how did I not already read it? Oops. Still, I will say that JK Rowling has improved her writing considerably from the very first book and seems to have gotten past the "too good for even the slightest of editing" egotism that bloated several of the middle volumes. Even though this one runs to just under 700 pages, far fewer of them are wasted and there's very little thrown in magic that shows her cool imagination without advancing plot.</p>
<p><a href="http://scholastic.com/harrypotter/books/prince/index.htm">Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince</a> is the next to last book in the series and the war with Voldemort is out in the open. After what happened in <span style="font-style:italic;">Order of the Phoenix</span> (I read this but for some reason didn't write it up) no one in the Wizarding community doubts He Who Must Not Be Named is back and aiming to complete the takeover Baby Potter blocked him from finishing 15 years before.</p>
<p>This is the first of a two parter, I think, which is fine. Rowling has set up many threads and a great deal of depth; she hasn't forgotten the little touches that are so popular with readers either, like Quidditch—Harry is captain of the Gryffindor team, a responsibility of which he's proud and happy to take at first but weighs him down as other events  require his attention—and various magic class lessons.</p>
<p>In fact the latter is the source of the book's title. Not expecting to take Potions this term Harry and Ron didn't buy the textbook and new Potions professor Slughorn lends them copies from the classroom until their's arrive (Snapes has finally gotten his desire to teach Defense Against Darks Arts). Harry's borrowed copy is filled with notes from a previous owner, the self-styled Half Blood Prince, which he uses despite Hermione's frequent protests. The identity of the student, be warned, is not revealed until very late, something which TS1 seemed unhappy about when she read <span style="font-style:italic;">HBP</span> but I thought was a good effect.</p>
<p>Harry has little choice at this stage except to throw off what little remains of his childhood. Rowling gives us a bit of a model for him in Fred and George Weasley; the brothers have left Hogswart a year early and parlayed their love of joke magic into a thriving Diagon Alley shop. Potter is also forced to deal on an adult level with Professor Slughorn and Dumbledore, and his conflict with Malfoy simmers in the background. We also get a peek at Voldemort's biography and understand why he became so evil—to some degree, Tom Riddle becomes much more human and sympathetic though there's no question he must be defeated.</p>
<p>If you thought I'd say anything more about the story, sorry, but I hate giving spoilers no matter how long a book or movie has been out. We are definitely looking forward to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in a few months and will certainly get to it very soon after publication to avoid seeing the inevitable spoilers others are no so considerate about posting.</p>
