<p>I saw a three minute clip of the infamous Paris Hilton sex video this morning and I am no longer interested, even for prurient reasons, in seeing the whole 26 minute escapade. I do wonder what the hell the rich little hottie was thinking when she agreed to make the tape--sure she's young and presumably naive but a person who has so much to protect ought to be aware enough at the age of 18 or 19 to just know better. I suppose, though, that when you have over $300 million most of your non-fatal mistakes are easy enough to get past. If the embarassment gets too intense, she could just buy herself a small island and go hang out until the storm passes.</p>
