<p>A co-worker got a new laptop, a generic Asian brand, which came with Windows Vista pre-installed. Inside he found a photocopied sheet that says:</p>
<p><em>"ATTENTION, During the first boot of Windows Vista please allow for 15 to 30 minutes for the booting procedure to finish. You MUST NOT shutdown the system by force in any one of the following stages (screenshots), otherwise it may result in irrecoverable errors."</em></p>
<p>Have I mentioned lately how happy I am to not be running Windows? I actually had to install VMWare Fusion last week and WinXP on top of it, something that has not given me any real joy but necessary to test web pages on IE6.</p>
