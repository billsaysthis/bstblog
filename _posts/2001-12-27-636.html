<p><strong>Micro-advertising experiment, day 12</strong></p>
<p>Wednesday, Wednesday was a very good day for the ad, getting eight clickthroughs out of 360 views for a 2.22% CTR and a total of 58 from 3,930 views for a 1.48% cumulative CTR. I'm not getting any emails from these visitors but I wonder: if you came through the MetaFilter ad and are visiting again I would be interested in hearing from you, tell me your impression of this site.</p>
