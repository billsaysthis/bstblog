<p>All kudos for the War on Terror aside, Dr. David A. Sprintzen of Long Island University has compiled a sad, sorry<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.truefacts.co.uk/cgi-bin/trufax?a=dubya">list of accomplishments</a> for the Bush Occupation. These type of decisions plus the likelihood that he'll get a chance to nominate two or more justices to the Supreme Court are exactly why I opposed his election. With any luck, this year's midterm elections will hold to form and the Democrats will pick up enough seats in the House to block too much damage.</p>
