<p>Our National Security Advisor has an up close and personal view, so I have no doubt her assessment will prove correct: <a href="http://www.trivalleyherald.com/Stories/0,1413,86~10669~2189429,00.html">Bush will rank high, Rice says</a>, referring to what she sees as history's view of GWB. Or maybe I do because, as Dan Gilmor points out, <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/010458.shtml">We Don't Need No Stinking Constitution</a>. Gilmor quotes <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-turley3jun03,1,4346441.story?coll=la-news-comment-opinions">Jonathon Turley</a>: <em>Civil liberties are tolerated only to the extent that they will not interfere with the government's actions.</em> Who or what will inconvenience the Administration next? Or will we just not hear about them because action was taken carefully and quietly enough no to attract any attention?</p>
