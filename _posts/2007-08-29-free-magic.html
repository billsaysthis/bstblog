<p>Well, you can grab the first single off the upcoming Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band release <span style="font-style:italic;">Magic</span> from iTunes as a freebie for the next week. The song, <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://brucespringsteen.net/songs/RadioNowhere.html" title="Lyrics link">Radio Nowhere</a></span>, is an uptempo rocker that (perhaps not surprisingly) reminds me of his <span style="font-style:italic;">57 Channels</span> with a bit more buzzy guitar.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/estreet07tour.jpg" alt="2007 edition of the E Street Band" border="0" width="450" /></p>
<p>The band's tour was also announced today. There are 32 dates from October 2, the day the CD comes out, through the end of November and the stops are most of the major American cities and then over to Western Europe. The only Northern California concert will be October 26 at the Oracle Arena in Oakland and while I loves me my Bruce I doubt we'll be going. Friday after-work rush hour from here to Oakland is literally insane.</p>
