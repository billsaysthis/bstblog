<p><b>You knew it was coming (1): AmIAMoronOrNot.com</b>
<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="http://hotornot.com">HotOrNot</a> (the original) <a href="http://amihotornot.com">AmIHotOrNot</a> and <a href="http://aminakedornot.com">AmINakedOrNot.com</a> comes the (apparently) anti-religious <a href="http://morons.org/articles.php3?VOTE=2&amp;aid=128&amp;score=4">AmIAMoronOrNot</a>. The Web really is becoming a place where anyone can publish anything. Heck, even this weblog is essentially free.
<p>By the way, HotOrNot is turning into a matchmaking service too, with its MeetMe feature. To use it, though, you have to post a pic of yourself.</p></p>
