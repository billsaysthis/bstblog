<p><strong>Joel on strings, XML, and Shlemiel the painter</strong></p>
<p>Joel Spolsky goes <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000319.html">deep into the byte manipulation</a> to show why XML will get beat by relational database technology every time there is a non-trivial anount of data involved. And Joel's company has released their new content management product and you can get the <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/CityDesk/fog0000000033.html">Starter Edition</a> for the downloading. Shlemiel the painter is an old European joke about a painter.</p>
