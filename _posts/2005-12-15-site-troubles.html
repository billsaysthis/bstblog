<p>I can't explain how it happened, though I'm sure going to be asking TextDrive for an explanation, but all the tables in my main database got emptied overnight. This means that a bunch of pages, like the book reviews index and all the photo galleries, are offline until I can correct this. <span style="font-weight:bold;">#$#*!!@#!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Update:</span> I think I recovered about everything from files leftover from the recent hosting transfer, though without any help from TextDrive despite filing a support ticket 12 hours ago.</p>
