<p>Yeah, the work on the new bathroom is coming along nicely. The building inspector was here yesterday early to check over the plumbing and gave a thumbs up; another inspector is scheduled to visit Monday morning to check another aspect of the work. The contractor, Frank, appears to have done well laying in cement to even out the floor under the shower. The new exhaust fan/light fixture is installed in the ceiling and the shower pan and sheetrock walls around the shower are also in place. I had expected there would be more than one worker, with the other person installing the new vanity and related pieces while Frank does the shower and toilet, but I suppose this only makes a difference of a day's duration in the job. As long as it comes out right. And, at least so far, knock on wood, I haven't had so much as a peep of the kind of trouble so many people complain about when it comes to remodeling and contractors. "Excellent," as <a href="http://sb.eyeonspringfield.co.uk/index.php?page=sounds">Mr. Burns says</a>.</p>
