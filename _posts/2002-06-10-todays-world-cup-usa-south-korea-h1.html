<p>So it's 1-0 USA at the half! Clint Mathis took a lovely pass in, damped it with his right foot, and slammed it passed Lee, the Korean keeper, in the 24th minute. Brad Friedel had a positively brilliant save on a penalty shot after Jeff Agoos took down one of the Koreans in the box. The commentators, especially Ty Keough, keep saying that the American team and its fans should not expect many calls to go in its favor given we're playing the home team. Keough surely has been right, with two fouls in the box by Koreans that probably would have been penalties had it been any other team.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed!</p>
