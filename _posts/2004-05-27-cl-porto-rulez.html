<p>FC Porto showed real power and cohesion in <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=151504&amp;cc=5901">winning</a> the Champions League final today. The first few minutes were unsettled but after that Monaco had almost zero offense and barely got off any shots on goal the rest of the way. 19 year old new Brazilian star Carlos Alberto, a surprise starter for Porto, got the first score in the 39th minute and after that the outcome was never in doubt as the Portuguese team's back line was taller than six Shaqs in midieval armor. But fast.</p>
<p>There was a shot of Porto coach Jose Mourinho after the third goal, he was calmly drinking from his water bottle, but I could just hear the <del>dollar</del>Euro signs rining in his head as he calculated how much extra the result would be worth in his next contract. After taking the three best trophies he could this year--Portuguese League and Cup plus this massive bit of silverware--the possibility of him not moving to a major club <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/champions_league/3746255.stm">is nearly nil</a>.</p>
<p>After the game, the coach confirmed he expects to be named head of a club in the Premiership in the next few days. The hot rumor is Chelsea, which <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_02_22_blog_archive.phtml#107758299540675095">still has not settled</a> with Claudio Ranieri, but also mentioned is topless Liverpool. Don't think I need to tell you where I'd rather this new genius lands.</p>
