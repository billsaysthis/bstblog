<p>While I generally don't bother with these things, <a href="http://www.danshafer.com/onemind/?q=node/167">Dan's answers</a> to the traditional <span style="font-style:italic;">Inside the Actors Studio</span> Questionnaire inspired me to add my own:</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">What turns you on?</span><br />Clarity</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">What turns you off?</span><br />Thoughtlessness</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">What's your favorite curse word?</span><br />Pardon the language but: pile of steaming moron shit.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">What sound or noise do you love?</span><br />Twin melodic distorted guitar playing, such as Dickie Betts and Duane Allman on the early Allman Brothers records (especially "Whipping Post" from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_Fillmore_East">At Fillmore East</a>) or <a href="http://www.thin-lizzy.com/">Thin Lizzy's</a> Brian Robertson and Scott Gorham exemplified by "The Cowboy Song" from their 1978 <span style="font-style:italic;">Live and Dangerous</span> double album</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">What sound or noise do you hate?</span><br />Muffled bass and drums from car stereos turned up so loud they make <span style="font-style:italic;">my car</span> vibrate at a stop light.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">What is your favorite word?</span><br />Yes</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">What is your least favorite word?</span><br />Because</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">What profession other than your own would you like to try?</span><br />Movie Producer</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">What profession would you not want to try?</span><br />Dan's answer, Medicine, is one I agree with but my answer has to be truck driver. I'm not Zen enough to stand the monotonous boredom.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">If there's a heaven, what would you like God to say when you get there?</span><br />Existence: why is it so confusing?</p>
<p>What are your answers?</p>
