<p>I thought this was some kind of secretly filmed biography of me. At least that's what my girlfriend said. Turned out to be one of the latest heavy duty British crime dramas featuring Ben Kingsley as a bad guy to whom no one, even other bad guys, want to say no. <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0203119">Sexy Beast</a> is Gal (<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Winstone,+Ray">Ray Winstone</a>), a retired Brit criminal living in the beautifully sunny south of Spain with a hottie former porn star wife, who gets recruited by Kingsley for a bank vault ripoff led by the even more psychotic Teddy (Ian McShane).</p>
<p>The film easily divides into two acts, Gal's recruitment in Spain and the job back in London, which have little to do with each other and have Gal as the only character in common. This is the first filmed directed by Jonathon Glazer and the first (produced) screenplay by Louis Mellis and David Scinto and is remarkable more for the performances by the three actors mentioned here than anything else. Avoid it if you have a problem with heavy English accents or expect more in the way of plot.</p>
