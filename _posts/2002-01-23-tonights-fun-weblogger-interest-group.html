<p>Tonight we had the third meeting of the <a href="http://webloggerinterestgroup.manilasites.com/">Weblogger Interest Group</a> here in Mountain View, first at Dana St. Roasting Company (thanks, Nick) and then over beers at the <a href="http://www.tiedhouse.com/locations/mtn_view.html">Tied House</a>. About 20 people turned out and we had a nice discussion about personal versus professional conflict in what one writes in a weblog. While I don't work just now, I am aware that future employers or clients may come and look at the archives. Good thing I don't say fuck a lot. Or shit.</p>
<p>The big event tonight was a demo of the new Blogger Pro from Pyra Labs (aka <a href="http://www.evhead.com">Ev Williams</a>), which is launching this week. I was definitely impressed with what I saw and will be coughing up the $35 as soon as he opens the PayPal door. Some of my favorite of the new features were draft/publish to the future posts (that is, write something now but hold off publishing until I say so or until some specific time), titles for posts, use of lightly loaded servers, publish to email, and (coming soon, not in the first release) RSS generation. Amusingly, I did not notice a new Blogger Pro icon but hopefully this will be remedied quickly.</p>
