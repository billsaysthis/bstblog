<p>In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/01/opinion/01hiro.html?ex=1267419600&amp;en=06658c5d01cdf4af&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">Allah and Democracy Can Get Along Fine</a> Dilip Hiro makes an enlightening discussion on the possible forms an Islamic Iraqi democracy may take. More interesting to me, though, was this sentence from the first paragraph: <em>"This prospect is sending a chill down the spines of many Westerners, who see it as a preamble to the rise of a theocratic regime in Baghdad that would be a far cry from the liberal, secular Iraq envisioned by the Bush administration."</em></p>
<p>Anyone who seriously suggests that anyone in the Bush Administration expected a secular Iraq is feeding the audience a line; while some of the Neocons may have wished fondly for a secular Iraq, even I do not believe them to be that naive. What really caught my attention was the other adjective Hiro used: liberal. This guy may have written two books (as his end of essay credit mentions) about the Middle East but he clearly isn't a member of the same reality-based community as me.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Hiro is correct in using the liberal label but does so in a <em>1984</em>-like style where words mean what the government says they do rather than, say, the <a href="http://dictionary.oed.com/">OED</a>. In that case, of course, he is free to use liberal in this instance but then we are left with a term that no longer has any semantic value. After all, the Republicans big curse in the 1980s was to call someone (*cough* Dukkakis *cough*) a "card carrying Liberal" to dismiss any of the person's positions or policies as worthless. If the Bush Crew did indeed use the term in reference to post-liberation Iraq I can only sit here and gaze blankly at my screen.</p>
