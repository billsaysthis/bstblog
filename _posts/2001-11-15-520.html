<p><b>Pompeii: New erotic murals</b></p>
<p>Reuters is reporting on a set of recently unearthed <a href="http://www.reuters.com/printerfriendly.jhtml?StoryID=375356">erotic murals</a> at the ancient Roman playground of Pompeii. The 16 works were found in a unisex public bath nicknamed the Pleasure Spa. I bet they were having some pleasure, judging from the murals. Pompeii, which was huge, much larger than I expected, is the city buried in lava when Mt. Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD but incredibly well-preserved and the subject of ongoing archeological efforts. Oh well, Dad and I <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/italy/italy_tripsorrento.phtml">got there</a> a little too soon. Is another trip called for?</p>
