<p><b>Magnitude</b></p>
<p>During the Civil War, at the <a href="http://members.nbci.com/civilwar/antietam.htm">Battle of Antietem</a>, over 23,000 Americans died in a single day. To my absolute horror, disbelief, and disgust, today may have been worse. I feel like I've been pummeled, punched in the stomach, and stomped on.</p>
