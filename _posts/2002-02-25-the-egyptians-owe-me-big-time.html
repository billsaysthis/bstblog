<p>A secretive group of lawyers and academics is <a href="http://usatoday.com/usatonline/20020221/3880341s.htm">preparing a lawsuit</a> against companies that benefited from slavery in America before it was outlawed 140 years ago. Of course, some of the allegedly targeted companies didn't even exist then, they just happened to have acquired companies that did. Apparently this "powerhouse team" is willing to ignore legalities if it suits their needs in favor of using public opinion to force targets to acquiesce. But hey, I'm Jewish and my forefathers were slaves to Egyptians a few thousand years ago, so let's go claim money damages on the current government. Alan Dershowitz, where are you when your people need you?</p>
