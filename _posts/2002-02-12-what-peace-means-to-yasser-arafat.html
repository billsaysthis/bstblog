<p>Boston Globe columnist Jeff Jacoby shows us <a href="http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/041/oped/What_peace_means_to_Yasser_Arafat .shtml">what 'peace' means to Yasser Arafat</a>, really, and doesn't paint a pleasant picture. On the one hand Arafat writes an <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/search/abstract?res=FA0D11F73C590C708CDDAB0894DA404482" title="This is an abstract only, the Times wants money to read the entire article">op-ed piece</a> for the NY Times claiming all he wants is for the violence on both sides to end and for everyone to live in harmony. On the other hand, he appeared before Palestinean rallies the same week and called for "Millions of martyrs marching to Jerusalem!" And by martyrs, he does mean suicide bombers and the like, have no doubt about that!</p>
