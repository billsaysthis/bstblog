<p><b>Yesterday's movie: Meltdown/High Risk</b><br />

<p>Watched a very funny Jet Li movie last night, which is called Meltdown on the DVD but <a href="http://www.jetli.com/jetli/projects/projects_filmography_21.php?bw=">High Risk</a> on <a href="http://www.jetli.com">The Official Jet Li Website</a>. A criminal kills Li's wife and some schoolchildren after collecting a huge ransom; two years later, they face off again when "The Doctor" (played by <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Wong,+Kelvin">Kelvin Wong</a>) and his crew target some antique jewels at the opening of their exhibition. By this time, Li is working as the bodyguard (and stunt double) for martial arts film star Frankie Lane. Lane is famous for doing his own stunts but Meltdown shows us that's just PR BS, Lane was a world class fighter who's long since degenerated into a sex-crazed party wimp. To my eyes, the Lane character mocks Jackie Chan but in the end the charater redeems himself by defeating the most dangerous of The Doctor's crew. Lots of laughs, not the least of which come from the dubbed English voices (Li does not do his own), and good fighting scenes.</p>
