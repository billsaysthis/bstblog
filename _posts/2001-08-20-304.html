<p><b>Today's movie: Shrek [again]</b><br />

<p>True, I saw Shrek <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_05_27_blog_archive.phtml#3824701">not too long ago</a>. But it was very good, funny, in terrible taste, and a very special four year old wanted to see <a href="http://www.shrek.com">the flick</a> again. So we were there, laughing and loving it. Best version of <a href="http://gunther.simplenet.com/v/data/imabelie.htm">I'm a Believer</a> in years at the end.</p>
