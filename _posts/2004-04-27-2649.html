<p>Joe, you <a href="http://coolstop.com/radio/archives/001168.shtml">misunderstood</a> the point of the exercise. And somehow I doubt people clicking through from Jeremy's page to mine (which is what I was referring to, not people finding that entry through a Google search) are looking for penis enhancement.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Joe, understanding is everything.</p>
