<p>No indeed. Barbara Card Atkinson writes an <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0930/p09s01-coop.html">elegant opinion piece</a> for the <em>Christian Science Monitor</em> that in very few words brings the emotions of people like her, and to a lesser degree myself, directly to the surface. For all the disagreement I may have with our fearless leadership in DC, the one issue unlike Mrs. Atkinson I cannot put aside is why they are not doing more, or really anything I can see, to get more jobs right here in America, for Americans. Huge amounts of deficit spending, something that was anathema to Republicans ten short years ago, and very little benefit to the vast majority of us. The word 'sad' comes to mind.</p>
