<p>Props to Landon Donovan! He's been <a href="http://sanjose.earthquakes.mlsnet.com/MLS/news/team_news.jsp?ymd=20041025&amp;content_id=17753&amp;vkey=news_sje&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;team=sje">nominated for the Honda Player of the Year Award</a> for the third straight year. DaMarcus Beasley and Carlos Bocanegra are the other two nominees and one wonders if one of them will knock Landon off his two year hold--he's the only player to win this twice in a row so a threepeat would set a great precedent.</p>
<p>I'm too biased to give a real prediction but I will say <a href="http://fantasy.premierleague.com/M/stats.mc?element_filter=te_10&amp;stat_filter=&amp;price_filter=&amp;view=&amp;element=">Bocanegra</a> is playing 90 minutes consistently for Fullham in the English Premier League while <a href="http://www.psv.nl/show?id=747&amp;dbid=626&amp;typeofpage=891">Beasley</a> is mainly coming on as a second half sub for Dutch Eredivise frontrunners PSV Eindhoven. Both of the challengers are US National Team starters as well but Donovan is once again leading the American side with five goals so far this year.</p>
<p>My heart says Donovan is too easy for the voters, the sentimental choice will be to give him the hat trick before he leaves for Germany. Beasley, Bocanegra or perhaps <a href="http://sanjose.earthquakes.mlsnet.com/MLS/players/bio.jsp?team=sje&amp;player=ching_b&amp;playerId=chi444955">someone else</a> can <a href="http://www.soccerhall.org/history/HondaPlayeroftheYearAward.htm">drive the car home</a> in 2005.<br /></p>
