<p>Here's a scary article for your Xmas cheer: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/26/international/asia/26nuke.html?ex=1261717200&amp;en=99cc1addec414c7f&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">As Nuclear Secrets Emerge, More Are Suspected</a>. The one positive thing I came away thinking is that if a non-state group (Al Qaeda and such) did get the necessary technology from AQ Khan, why haven't they used it yet? I see little advantage for them in waiting compared to North Korea or Iran. Then again, what do I know about how such people think?</p>
