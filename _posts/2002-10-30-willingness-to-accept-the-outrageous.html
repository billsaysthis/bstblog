<p>Wired News reports in <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,56072,00.html">Cancer's Enema No. 1? Make That 2</a> that a respected researcher, who's investigating a new treatment regime for extremely deadly pancreatic cancer, cannot sign up enough patients for his trial to get a valid result. After three years, only 25 patients (90 reqired) have signed up even though his earlier trial showed that participants' life expectancy improved from 5 1/2 months to nearly 18.</p>
<p>So why the hesitation on the part of oncologists to refer patients? Because part of the treatment seems outrageous. It doesn't fit the big medicine paradigm of expensive drugs. So other researchers tarred it with the epithet of alternative. What does <a href="http://www.dr-gonzalez.com/">Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez</a> propose? Coffee enemas! Twice a day. Okay, also 150 specially formulated nutrional supplements and an organic, vegetarian diet. Not necessarily easy to conform to but those who do seem to find it worth the effort.</p>
