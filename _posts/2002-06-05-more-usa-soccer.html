<p>What an amazing game! A goal in the fourth minute, I thought, hey even if we lose, at least we scored first. Then, with the seecond goal, maybe we have a chance for a draw. After all, the Portugese have to wake up at some point, right? But then the third goal, McBride in the the 36th minute, I'm thinking we may win. Talk about wishing I had not stopped biting my nails! I was watching on tape and it was all I could do not to fast forward or walk over and check on the web but through sheer force of will I held myself back. And was it ever worth it! You can say Figo has a torn ligament in his ankle, you can say the Portugese defenders were asleep for the first half, I don't care. We have the three points, we have the momentum, we have a legitimate shot to go through to the second round. What an amazing game!</p>
