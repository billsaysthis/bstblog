<p>Opening note of appreciation to Fox Sports World for giving us same day coverage of Liverpool FC's Premiership opener against mid-level opponent Aston Villa. Manager Gerard Houillier has written the same names in the starting list except for Djimi Traore at left back (due to injury) and, the surprise, El Hadji Diouf replacing Emil Heskey as Michael Owen's partner up front. Diouf, you may recall, scored the goal that set the tone for this year's World Cup, putting Senegal over France 1-0 in the tournament's first game.</p>
<p>Three early yellows: Alpay of AV (14th minute) for a bad challenge on El Hadji Diuof, then Diuof four minutes later for protesting too much, and Haman for a serious feet into the legs of Hendrie.</p>
<p>In the middle of a strong offensive stretch, in the 21st minute came the best challenge yet for AV, Dudek saved a goal by knocking a shot against the crossbar.</p>
<p>28th: Gerard puts a beautiful cross across the box right onto the foot of Diouf only a couple of yards in fron of the goal bu the Senegalese international couldn't get the handle and lifted it well over the top. Three minutes later John Arne Riise just barely misses the top corner with a header. Short while later Danny Murphy takes the third yellow for the Reds to block an AV breakout.</p>
<p>First half ends with some good offense from Liverpool but the Aston Villa defenders, especially star Turkish international Alpay, are up to the challenge and we at 0-0. Liverpool is certainly favored but, after Arsenal (2-0 over newly promoted Birmingham City) and Manchester United (1-0 West Bromwich Albion) opened their seasons with victories, all three points must be taken home.</p>
<p><em>Second half</em> gets off to a bang as John Arne Riise scores from the left corner off a very quick counter attack. AV had two solid shots on goal but Liverpool defenders were there to block both. After a couple of headers forward, Danny Murphy took charge and raced up through the center, passing off to Riise at the 30 yard line. The Norwegian international used one dribble to settle the ball and then drilled it into the net with his left foot past the outstretched feet of two defenders and Eckleman, the AV keeper. The Reds were undefeated (6-0-1) when Riise scored last season!</p>
<p>The teams continue to pressure each other, slight edge to LFC, but nothing too serious as the 70th minute is reached and AV's Staunton gets a yellow for a kick to Diouf's calf that puts the striker on the ground. Owen disappointed in the 79th with a chance to put the ball in on a penalty shot that Enckelman barely deflected with his right foot and at the next stoppage Owen is pulled for Heskey.</p>
<p>The Reds had the best defense in the Premiership last season and show they intend to repeat that statistic this season as they allowed Aston Villa almost no decent chances to score. Very good signs were the return from injury of Danny Murphy and Steven Gerrard; indeed Gerrard was named 'man of the match' on <a href="http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/match/last_match/match_report/" title="this link is likely to be stale by 8/24/02">the LFC website</a>. Next up is a home match against Southampton on Saturday. The team lost and drew in two tries against Southampton last season and this is one team they need to improve against to move up from last year's second place.</p>
