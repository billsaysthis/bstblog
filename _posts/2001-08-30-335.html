<p><b>Today's movie: Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</b></p>
<p>Some people may dismiss <a href="http://newsaskew.com/va5/new.shtml">Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</a> as sexist, juvenile, gay-baiting, potty mouth humor. And they'd be right. Except that it's really funny and all the political incorrectness is self-mocking. Jay and Silent Bob are finally starring in their own movie after being supporting characters in writer/director Kevin Smith's four previous gutbusters. Since Smith has announced this is his last 'New Jersey' film, he brings back many of the old characters--Ben Affleck plays himself (with Matt Damon and director Gus Van Sant parodying Good Willing Hunting) as well as his Chasing Amy cartoonist, Jason Lee reprises his roles from Mall Rats and Chasing Amy, even Shannon Doherty and Joey Lauren Adams. And Jason Mewes as Jay is all over the place with the machine gun cursing/sexual fantasy raps and director Smith as Silent Bob.</p>
<p>On the other hand, can someone please tell <a href="http://newsaskew.com/va5/wilenholly.shtml">Will Ferrell</a> to take a vacation? The man is in more more movies than I can count and he stinks in all of them</p>
<p>But not <a href="http://us.imdb.com/EGallery?source=granitz&amp;group=1110&amp;photo=elizabeth_shannon4&amp;path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Elizabeth,+Shannon">Shannen Elizabeth</a>. She falls for Jay, somehow, after throwing over her international ring of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/EGallery?source=ss&amp;group=0261392&amp;photo=AU21_1_02.jpg&amp;path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Elizabeth,+Shannon">extremely hot female jewel thieves</a> for him.</p>
<p>Moviefone (yeah, the place you look up showtimes) has a good feature explaining the <a href="http://www.moviefone.com/features/feature.adp?_dci_s_p=movie&amp;_dci_p_c=0&amp;_dci_s_a=showtimes&amp;_dci_s_b=newmoviefone&amp;_dci_s_c=sanfrancisco&amp;movieid=9876&amp;id=998341091%2c0&amp;_dci_e_t=p&amp;_dci_l_n=mflnk%2efeatures%2efeature%2eid%2d998341091%2c0&amp;_dci_tm=999132556&amp;_dci_l_a=12161&amp;_dci_p_n=mf%5falso7&amp;_dci_l_c=0&amp;date=20010829&amp;_dci_p_a=12161&amp;_dci_p_b=mf%5fl1%2eshowtimes%2emovie%2epage%2dmain%2estudioid%2d2005%2emovieid%2d9876">characters in Kevin Smith's universe</a>. And there's the obligatory <a href="http://www.viewaskew.com/newboard/messages287/521.html">interest group controversy</a>, this time with the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.</p>
