<p>Just finished reading <a href="http://www.baen.com/chapters/W200401/0743471792.htm?blurb">Freehold</a> by <a href="http://www.michaelzwilliamson.com/">Michael Z. Williamson</a> and stumbled on <a href="http://www.sfreviews.net/freehold.html">this review</a>. Pretty much elaborates what I think about it though overall I seem to have enjoyed the book more than this guy. Short take: Very good writing but 2/3rds of the first 300 pages should have been edited out; on the other hand, after those 300 pages are finished, I read the last 350 in one day.<br /></p>
