<p><b>Not an energetic weekend</b>
<p>A laidback weekend due to illness and lethergy but I did get out with a friend and her daughter to see Disney's new flick <a href="http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/recess/flash/index.html">Recess: School's Out</a> which had a reasonable story and animation. Also caught a little of the NCAA tourney; only two big disappointments--North Carolina lost to Penn St. and (F)UCLA won. <a href="www.usc.edu">Go Trojans</a>, and wouldn't that be a monumental set of upsets!</p>
