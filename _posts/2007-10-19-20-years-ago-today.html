<p>It was the first day of my (first) honeymoon, in Aruba. I was working for a long-defunct commercial real estate finance company and just a few months out of B School. At lunchtime I noticed a local four page newspaper at the front desk, hot off the presses, with a big headline about how the Dow Jones was already down more than 400 points after only a couple of trading hours.</p>
<p>Wow, huh? Talk about the right day to be out of the office and out of the country! Even now I can't quite picture the misery that must have been going on back in the office. Pretty serious though; even a week later on my return everyone was still in a black mood.</p>
