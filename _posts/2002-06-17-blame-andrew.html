<p>One of the biggest disasters in American corporate history, thousands out of work, companies destroyed, a few people dead, just so former Enron CFO Andew Fastow could <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/17/business/17ENRO.html">avoid losing a little money</a>. Apparently it will take some very subtle and sophisticated prosecution to hold Fastow accountable but may be able to put him in jail. He's not the only one who deserves jail time but I sure would be happy to see him go in for awhile. As one Anderson exec, who was not part of the scandal, put it: "In effect it was, heads I win, tails you lose."</p>
