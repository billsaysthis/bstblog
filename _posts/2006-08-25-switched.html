<p>So the MacBook came yesterday morning and I'm having a fun struggle getting everything moved, new software installed and all of the dfferences learned. Some of it is easier than others, but I have a cadre of personal tech support to see me through. You know who you are.</p>
<p>I think I need to print out the keystroke command cheat sheet because the differences are the most annoying aspect of the changeover. My fingers' memories are simply entrenched after 15 years of using Windows!</p>
<p>Blogger doesn't work 100% in Safari either, missing the rich text edit control the team made such a big deal over when they announced it for IE and Firefox. I tried Camino, a supposedly Macified Firefox, but it doesn't support Firefox extensions and may yet give Flock a shot after the next update.</p>
<p>Some of the apps I've downloaded don't seem to work as I expected. They start, show up bouncing in the Dock, and then just sit there doing nothing. I'm sure its my misunderstanding but that doesn't help me.</p>
<p>If it doesn't kill you it makes you stronger.</p>
