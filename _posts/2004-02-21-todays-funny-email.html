<p>I quote exactly for your entertainment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi William,</p>
<p>Don't know if you ended up with any Google stock out of the deal where Pyra sold to Google.   I am actively working to buy stock from current and former Google employees.</p>
<p>We have a legal contract authored by one of the lead legal firms in Palo Alto.</p>
<p>It allows us to pay you now for stock which would get transferred to us after a liquidity event occurs.   In addition the agreement allows you to participate on the upside of the stocks appreciation after an IPO.</p>
<p>If you are interested in getting money now for your stock, please contact me.</p></blockquote>
<p>To save the author embarrasment and me any potential harassment I will leave the writer's name and info off this post. However, I cannot imagine anyone stupid enough to take a deal like this unless they are desparate for money (for which there are probably better solutions) or the offer is a lot higher than I can imagine it is.</p>
