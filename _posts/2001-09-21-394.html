<p><b>Winning the story war</b></p>
<p>Thomas Friedman, in another excellent NY Times column, explains the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/21/opinion/21FRIE.html">Hama Rules</a> that apply in many of the Arab nations. Hama is a town in Syria that, nearly 20 years ago, was home to an Islamic fundamentalist rebellion against the Assad dictatorship. Please note that an Assad still runs Syria and the city of Hamas literally no longer exists.</p>
