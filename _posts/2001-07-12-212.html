<p><b>Mob's greatest hits: awards keep coming</b><br />

<p>The nominations are out and for a second year running, The Sopranos lead the hunt with <a href="http://mrshowbiz.go.com/news/2001/7/emmynominations071201.html">22 mominations</a>. Bruce Springsteen's HBO Special got six nominations as well. Gandolfini, Falco, Bracco, Chianese (Uncle Junior), Imperioli (Christopher), and Aida Turturro all got nods. I guess it's too soon but I can't find a complete list of the nominations yet.</p>
