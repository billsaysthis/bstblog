<p>For a new programming project I decided to see what the whole CSS framework and grid design craze is about for myself, and to refresh my Ruby on Rails programming skills.</p>
<p><span style="float:left;margin-right:6px;"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/compass.png" alt="Compass" /></span>A little research turned up Chris Eppstein's <a href="https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass/tree" title="">Compass gem</a>. This is a very nice meta-framework, which can be used with Rails, Merb, Sinatra or other Ruby frameworks as well as pure Ruby, that combines Hampton Caitlin's <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/docs/rdoc/classes/Sass.html" title="">SASS gem</a> with any of several CSS frameworks, including (at this writing) <a href="http://blueprintcss.org/" title="">Blueprint</a>, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids" title="">Yahoo! UI Grids</a> and <a href="http://960.gs/" title="">960 Grid System</a>. Blueprint seemed sufficient for my needs and the easiest choice so I went with it.</p>
<p>Author's note: I tried publishing this with Blogger as a regular post but it just wasn't working, so its available as <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/content/compass-blueprint-rails.php">a standalone page</a>.</p>
