<p>In a unanimous decision today, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/19/national/19CND-SCHOOL.html">kids can be embarrassed in class without opening the school to a lawsuit</a>. Thankfully this case didn't churn up on politics! A mother in Tulsa was pissed one (or more) of her kids was embarrassed in front of a classroom by having a quiz or piece of homework graded by another student--the kids swapped papers and graded each other based on answers from the teacher. What a horrific life experience for the child. Looking for anyway to get back at the school, she grasped on a federal law that prevents any school records form being released without parental consent. Her lawyers argued that by grading the papers, the students all became agents of the school and therefore subject to the law. What really drives me up the wall is that the mother who sued, or whoever was footing the bill here, was willing to spend the money to take the case to the highest court in the land. Of course, the school district had to spend money too, which now will not be available for something useful such as actually educating the children.</p>
