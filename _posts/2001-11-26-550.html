<p><strong>More egoboo: My letter gets published</strong></p>
<p>Recently I wrote <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_11_18_blog_archive.phtml#7348535">an entry disagreeing</a> with Gale Norton's column claiming that drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is an important national security issue. In short, I argue that America is better off in a national security sense (putting aside ecological issues for discussion purposes) preserving our own portion of the finite supply of oil until others have exhausted theirs; instead the real shortterm drilling interest is oil industry profits. I also sent a slight variant as a letter to the editor of the San Jose Mercury News, where I read the column, and <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/premium/opinion/letters/letters26.htm">they published it</a>. Due to the paper's shortsighted web policies, the letter is unlikely to be available after 12/2/01 and for some reason the <a href="http://www.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> doesn't archive the newspaper's site. Still, I love seeing my name on paper even if the boost is <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=illusory">illusory</a>.</p>
