<p>We were out tonight taste testing the new low carb wraps at Quizno's (not bad) and arranging a tuxedo rental at Men's Wearhouse (silver tie and vest) and ran into one of those things that make you go "Huh?" on the drive home. Traffic on El Camino Real, the most major of thoroughfares in the South Bay/Peninsula, was slowing to a crawl and looking up ahead showed why.</p>
<p>There was water gushing 30 or 40 feet up into the air on one side of the road past the next traffic light and cars were being merged to the left to avoid the police cars and fire trucks. I didn't think this was so bad, people were moving smartly, but then I got up close to see the details and here you go: the valve to shut off this main was in the middle lane of three lanes on our side of El Camino.</p>
<p>That's right. The geniuses who built our water pipeline system put the shutoff for a main in the middle of the biggest road in two counties. Tell me, how smart is that?</p>
