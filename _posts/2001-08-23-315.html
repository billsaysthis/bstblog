<p><b>Definite weirdness 2</b><br />

<p>Humorous prank piece or serious effort? People do some <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/08/20010816-3.html">strange things</a> and it can be difficult to tell when someone is <a href="http://www.theonion.com">joking</a>, at least for me. So when I saw <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/wd-news/article/0,,10_870221,00.html">Working on a Unified Code for 'LOL' or :)</a>, I wasn't sure at first. Do we really need an XML standard for emoticons? But this story appears in press release form on the <a href="http://oasis-open.org/news/oasis_news_08_21_01.shtml">OASIS website</a> so I'm guessing Ranjeeth Kumar Thunga, chair of the technical committee, is serious and for real.</p>
