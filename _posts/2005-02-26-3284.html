<p>Sure to be linked from every far corner of the blogosphere: John Heilemann's lengthy, somewhat bloated and yet still insightful <em>GQ</em> feature on <a href="http://men.style.com/gq/features/full?id=content_422">the personalities running Google</a>. Mainly covering the periods around the 1999 initial venture funding and the 2004 IPO. Should have either been edited for length or bolstered with a lot more content but the author does have more than enough insider interviews to make for an interesting piece.
