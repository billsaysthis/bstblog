<p><b>How much is your brain worth?</b><br />

<p>Most people are probably cautious when it comes to protecting the muscle inside their skull. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/players/profile?statsId=88">Eric Lindros</a>, unquestionably a great hockey player, missed the past season after suffering the sixth concussion of his career. Another one and he could lose, literally, some of his mind. But ESPN is reporting that he still wants to make a comeback and the Flyers (who own his rights) <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/news/2001/0813/1238877.html">are talking with the Rangers</a> about a trade. I realize Lindros will likely make more than $9 million per year for four to six years with a new contract but is the money really worth the risk?</p>
<p>Other star players have made the other, more difficult choice to retire. <a href="http://www.allstarz.org/steveyoung/career.htm">Steve Young</a> and <a href="http://www.aikman.com/troy2.html">Troy Aikman</a>, both of whom would probably have made Lindros-class money, decided to retire rather than risk further damage. Making their decisions a little easier was that both knew they would make the move directly into well-paying TV gigs but I have to wonder if Lindros is prepared to take the consequences.</p>
