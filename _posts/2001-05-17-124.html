<p><b>Star Trek X: Interview with writer John Logan</b><br />

<p>Although it's release is at least a year away (and perhaps further if we get an actors strike and scheduling conflicts with the next Star Wars), I was highly gratified to read Star Trek: The Magazine's interview with <a href="http://www.voyagersdelights.com/john_logan.htm">John Logan</a>. Logan previously wrote the scripts for <a href="http://www.gladiator-thefilm.com/" title="he got an Oscar nomination for this script">Gladiator</a> and the Oliver Stone/Al Pacino flick <a href="http://anygivensunday.warnerbros.com/index-new.html">Any Given Sunday</a>, which is big plus numero uno, and he's a huge, lifelong Star Tek fan, plus numero dos. Without giving away much in the way of plot, he goes into great detail about what's important to him, how he's developing the screenplay, and how excited he is to be doing the writing.</p>
<p>Small world at work: Logan got involved because a friend of his was doing the play '1776' with <a href="http://www.starseeker.com/actors/actors_s/spiner_b.htm" title="the redoubtable Mr. Data">Brent Spiner</a> and hooked them up for dinner.</p>
