<p>There is (and has been) a bug in the Blogger RSS generation engine for the past two weeks or so, which causes the engine to ignore any line breaks. I filed a support ticket and was assured it was being looked at, but there has been no change or visible progress since. I mention this now because I see that the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_08_03_blog_archive.phtml#105995582900787256">previous entry</a> looks even stranger in my RSS reader.</p>
