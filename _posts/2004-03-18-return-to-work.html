<p>As you may have surmised from the subject, my long and tiresome hunt was not endless, even though I probably complained, cajoled and kvetched enough to make it seem that way.</p>
<p>I have been accepted a contract position as product manager at a company here in the Valley called <a href="http://www.intransa.com">Intransa</a>. They make a very serious enterprise class storage system (for the non-techies among you, that means a really big hard disk system) and are a spin out from the big networking company 3Com. If all goes well--if I perform, that is--I should become a regular employee in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>Seriously, I want to thank all of you out there in the webworld for the help, advice and encouragement you've given over a very difficult two and a half years. This has meant a lot to me! How did I get this job, you ask? Networking! Seems that what everybody's saying is true, when you want/need a new job get out there and talk to everyone you know and everyone they know.</p>
<p>Somehow I will adjust to the hardships of workday life. Ouch! Good thing I got caught up on all those old TV series while I had the chance. LOL</p>
