<p><a href="http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/entry/2005/03/18#2509">Rogers Cadenhead said</a>: <em>"They are admittedly a largely white and male group, but I assuage my liberal guilt by linking often to <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/">Bill Lazar</a>, who as you may not realize is a transgendered teen-aged Cuban-American evangelical whose mother was a notch baby."</em></p>
<p>Now Rogers has always seemed like a nice enough guy to me and so where he came up with this terrible filthy slander I have no idea. But I like it, totally, I was laughing out loud so hard that my wife came running over to see what was wrong. Paralyzed with hysterics, all I could do was point to the screen.</p>
<p>My preference is to stay away from blogging tempests in teapots, as I have until now on this one, but I think the whole argument is hooey. If you look at the main page blogroll on this site, at least as of when I'm writing, there are 13 personal blogs. Four are written by women, three of whom are white, the other nine by white males. I do have a link to Oliver Willis's Brand Democrat up above in the semi-political section and he's a person of color, though male as far as I know.</p>
<p>You know what? So what. Has no bearing at all on my attitudes about how people ought to relate to and deal with each other. Search the zillion and one gay marriage threads sometime on MetaFilter  for my username, billsaysthis, and you'll get a much more useful answer than a blogroll. Search this site for the phrase Bushinations.</p>
<p>Rogers hit it on the head. I've been hiding behind this middle aged Jewish facade for too long. The real me is yearning to be set free, and TS1 is in a panic. Too far from anything she's dealt with before.</p>
<p>But Rogers, how come you haven't come out yourself? Easy to point the finger at this little transgendered Cubano to hide that spaceship in your second bedroom. That's right, folks, Rogers Cadenhead is an alien here to prepare us for the ranchers--Soylent Green is people and Rogers and his friends are going to eat us all.</p>
