<p>Since <a href="http://www.rawsugar.com/myaccount/4myWeb" title="You need to be logged in to RawSugar for this link to really work">our WordPress plugin</a> is finally available (but with an update due in a few days!), the timing of the <a href="http://2006.wordcamp.org/">informal WordPress gathering</a> is great. I'm writing just after the lunch break and so far the day has been pretty cool.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/thepartycow/207347315/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/207347315_62245711be_m.jpg" alt="Me pontificating" height="200" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Quick Highlights</span>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://skeltoac.com">Andy Skelton</a> (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/laughingsquid/207283875/">photo</a>) opened the day with a session on widgets, which I took advantage of to push RawSugar (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/laughingsquid/207356476/">photo</a>)</li>
<li>GoodStorm showed their innovative <a href="http://mecommerce.goodstorm.com/">embedded ecommerce plugin</a></li>
<li><a href="http://chartreuse.wordpress.com/">Prince Campbell</a> (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/laughingsquid/207357084/" title="Note his bodyguard">not the singer</a>) lead a discussion on techniques for writing a compelling blog</li>
<li><a href="http://erichaller.com">Eric Haller</a> gave us an acoustic musical interlude (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/laughingsquid/207452415/">photo</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://photomatt.net">Matt M.</a> did a state of the Word session, ending with a bunch of Q&amp;A and suggestions for improving WordPress and the surrounding community sites (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/laughingsquid/207283820/">photo</a>).</li>
<li><a href="http://goodcommerce.com">Yobie Benjamin</a> and <a href="http://conversionrater.com">Pat McCarthy</a> are leading a very meaty session on monetizing blogs (another chance to push RS ;)</li>
<li><a href="http://txfx.net/">Mark Jaquith</a> is leading the most voted for session, using WP as a CMS</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Lowlight:</span> Lunch was also very meaty, a BBQ buffet, and so not at all vegetarian-friendly. I walked around the corner and got a veg burrito. On the silverlining side, coming back I ran into <a href="http://www.dentedreality.com.au/notes/">Beau</a>, who I haven't seen since the fall, and had a chance to catch up as we went for a coffee.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/thepartycow/207438871/">Scott Beale</a> is here taking many photos, as he always does--he was even doing it up at Gnomedex!</p>
