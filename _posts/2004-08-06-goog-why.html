<p>A lot of the crap surrounding the Google IPO confuses me. I think Brin and Page's not just shareholders first operating plan is fine, even an understandable attempt at running a corporation in a different and potentially better way. But the distinctly negative way the company is talking to potential investors and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43936-2004Aug5.html">treating them</a> is still strange. Clearly there are plenty of people willing to invest on the specified terms but every time I turn around some bit of news comes out to make the concept even worse. Got to admit that I'm not at all interested in getting in on the IPO.<br /></p>
