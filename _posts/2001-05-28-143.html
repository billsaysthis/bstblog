<p><b>Today's Book: Batman - No Man's Land</b><br />

<p>Gotham City has been hit by a major earthquake and two rounds of epidemic disease, then cut off from the rest of the U.S. by political decree proclaiming it a No Man's Land, and the Batman is missing in action. That's where Greg Rucka starts us in <a href="http://www.simonsays.com/book/default_book.cfm?isbn=0671774557">No Man's Land</a>. He does a good job in building the tension in the decimated city with Joker, Two Face, Black Mask, Bane, Penguin, and even Lex Luther (minus Superman). Our hero has Robin, Nightwing, Oracle, a new Batgirl, and Commissioner Jim Gordon on his side as he roams the night protecting and reclaiming the turf.</p>
<p>Big Bat fans will probably also want to check out DC Comic's <a href="http://www.batman.com/directcurrents/comics/Jul04/jslbm1.html">re-imagining of the Caped Crusader</a> by Stan Lee</p>
