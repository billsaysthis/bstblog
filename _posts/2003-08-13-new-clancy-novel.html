<p>In his last few novels, bestselling author Tom Clancy has suffered from what many called verbal diarrhea. He also seemed to have run out of steam with Jack Ryan, going back to tell a tale from the early days in his last book. With <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/039915079X/httpwwwbillsc-20" title="Buy it at Amazon?">The Teeth of the Tiger</a>, just out, Clancy looks to have reinvented his career: the novel is less than 500 pages and, though it works within the established milieu, focuses on a new cast of characters.</p>
