<p>I am fat. I have eaten many <a href="http://www.nabiscoworld.com/chipsahoy/">cookies</a> and many bowls of <a href="http://www.cheerios.com/about/honeynut.asp">cereal</a> in my nearly 42 years on this planet. But I have never considered suing Nabisco or General Mills. Eating this food was, more or less, my choice. So I'm not surprised or disappointed that the judge in New York threw out the lawsuit filed by a few obese people against McDonalds. What an amazing lack of personal responsibility these people and their sleazy lawyer!</p>
<p>Of course I'm also finally taking my <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=1202visit&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=smilingdad_bill.jpg">body</a> seriously and have adopted an appropriate <a href="http://www.atkinscenter.com">diet</a> and exercise regime. I've lost about 35 pounds since Labor Day and workout at 24 Fitness four or five times a week. I won't be suing anyone, much as I would love to have a lottery-like payoff. My body, my life, my choice.</p>
