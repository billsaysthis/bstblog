<p>In homage to <a href="http://www.pamslife.com/2004_10_01_archives.html#109846738177076629">Pam's Pumpkin Stew</a> (also known as Carbonada en Zapallo), I'm making this Atkins-provided <a href="http://atkins.com/food/recipes/all/Lamb_and_Vegetable_Stew.html">Lamb and Vegetable Stew</a> tonight. After the eating, I will note that the recipe could benefit from the addition of a bit more seasoning and also that I only used 1.5 pounds of meat.<br /></p>
