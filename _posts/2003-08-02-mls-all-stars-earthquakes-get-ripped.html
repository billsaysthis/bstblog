<p>How is it that out of <a href="http://www.foxsportsworld.com/content/view?contentId=579588">18 players</a> named for today's MLS All-Star side, only one plays for the tops in the league San Jose Earthquakes? That one player--Landon Donovan--was chosen for name recognition, not his current play since he's missed almost half the games playing for the US National Team; to add insult, Donovan isn't even in the starting team. Pat Onstad, the Quakes goalie, leads the league statistically and in wins but instead Kevin Hartman of the host LA Galaxy was chosen. For that matter five Galaxy players were chosen even though the team is in fourth place in the Western Conference. Earthquake players like leading scorer Brian Mullan and emotional and defensive leader Jeff Agoos were told not to bother coming. I don't think people should wonder why, despite taking the title in 2001 and running at the top all year long, San Jose draws an average of only 7,500 spectators per game.</p>
<p>Donovan came on for the beginning of the second half (I'm writing this just as the half starts). One reason there are so few players on the MLS squad is because instead of two teams (East-West or US-World as in the past), one squad was named and are playing against Chivas de Guadalajara, a top Mexican team. The game is not being played as a friendly exhibition, though, with lots of scoring and little defense. Chivas starts their season Tuesday and is using this as a final tuneup while most players on both sides are treating this as a proxy Mexico-America battle. The commentators can't stop reminding us that Chivas is the most Mexican of Mexican clubs, having never used a player not born in their nation. Anyway, this the first MLS All-Star game where more yellow cards were given than goals (2-nil) and the quality is pretty decent.</p>
<p>Another reason that Chivas is the opposition today--don't get me wrong, I like the idea of it--is because MLS is planning to expand back to 12 teams the season after next and Chivas will operate one of the two new teams. Not sure where this team will be located yet (Phoenix? San Antonio?) but having some new blood in the management ranks can only be helpful since currently more than half the teams are operated by one group (Anschutz Entertainment Group runs San Jose, plus the Colorado Rapids, Chicago Fire, Los Angeles Galaxy, D.C. United and NJ MetroStars).</p>
<p>Still, the Earthquakes got shafted and this needs to be fixed for next year. When the MLS side finally opened the scoring about 10 minutes into the second half, who was responsible? Landon Donovan, of course, with an absolutely beautiful steal at the top of the box and smooth move to juke the keeper out of position so that his pass to Ante Razov was sure to find net.</p>
