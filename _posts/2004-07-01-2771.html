<p>I picked up my new glasses late this afternoon. They are very stylish, or so I'm told, from Dolce and Gabbana, but for the first time I needed progressive lenses. The doctor wasn't kidding when he told me I would have an adjustment period! Damn but these are annoying and the improved vision better be worth it in the end.</p>
