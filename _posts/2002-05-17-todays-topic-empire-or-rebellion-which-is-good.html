<p>An interesting essay by Jonathan V. Last on why, contrary to common perception, the <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/001/248ipzbt.asp">Empire is good</a> and the Rebellion bad. The author even accounts for the destruction of Alderaan! (Note: the essay does not review or spoil the new movie in this article.)</p>
<p><em>Dad says</em>: Many comparisons may be made with the Bush administration, in terms of "just wanting order" and a return to fundamental Christian values.</p>
