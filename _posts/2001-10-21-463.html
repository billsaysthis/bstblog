<p><b>Tonight's movie: Bandits</b></p>
<p>Director Barry Levinson recaptures his comedic touch in <a href="http://www.mgm.com/bandits/">Bandits</a>, a story of love, money, and brotherhood. <a href="http://archive.nandotimes.com/ourcentury/cnremember/story/body/0,3343,66039-104603-662506-0-nandotimes,00.html">Levinson</a> blew me away with his debut film <a href="http://www.ravecentral.com/diner.html">Diner</a>, which he wroted and directed, following up with a string of majors: The Natural, Tin Men, Good Morning, Vietnam, and Rainman. Then he turned to mostly dramatic movies in the '90s: Avalon, Bugsy, Disclosure, Sleepers, Sphere (why was Levinson directing an SF flick?) and Liberty Heights, and he was trying, I suppose, to be a serious filmmaker but he's best at comedy. Even in the '90s he slipped in Wag the Dog.</p>
<p>Bandits gives us Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton as escaped convicts who go on a bank robbery spree and pick up neglected but housewife <a href="http://pluto.spaceports.com/~cate/">Cate Blanchett</a>, who falls in love with both of them, along the way. There's a surprising ending. But the film was just hilarious. Willis is great at these adult comedies (as in The Whole Nine Yards), Thornton is swell as the smart <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=hypochondriac">hypochondriac</a>, and Blanchett is funny and totally radiant, bringing nice depth to her character as the relationship between the three evolves. The first shot of her, as she screws in a blue light bulb, is gorgeous, amazingly well-suited to her <a href="http://pluto.spaceports.com/~cate/gallery/unscripted/images/MISC/005.jpg">coloring</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bobbyslayton.com/">Bobby Slayton</a>, one of the funnier standups around today, does a nice supporting turn as the host of a true crime TV show, which Levinson uses as a framing device for the movie.</p>
