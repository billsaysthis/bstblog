<p>Yesterday I went to the Krugle office to meet Steve Larsen and Mel Badgett, respectively the CEO and VP Product Management, for coffee--and to pick up my <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2006_07_16_blog_archive.phtml#115319551473806172">iPod</a>--and we had a really great chat. Their <a href="http://www.krugle.com">open source code search engine</a> is pretty early days but already <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2006_07_09_blog_archive.phtml#115276457667942302">delivers the goods</a>.</p>
<p>One thing I really appreciated was how interested Steve and Mel were in my feedback. Not surprisingly a few of them are already in the works, like an Eclipse plugin, but Mel was taking copious notes. I try to do the same when speaking with people using RawSugar and hopefully do as good a job.</p>
<p>We also looked at <a href="http://www.rawsugar.com/search">RawSugar</a> and I was glad to see that both were impressed with a number of our features including the powerful multi-level tagging system, that tag auto-complete works in every field where one can type in a tag, and that advanced search help is available right next to the search field (but one click away). So it was a two way exchange.</p>
<p>The Nano is black, if you're curious. I never had one, or really looked that closely at them, before and the reputation Apple has for designing every part of the experience definitely came through. Even in the packaging: the plastic wrapping of the iPod itself, for instance, had a small unglued tab so removing it was smooth and easy. Didn't need to use scissors except for the shrinkwrap the box itself was in or tear any wrapping other than the packet containing the foam cover for the ear buds. How did Steve miss that one?</p>
<p>Now of course I have to explore the humongous world of iPod accessories. Any of you care to <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/contact.phtml?sub=iPod%20Favorites">share favorites</a>?</p>
