<p>12 days ago, I <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_03_31_blog_archive.phtml#75080707">wrote</a> about my inability to get any love from the IRS. The agent I spoke with that day assured me a check would be cut in a week and mailed that same day (April 12). USPS is not that great but usually first class mail will be delivered to me from anywhere in the country within two business days. It's been four but no check for Bill. Instead, I get a letter from the Dread Crew, dated and mailed April 15, explaining that my bank had refused the direct deposit and I should expect a check within three weeks.</p>
<p>I call up and sit on hold for nearly a half hour, thankfully I have a phone headset, and am finally connected to a live agent. Who insists that my bank must have refused the direct deposit because why would the IRS lie to me? Um, yeah, okay. He does say that the computer shows a check was cut and mailed to me for the refund on April 12 as promised. But it comes from a different processing center, so it could take up the THREE WEEKS to make its way to my mailbox.</p>
<p>If I don't like his answers or explanations? The agent suggests I consult an attorney and file a lawsuit. Would I get my money any faster? No. Would I get any more money? No. I might get the truth, though, he says. So I should spend my own money (and yours too) getting my own government to tell me the truth? I think this guy must get driven insane answering these beyond his control questions but there has to be a better way. IAC, I still want my Benjamins!</p>
