<p><strong>Making money on the Internet</strong></p>
<p>For almost everyone except eBay and PayPal, making money on the Internet has been beyond elusive. Even Yahoo!, which turned small profits in a few quarters, is searching for revenue beyond the banner and popunder advertising markets. One new twist, which shows someone is thinking, is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml?type=internetnews&amp;StoryID=457182">selling analysis of search queries</a>. Their new <a href="http://buzz.yahoo.com/">Buzz</a> service, a basic version of which is freely available, scores the percentage of Yahoo! users searching for that subject on a given day, multiplied by a constant to make the number easier to read. Useful for market research, Buzz looks like a smart way for Yahoo! to make more out what is has.</p>
