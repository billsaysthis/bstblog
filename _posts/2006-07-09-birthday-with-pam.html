<p>My <a href="http://www.pamslife.com/">wonderful friend Pam</a> is turning mumblety-mum years old Monday so TS1 and I met up with another couple, her and  her husband Henry tonight for dinner at <a href="http://www.thevillagebistro.net/">VILLAGE California Bistro and Wine Bar</a> in Santana Row. We had a terrific time and a pretty good, albeit expensive, meal.</p>
<p>Since neither of us had been to this fancy new development before we decided to go a little early and explore. I even picked up my first Moleskin notebook at the Borders, since Garret and others wrote so favorably of them.</p>
<p>Santana Row is an upscale integrated development, stores and restaurants on the ground level and housing on top. How upscale? Let's just say that the Mercedes, Lexii and Porsches complimented the Ferraris and the stores strongly reminded me of Madison Avenue in Manhattan.</p>
<p>No surprise then that the restaurant was a bit above our normal range. We really enjoyed the food, spring asparagus with goat cheese and vinagrette, risotto with mushrooms and banana split (with carmelized banana, chocolate and caramel sauces made in the kitchen). And the company, of course.</p>
<p>That reminds me. Have you checked out <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/pamelashane">her CD</a> yet? Eight lovely songs she wrote, sings and plays (piano, with a studio band) for a measley $12.97. Buy yourself a copy and make her birthday even happier ;)</p>
