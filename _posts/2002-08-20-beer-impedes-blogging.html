<p>Had a Heineken this afternoon, after a homeowners association/contractor manager fell through because the contractor forgot the meeting, and that is making me feel like not blogging just now. Plus, the huge fire at Santana Row is hypnotizing me. Plus, I was at the dentist before this and she had to apply a topical anesthetic. So drowsy!</p>
