<p>According to the NY Times, former Jacksonville (and Parcells-era Giants assistant) Tom Coughlin <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/sports/AP-FBN-Giants-Coughlin.html">has been hired</a> as the new head coach of the New York Giants, replacing Jim Fassell. Coughlin, known as a very strict leader in eight seasons with the Jaguars, gets a four-year contract worth more than $11 million. Interesting, if predictable, choice and a decent way to start off the new year. The team also interviewed Romeo Crennel and Lovie Smith and I do think it'll be a shame if all seven openings get filled without those two getting jobs.</p>
