<p>Indeed, <a href="http://www.bettychen.com/PropertyDetails?show_address=yes&amp;show_description=yes&amp;show_virtual_tour=yes&amp;pid=530996&amp;ls=REIL&amp;presented_by=yes">Casa de Lazar</a> is available for viewing with an eye towards purchase by reasonably deep-pocketed individuals and small families. You'll be living in a quiet part of Mountain View, about 25 minutes by foot to great downtown dining and drinking on Castro Street and access to light rail/CalTrain and all the major highways without being in noise range. A lot of nice people in the other homes in the small HOA, quite a few who've lived here for over a decade. Open house this Saturday and Sunday afternoons. Or call <a href="http://www.bettychen.com/">Betty Chen</a> at (408) 394-3409. Bid high.</p>
