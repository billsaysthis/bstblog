<p><b>American Record Industry: Fascists at heart</b></p>
<p>I feel really strange calling an entire industry, particularly one I wanted to work in when I was younger, fascist. However, as an old friend points out on O'ReillyNet (<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/767">RIAA Threatened By Anti-Terrorist Law</a>), the Recording Industry Association of America is really pathetic. Not to mention <a href="http://denbeste.nu/entries/00001099.shtml">stupid</a> and fascist. They want to send out a virus that erases files on our computers, whether they're there legally or not, and they want Congress to pass a law that says this is okay. As <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/10/15#l39c40bc2fbf5880841a8afb660193389">Dave says</a>, let's cut off their air supply by just not buying their product. <a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/">Bruce</a>, I love you baby, but I can't stand the company you keep.</p>
