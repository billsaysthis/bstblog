<p>According to Rolling Stone, <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/9368434/dylan_springsteen_prep_new_cds">Springsteen is recording</a> a new CD to be released this May called <em>The Seeger Sessions</em>, a tribute to folk grand master <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger">Pete Seeger</a>. Again laying aside his electric guitar and backing band, this album feature acoustic guitar, banjo, mandolin and violin and will be the first to consist of songs not written by Bruce. Instead he covers the now 86 year old Seeger's classic compositions and other traditional American folk. While I support an artist's right to make the music which makes him happy, and though I'll surely buy a copy, I don't think this will reach even the modest sales of <span style="font-style:italic;">Devils and Dust</span>.</p>
