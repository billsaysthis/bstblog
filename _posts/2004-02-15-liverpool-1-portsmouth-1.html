<p>Man, I am <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=139023&amp;cc=5901">sooo more than ready</a> for Milan Baros to get back on the field for the Reds! Despite what <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/headlinenews?id=290956&amp;cc=5901">some articles</a> suggested, he didn't play in today's FA Cup meeting but I sure hope this next week off will be it and next Sunday will see his return to action (note: clubs are off this midweek as the European national sides play friendlies to begin their Euro2004 warmup campaigns).</p>
<p>Michael Owen may have scored his 150th goal for the club but that was barely into the second minute and then 'Pool went 90 minutes without getting closer to the back of the net than the crossbar despite dominating the play and possession. A clean sheet would have been lovely but one cannot blame the keeper when he limits the (bottom dwelling) opposition to one score! In a quirk of the schedule, the same two teams were to have matched up next Saturday for a regular season clash and therefore with the replay three consecutive times but that game appears to have been postponed in favor of the replay to be held Sunday.</p>
