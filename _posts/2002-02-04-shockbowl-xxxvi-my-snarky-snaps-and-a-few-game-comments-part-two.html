<li>mlife: Stomachs, we all got them but some are cuter than others. And hey, it's ATT after all.<br />
</li>
<li>Budweiser how ya doing: funny/not funny<br />
</li>
<li>It's like competitive ass-slapping at midfield<br />
</li>
<li>That was not pass interference, the ball has to be catchable, and I can't believe Belicheck didn't challenge the call<br />
</li>
<li>Bud Light teddy and satin: now this is what I call funny!<br />
</li>
<li>40 Days and 40 Nights: Scary Movie 2 was not this stupid<br />
</li>
<li>Hotjobs.com: okay but I am not sold<br />
</li>
<li>Patriots defense is beginning to make a believer of me; I thought the Rams were on the move for a score before the sack and blocked pass to get back in the game.<br />
</li>
<li>Universal Orlando: good commercial but I'm not a theme park person<br />
</li>
<li>Subway: less fat, less humor<br />
</li>
<li>How many people are rooting for the Patriots now?<br />
</li>
<li>Austin Powers: no title but mad funny laughs, got to see this one<br />
</li>
<li>Taco Bell S class: the handheld was funny, the Mercedes latch-on isn't<br />
</li>
<li>Blockbuster: animals aren't sexy no matter how they dance<br />
</li>
<li>Cadillac Escalade: still like the song better<br />
</li>
<li>Did anyone predict the Rams would have three points after three quarters<br />
</li>
<li>Budweiser tushy: be proud parents, get over it<br />
</li>
<li>Jack in the Box: Carnivores are pretty good and check out their <a href="http://carnivoresfootball.com/stadium/stadium.shtml">stadium</a><br />
</li>
<li>4th and goal, I'd go for it, no need for a timeout to talk it over, three points does diddly for the Rams<br />
</li>
<li>Blade 2: this is exactly the kind of movie I pay $9 to see Wesley Snipes<br />
</li>
<li>M&amp;Ms hotel: cute!<br />
</li>
<li>Good choice<br />
</li>
<li>He fumbled the ball, I can't believe it! Touchdown the wrong way.<br />
</li>
<li>But a penalty gives the Rams life, they better take this gift from the gods!<br />
</li>
<li>Budweiser family: time to feel good<br />
</li>
<li>Quiznos: Geeky<br />
</li>
<li>Roche: I have no idea if this was good or bad<br />
</li>
<li>Volkswagon Turbo: not my taste in humor<br />
</li>
<li>Good play call, it's a game again and a better laugh than the VW commercial<br />
</li>
<li>Bad Company: <a href="http://www.tetranet.net/~ts64/badcompany/badcompanymain.html">good band</a>, bad <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0112443">Ellen Barkin movie</a>, but Rock and Perkins look like a big summer action movie hit<br />
</li>
<li>Bud race car: nice<br />
</li>
<li>Note: I think NASCAR, and most car racing, is about as much of a sport as boxing. Which I don't think is a sport at all.<br />
</li>
<li>Why did New England take a timeout at 4:01? They don't need to score again, just run the clock out, and how likely are the Rams to pick up a 3rd and 25? Plus it gives Warner an extra minute to get past the pain in his hand. Make it 3rd and 20 after a stupid rookie penalty.<br />
</li>
<li>Patriots gave the Rams 45 seconds of game clock with that timeout, wonder if that gift will come back to haunt them<br />
</li>
<li>Drug money supports terror. So why not <a href="http://www.hightimes.com/welcome.html">legalize drugs</a>? I bet Republican party buddies like Philip Morris and the like would appreciate the new revenue source<br />
</li>
<li>Do you go for two? I do, win now, forget OT. But Mike Martz disagreed and he's the coach. But I was right.<br />
</li>
<li>If you wanted a close game, you sure as hell got it.<br />
</li>
<li>Cadillac CTS: Finally a commercial worth selling the song rights for!</li>
</ol>
