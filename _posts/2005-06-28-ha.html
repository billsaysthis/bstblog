<p>Google's first response to the problems caused by their update last Thursday, <a href="http://buzz.blogger.com/2005/06/layout-solutions.html">Layout Solutions</a>, pretty much rates a two on a scale of 1-10 in this blogger's eyes. Very little and very late. I have yet to receive a response to my email to the support team nor has anyone from the company responded to any of the messages on either of the two user mailing lists. That old itch is flaring up again.</p>
