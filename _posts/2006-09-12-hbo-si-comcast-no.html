<p>According to HBO I should be enjoying <a href="http://www.hbo.com/apps/hodschedule/hod/details.do?FID=PMRS32491">the second episode of season 4 of The Wire</a> through their On Demand service, even though it won't be on the regular channel until next Sunday. The season premiere was ready as promised last Monday and certainly had me looking forward to seeing #2 tonight. Comcast doesn't seem to want to let me watch it though; the episode is not to be found on the OD menu.</p>
<p>Calling their customer service line is near about useless of course. Though the woman I spoke with was polite and wanted to be helpful, On Demand is run by a different group and no one in her's can do anything more than send a note over to the others.</p>
<p>I'd hate to think there's anything sinister going on at Comcast but HBO is owned by Time Warner and another Time Warner group just happens to be Comcast's biggest competitor, or at least the next biggest cable system operator in the good old USA.</p>
<p>I'm sure this was just a mistake by some individual contributor, forgetting to update the OD guide for something new and different but either way I'm still not enjoying the Monday night I had planned.</p>
