<p>I can create anxiety out of thin air<br />
<br />Don't look at the little pebbles scattered<br />
<br />Across the patio in between the shed and<br />
<br />The house, just look into my eyes.</p>
<p>Speak out loud the emotion, the action<br />
<br />You see lurking, sitting within and tell me<br />
<br />How the pebbles make the day different<br />
<br />From yesterday and yesterday's pebbles.</p>
<p>Where does the brown of the shed end?<br />
<br />Follow the color up the side and over the<br />
<br />Beam to where wood seamlessly merges<br />
<br />To the gravel and tar roofline.</p>
<p>Then you can see the pebbles scattered<br />
<br />On the roof as well; no matter how many<br />
<br />Fall to the ground from wind or after storms<br />
<br />There are still more pebbles on the roof.</p>
<p>So you can see as well then where my racing<br />
<br />Heartbeat and pounding just from the<br />
<br />Sight of these small grey pebbles,<br />
<br />Always getting under my feet.</p>
