<p>If you own a domain name, do you own the 'telephone number' version. For example google.com is <a href="466453.com">466453.com</a> and microsoft.com is <a href="642767638.com">642767638.com</a>; click on either of those and you'll see someone has been thinking ahead. Just like companies like to grab the toll-free phone number associated with their name or product, some companies have figured that for a few bucks a year they might as well do the same based on a telephone keypad. But I just can't see shelling out the $15 or so per year for <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com">245572978447.com</a>.</p>
