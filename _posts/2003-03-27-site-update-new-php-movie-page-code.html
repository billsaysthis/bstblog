<p>I realize that this amazing news will not thrill all that many people but if Adam can <a href="http://theflangynews.editthispage.com/2003/03/25">blather about</a> his Python play and hey, it makes me happy...</p>
<p>I wrote some brand new PHP code for idsplaying the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/entertain/movies2004.phtml">movie page for 2004+</a>. Up until now, and still for the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/entertain/movies2003.phtml">2003 movie page</a>, I kept all the film information in a text file. For a while I wanted to upgrade this to storing the info in a database and a more flexible object-oriented codebase. So since Sunday I've been working it out and now the project is at a state where the 2004 page shows the same as the old version. Still have a few more features to add for new display possibilities but it's cool for now.</p>
