<p>I just finished listening to the <a href="http://www.clearchannelmusic.com/cc-common/mfeatures/player/player.html?songLink=froggie&amp;folderName=brucespringsteenSP&amp;gateway=exiting">sneak peak</a> (note: the sneak peak is only available until tomorrow, April 20) of Bruce Springsteen's upcoming <span style="font-style:italic;">We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions</span> and am glad to report that I like it a whole lot better than after seeing the John Henry video <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2006_04_02_blog_archive.phtml#114416375322383751">a couple of weeks ago</a>. Even the closing bonus track, <span style="font-style:italic;">Froggie Went A-Courtin'</span>, which you probably remember best as a little kids' tune, came off well.</p>
<p>The most significant reason I can put my finger on is that the band's overall energy blasts out of the speakers from most of the songs. This isn't another <a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/albums/nebraska.html">Nebraska</a>, <a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/albums/devils.html">Devils and Dust</a> or <a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/albums/tomjoad.html">Ghost of Tom Joad</a>, with stark, minimal musical arrangements underlying darkly negative lyrics; of the three only <span style="font-style:italic;">Nebraska</span> really worked for me, mainly due to <span style="font-style:italic;">Atlantic City</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">State Trooper</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Johnny 99</span>. <span style="font-style:italic;">Seeger</span> is much more of a feelgood outing though old Pete's lyrics on tunes like <span style="font-style:italic;">John Henry</span> can twist their tales back against the instrumental backing. Maybe it's Greg Liszt's banjo but I can picture this music driving people to the dance floor at an old time hoedown.</p>
