<p>Wow! What a cool movie! Beautiful to watch on the big screen but works really well on a good TV too. Winner of four Academy Awards including Best Foreign Film and Best Cinematography. Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Zi Yi, and Chang Chen are fabulous in <a href="http://www.crouchingtiger.com/flash4.htm">Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon</a>. The film blends fantasy, martial arts, romance, and true emotion in a way I've never really seen before. Highly recommended, one of the few films I think is worth buying on DVD!</p>
