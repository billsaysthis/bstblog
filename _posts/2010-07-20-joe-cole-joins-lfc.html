<p>This is one signing I like! And very glad to see that the rumor that swirled up when Hodgson was about to jon the club came true. I felt that Cole was poorly used at Chelsea (and for England too), particularly after Mourinho left. With StevieG announcing today he's staying I'm feeling good about our attack for the coming season.</p>
<p>Joe looks good in the new white kit too</p>
