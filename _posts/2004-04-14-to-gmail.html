<p>I have one of those semi-coveted invitations to try out the new Google mail service but have been sitting on it for the last week. Do I really have any use, much less need, for yet another account? I have my choice of pretty much unlimited addresses at the billsaysthis.com domain, four on Hotmail (two that capture my name, with no numbers, which I figure are worth hanging on to, one that was my chat handle and one just for my eBay activity) plus one for Yahoo! that I only use for Yahoo! activity. People have written both positive and negative about the service and a free gigabyte of storage sounds nice... but really, it's just one more time sink and I can't figure out the purpose. Cool as it might be, Google seems to be a little late to the game for this heavy email user.</p>
<p><em>Later:</em> What the heck, I decided that I might as well take the freebie, so you can write me at b&lt;mylastname&gt;&lt;at&gt;gmail.com.</p>
