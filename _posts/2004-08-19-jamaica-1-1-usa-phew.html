<p>What a tough game we had today opening the group round of World Cup qualification against the Reggae Boyz at The Office (Jamaica's nickname for its national stadium), and this with the home side missing two key players due to injury. But chalk another one up for the (<a href="#fornow">for now</a> at least) Earthquake stars as Brian Ching scored the tying goal in the 89th minute off a slick little pass from Landon Donovan. I have to say, until that last gasp effort I was expecting a loss!</p>
<p>We had a very weak effort in midfield all game, sloppy passing that was no trouble at all for Jamaica to break up. This is no Grenada, let me tell you, with most of their starters playing in MLS or England--Damiani Ralph is third leading MLS goal scorer--and they are big and strong. USA is more fast and pacey, with very young, thinner players like Donovan and DaMarcus Beasley. Fortunately our backline was pretty tough and kept Kasey Keller from doing much work; their one score came in the 51st off a corner kick when one of the US players was out of position (not covering the far post) and left an opening too wide for Keller alone to handle.</p>
<p>The American team next faces El Salvador on Saturday, Sep. 4, at home and what I'd really love to see--do you hear me Bruce Arena?--is Donovan starting in midfield and Ching starting up top. Leave Chris Armas on the bench and position #21 just behind the two strikers, free to roam, in a 4-3-1-2 formation. We have more than enough defense for this and will get much more offense.</p>

<br />Why did I say "for now" about the Earthquakes? Rumors about Mexican power Club America buying the team and moving it to Houston or San Antonio are hotting up and say the announcement could come as early as tomorrow or Friday. Great timing as <a href="http://www.soccersiliconvalley.com/">Soccer Silicon Valley</a> is putting on a <a title="PDF file" href="http://www.soccersiliconvalley.com/pdf/ssv_rally_flyer.pdf">Save the Quakes rally</a> Friday (noon, downtown San Jose, free hotdogs and lemonade, lots of Quakes past and present, be there!) and Saturday is a special old timers' match celebrating the 30th anniversary of the original NASL Earthquakes. With all the rich men here in the Valley, isn't there one who wants to step up and buy the team which won two of the last three MLS crowns?<br /></p>
