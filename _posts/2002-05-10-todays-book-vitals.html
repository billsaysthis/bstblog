<p><a href="http://www.gregbear.com/">Greg Bear</a> has been one of the top science fiction authors of the last two decades, especially since the release of Eon in 1985, and this is shown in part by the fact that he is one of only two authors to win a Nebula Award in every category. Recently his novels have focused on what he terms <a href="http://www.gregbear.com/A55885/Bear.nsf/Pages/300067">The New Biology</a>; I missed Darwin's Radio but clearly I need to get a copy in hand.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.overbooked.org/vitals.html" title="For another perspective, click here">Vitals</a> does indeed focus on biology, specifically the intersection of evolution and the incorporation of parasitic intestinal bacteria and the possibility of immortality. Bear gives us antagonistic twins, Hal and Rob Cousins, both top of their game biologists who, we read, might have succeeded in their quest if only they could have put aside their lifelong sparring and shared. Instead they fall into the target sites of a separated Russian husband and wife who have pursued, with seemingly much success, the same avenues for 70 years and who are not interested in johnny-come-lately competition. Instead they send deadly agents who use engineered bacteria as often as conventional weapons.</p>
<p>Bear has not written a Hollywood-style thriller so don't expect a happy ending. He has written an engaging thriller, with pacing velocity increasing as we move through the second half, and forced me to stay awake into the early morning hours to get to the end. The setting is the present day, the backdrop is believable, the characters real, the ending...unnerving. One of my favorite lines is the next to last sentence:</p>
<p>"History is my brother's fist smashing into my face forever."</p>
<p><em>Highly recommended</em></p>
