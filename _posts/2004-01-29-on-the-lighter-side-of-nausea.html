<p>Very interesting: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnsoftware/html/software01262004.asp">Getting Started with Your Own Software Company</a> (and the inevitable <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/01/29/1739206">/. discussion</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://news.com.com/2010-7337-5149606.html?tag=nefd_acpro">Tech's medical marvels</a>: "For the past two years, more venture funding ($3.2 billion) has gone to medical device companies than to semiconductor makers ($2.8 billion), according to research firm VentureOne."</p>
<p>Word of the day: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics">Hermeneutics</a>. Because I just love the way it sounds and it turns out to be an interesting topic.</p>
<p>System overload: Doc says what I'm thinking in <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2004/01/29#orwhat">Orwhat?</a></p>
<p>There are dinosaurs among us? The Sci Fi Channel <a href="http://trekweb.com/articles/2004/01/29/40191ad0a593b.shtml">has given production go ahead</a> to a two hour movie version of Eric Garcia's <a href="http://www.sfsite.com/07a/ar84.htm">Anonymous Rex</a> and intends this as a pilot for a series.</p>
<p>A group of <em>Star Trek</em> and <em>Voyager</em> actors teamed up for <em>Roddenberry on Patrol</em>, a parody of the Great Bird himself. Bad web site, though.</p>
<p>This is not a metaphor: <a href="http://pub.tv2.no/nettavisen/english/article177749.ece">Swedes have more and more animal sex</a></p>
