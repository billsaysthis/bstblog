<p>AC Milan were comprehensive tonight in defeating Manchester United 3-0 to set up a rerun of the 2005 Champions League final against my beloved Liverpool. The Rossoneri were never really threatened and Dida was in his form of old the few times his goal was threatened, with the peerless Kaka leading an attack the injury-depleted Red Devil back line couldn't contain.</p>
<p>Kaka, a resurgent Clarence Seedorf and late substitute Alberto Gilardino had the goals. Seedorf and Gennaro Gattuso had control of the midfield and neither Michael Carrick nor Darren Fletcher were able to start any offense for the visitors, who had to start three second choice defenders while the lone regular starter, Nemanja Vidic, was not really recovered from a broken collarbone. Sir Alex Ferguson's eight year cycle of European glory came to an end (Cup Winners Cups in 1983 and 1991 and 1999's Champions League portion of that year's historic treble).</p>
<p>Milan have six European crowns to Liverpool's five and will surely be looking to remove <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2005_05_01_blog_archive.phtml#111705895261738395">the stink of their collapse</a> two years ago, giving up a 3-0 half time lead in the first 15 minutes of the second half and then losing on penalty kicks; their coach Carlo Ancelloti will try once again to become the first man to win European titles with four different teams. And in an odd bit of geographic rivalry, this year's title will be decided in Athens.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Go Reds!</span></p>
