<p>The Google Mac Blog had a post today <a href="http://googlemac.blogspot.com/2008/06/google-io.html">linking to the videos</a> from the recent Google I/O event. Being too expensive for me to attend, this seemed like a good thing. However, clicking the link in the post that should have taken me to the videos instead sent me to the Google Sites login page (which makes sense, they probably use Sites for these kind of pages).</p>
<p>Google official blogs do not have comments so I can't post this request to fix the the problem directly but the blogs do have a posts that link here feature. So let's see...</p>
