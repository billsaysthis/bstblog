<p>Michael Baldwin is running an interesting experiment at the <a href="http://www.commoncensus.org/index.php">CommonCensus Map Project</a>, asking visitors to answer four (multiple choice) questions about their geographic identification. Note to Michael Arrington and Robert Scoble: this is not a web 2.0 mashup, LOL, though it does use a small bit of JavaScript to magnify viewports on the map. I think it needs more people to complete the survey for the answers to get meaningful.</p>
