<p>As most <a href="http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=126273">reviewers</a> have written, this is a good movie. I'll agree to that and add that one reason for me is that new to the series director Alfonso Cuaron and written every one scripter Steve Kloves have found a way to make this a movie, keyed to pacing and plot, and not just a transliteration of the novel to the screen. As good as the novel is, a film is simply not the same thing; Peter Jackson faced off against a similar challenge in <em>LotR</em> and won.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.azkaban.com/">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a> is the film of the third book in the coming of age story of a young English Wizard, in case you've been serving in Afghanistan the last five years. This time out Harry doesn't have to face off against his main adversary, Lord He Who Must Not Be Named, but finds danger elsewhere. I do like most of the the visualizations of strange creatures from the book, the Dementers from Azkaban, the werewolf, the Hippograf.</p>
