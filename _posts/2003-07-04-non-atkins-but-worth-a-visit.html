<p>Next time you're in Manhattan, or at least the next time I'm there, diet or no, I'm going to visit Larry Forgione's Signature Cafe at Lord &amp; Taylor's department store on Fifth Avenue to try <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/04/dining/04JOUR.html">a new kind of ice cream sandwich</a>! First on the list: <em>"Dense, nutty chocolate bread provides the wrapper for two sandwiches, one filled with chocolate ice cream, the other with peanut butter..."</em></p>
