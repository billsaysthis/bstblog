<p>Judas... hung himself with his own rope<br />
<br />The heat caused him to lose control<br />
<br />Everything he wanted was just out of reach<br />
<br />Just think of him, that poor poor soul.</p>
<p>I know that you can spend days out in the sun<br />
<br />Work a picket, work a shovel, work a 'hammer<br />
<br />Walk the line up and down, wipe the sweat away<br />
<br />Whatever you do remember to drink your water</p>
<p>There's a shock of green over the horizon<br />
<br />Further away than you can get tonight<br />
<br />Try and sleep, try and rest before you go<br />
<br />That mirage will still be there at morning light</p>
<p>The heat makes you tired, so tired of moving<br />
<br />So hard to keep going, lifting your legs<br />
<br />Too tired to lift your head at the cry of a bird<br />
<br />So hot that you stumble wiping sweat from your brow</p>
<p>Weeks ago you sat by an ocean and the breeze<br />
<br />Kept you cool under a thatched roof, seated<br />
<br />On a bright white lounge drinking iced cold<br />
<br />Rum and fruit juice, no worries even over the horizon</p>
<p>Circumstances change, the world spins you over<br />
<br />That horizon comes closer, then is suddenly seen<br />
<br />In your rearview mirror, those deep blue and green<br />
<br />Waters and the tourists laying in the sand</p>
<p>Off in the distance now a buzzing sound, louder then<br />
<br />Softer, whirs and whorls shorter and longer but no rhythm<br />
<br />Machine sounds but no machine to be seen<br />
<br />Heat tempers the volume in waves of sand</p>
<p>There is no tablecloth on which to eat your meal<br />
<br />To keep your food and forks and dishes clean<br />
<br />Only the heat to make you sweat, no napkins to wipe<br />
<br />The beads away, to make you forget everything ever seen.</p>
