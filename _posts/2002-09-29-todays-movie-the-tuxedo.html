<p>The new Jackie Chan flick, <a href="http://www.dreamworks.com/thetuxedo/center.htm">The Tuxedo</a>, opened yesterday and frankly I expected it to steamroll Reese Witherspoon's <a href="http://www.sweet-home-alabama.com/">Sweet Home Alabama</a>. Neither got great reviews but the Chan appeal, with Jennifer Love Hewitt providing the hottie factor, should have done the job. Surprise, surprise because according to Box Office Mojo, the Southern fried romance <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/daily/">walloped this one</a> on opening night, 12.8 to 4.5 (millions).</p>
<p>We went with Chan, though, and our theater at a lunch time showing was mostly full and a friend reported being left in the cold by a sell out in Daly City. And though the reviewers had nothing good to say about The Tuxedo, we enjoyed ourselves and had many laughs. Chan is 48 years old now, still able to outfight the baddies but willing to take it easy if it won't hurt the film. Regardless of what was written, Chan made reasonable choices in this film.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, this is not the film of the year of even the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_09_08_blog_archive.phtml#85436874" title="Sum of All Fears was">best film</a> I saw this month. It is, however, funny and creative. There's one scene in particular I'm thinking of here, where Hewitt is in her office on the phone with Chan and one of her coworkers keeps holding up "I love you" notes to her, which she crumples and tosses. Screenwriter <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Leeson,%20Michael">Michael Leeson</a> has a very impressive oevre going back to <em>Love, American Style</em> and <em>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</em>, so that's not too surprising.</p>
<p><em>Recommended for the fun</em></p>
