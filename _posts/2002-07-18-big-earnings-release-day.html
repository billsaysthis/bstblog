<p>After the market closes today, <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/research/earncal/20020718.html">quarterly numbers come out</a> for SUNW ($0.01/share profit consensus estimate) and MSFT ($0.42). Other software and internet companies due to report include: APLX  ($0.04), ASKJ (<span style="color:red;">-$0.21</span>), EBAY, INFA ($0.00), IT ($0.12), KANA (<span style="color:red;">-$0.28</span>), MERQ ($0.14), PSFT ($0.13), SIVB ($0.32), FON ($0.33), PCS (<span style="color:red;">-$0.07</span>), TMTA (<span style="color:red;">-$0.18</span>), and WEBX ($0.04). Could be a big day in any near term turnaround if a large number of these companies meet or exceed expectations.</p>
