<p>Usually, top aide Rove is close enough to ride herd on Pseudo-president Bush. Apparently that wasn't the case this morning and Our Leader let his lips loose:</p>
<p><em>"There are some who feel like that conditions are such that they can attack us there," Bush <a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=2NNHIK0CM3Z0WCRBAEZSFEY?type=politicsNews&amp;storyID=3027226">told reporters</a> at the White House. "My answer is bring them on. We have the force necessary to deal with the situation."</em></p>
<p>The fact that American soldiers are dying and being seriously injured on a daily basis ought to be telling these clowns in D.C. something but they just don't seem to be listening. After all, just yesterday <a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=ZDTZ4I5E4MSBUCRBAEZSFEY?type=politicsNews&amp;storyID=3022846">he admitted</a> that resolving the situation in Iraq will take a "massive" American presence for years to come. <em>Wonderful, no?</em></p>
