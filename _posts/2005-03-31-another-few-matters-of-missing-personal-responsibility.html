<p>Two very different cases, hugely different scales, but very same outcome for the perpetrators: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/30/business/30cnd-insure.html?ex=1269838800&amp;en=9e9ba26536ef79af&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">A.I.G. Discloses Its Accounting Was Improper in Some Deals</a> and <a href="http://ww.pennnet.com/news/display_news_story.cfm?Section=WIREN&amp;Category=HOME&amp;NewsID=116887">Salt pond effort suffers setback</a>. In the AIG case some top executives have lose their jobs, more may yet, and shareholders are still out at least $1.7 billion; here in the South Bay government officials (or contractors, not clear on this point) allowed "millions of gallons of contaminated water into the bay last summer in violation of their environmental permits" but the regulators involved are not planning to impose even the trivial fine the law offers.</p>
<p>Do I hear jail time? No. Do I hear big fines? No. Even a public apology? Ha ha ha ha!!!</p>
