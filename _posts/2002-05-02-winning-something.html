<p>If you check the <a href="http://www.calottery.com/games/superlottoplus/drawresults.asp">California Lottery - SuperLotto Plus Draw Results</a> (before 8:00 p.m. PST Saturday 4 May 2002), you will see that the winning numbers for last night's draw were the oddly clustered set 39 40 45 46 47 Mega 11 and that one person won the top prize of $35 million. Unfortunately, that person was not me. I do have, however, one of 69,047 tickets with three matching numbers (but not the Mega) and have therefore won the estimable sum of $10. Homer says Woohoo! I will not reveal how much I have spent over the past few months to win this princely amount but let's just say you ought to be on the floor laughing about this point.</p>
