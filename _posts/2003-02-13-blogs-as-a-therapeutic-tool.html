<p>In which I am quoted to good effect: <a href="http://counseling.org/ctonline/Groundhog0203.htm">Not Groundhog Day, but seeing shadow sides online</a>. A very interesting article which was written by Dawn Pennington, a fellow <a href="http://caterwauling.com/blog/">blogger</a>, for Counseling Today, an official publication of the American Counseling Association--Dawn's also the magazine's Managing Editor after a recent promotion.</p>
