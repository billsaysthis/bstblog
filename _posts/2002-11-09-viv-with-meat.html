<td valign="top">Another meat run to Costco, The Sweet One holding (most of) the proceeds. That box is filled with salmon (raw and smoked), cod, chicken breasts and thighs, ground beef, steak, and pork chops. Not shown are two whole chickens, cause they just didn't fit into the box'o'meat. Notice how thin she is after two months on Atkins? What a hottie!</p>
<p>Tonight we'll be feasting on steak and asparagus, tomorrow she'll be roasting a chicken in a homemade, low carb version of teriyaki sauce accompanied by whatever fresh greens we find at the Mountain View Farmers Market.</p>
<p>Homemade teriyaki sauce, you ask? Well, soy sauce is clearly the base and has no carbs. I'll need to taste test along the way but I'm thinking <a href="http://www.splenda.com">Splenda</a> as the sweetening agent, some sesame oil, and a little bit of extra virgin olive oil. Will let you know how it comes out.</td>
