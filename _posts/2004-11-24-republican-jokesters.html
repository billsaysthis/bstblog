<p>William Safire, who can't retire soon enough to suit me, had another of his absurdities on the Time's OpEd page today and I was inspired to fire this off:</p>
<p>I read today's essay by William Safire (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/24/opinion/24safire.html?ex=1259038800&amp;en=1201e42257594ccd&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">Steamroller out of steam</a>) with an increasingly sad laughter ringing in my head. He derides the 9/11 victims' families and associated efforts to finally bring some order and coherence to our intelligence efforts as racing ahead of need, even though the matter has been discussed widely and hearings held during which critics of the reform testified, while on the facing page we see a true Congressional steamroller in operation (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/24/opinion/24wed2.html?ex=1259038800&amp;en=10cbbe98b4dfbaad&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">Snookering the taxpayers</a>) and just yesterday another exposing the same shameful action (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/23/opinion/23tue2.html?n=Top%2fOpinion%2fEditorials%20and%20Op%2dEd%2fEditorials">Rolling Back Women's Rights</a>). Where is Mr. Safire's outrage at these shenanigans, where important changes were made without a single committee hearing, a single day for Congresspeople to read and understand just what their vote was about?</p>
