<p>BBC brings us the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/asia-pacific/newsid_1808000/1808976.stm">latest amusement from North Korea</a>, which is oh so sad after being named a member of the Axis of Evil by GWB. But aren't the good communists in that fair land atheists and if so, why would they believe in religious being like a devil?</p>
