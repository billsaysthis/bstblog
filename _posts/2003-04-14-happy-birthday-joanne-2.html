<p>Some people are very fortunate and have close, loving relationships with their families. I've been around people who don't and that simply makes me sad, even if the people involved accept it and don't let it get them down. I'm really happy that I do have such wonderful people in my family, such a terrific benefit in many different ways. And today my sister Joanne celebrates her birthday and I want to tell her: I love you and I'm grateful to have your love and friendship.</p>
