<p>Jello. Do you like Jello? My mom and dad, who shared a lot of the cooking chores, made it once in awhile when I was a kid though I preferred pudding. Pre-Cosby though. Pre-Atkins too because pudding is way too many carbs to consider eating now. Jello is a great Atkins dessert, with whipped cream. Recently Del Monte came out with low carb canned fruit, which doesn't involved any more artificial ingredients than any other canned fruit and tastes fine to me, and so now we add that in. I'm staring at the empty little glass dish that my Jello and whipped cream was in, sitting on top of an equally empty water glass. They're on a coaster so no problem.</p>
