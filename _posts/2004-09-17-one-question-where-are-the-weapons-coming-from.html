<p>[I've sent this email to several bloggers who are connected into our journalistic infrastructure with the hope that they'll pass it on to an investigative reporter willing to find an answer. More or less in the spirit of <a href="http://onesimplequestion.blogspot.com/2004/08/just-one-question.html">One Question</a>, though without the PayPal-driven bounty.]</p>
<p>What happened yesterday in Afghanistan (the assassination attempt on Karzai) started me thinking, in broader and broader scope about the above-captioned question. Sure, in small amounts guns and explosives are not difficult to come by but on the scale of the larger terrorist groups, where do all the machine guns and mortars come from?</p>
<p>There must be factories, in other words, manufacturing them. In the Cold War days we had the so-called arms merchants like Adnan Kashoggi who arranged these deals; who are the Kashoggis of today? I'm pretty sure that our government can find these most likely large and immobile facilities if they try. However, I have yet to read in any (news) publication about any attempts to find them.</p>
<p>When you add in the weapons demands of the drug cartels and other out and out criminal organizations, we're talking about some fairly large quantities of arms.</p>
