<p>Since I'm all about the self-congratulations, and even though it didn't take open heart surgery to make me do it, I want to congratulate myself on passing the two year mark of not smoking yesterday. &lt;elvis accent&gt;Thank you, thank you very much.&lt;/elvis accent&gt; And props to my boys Lord B (2.25 years last week) and Grandmaster E (1.28 years) for the same stellar accomplishment.</p>
