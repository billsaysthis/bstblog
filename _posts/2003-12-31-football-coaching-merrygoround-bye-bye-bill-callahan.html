<p>After waiting an extra day to allow his son, a freshman QB at UCLA, to focus on the Silicon Valley Bowl, the Raiders announced that Bill Callahan <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=1697545">was not offered a new contract</a> and will not return for a third season as head coach. ESPN says that he'll likely head down to Florida and join Gruden's staff in Tampa Bay. A bad day all around for the Callahans as Brian's team could not muster any punch and lost the bowl game to Fresno State. Looking to the future, ESPN's Len Pasquarelli posted an interesting column yesterday <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&amp;id=1697489">breaking down the seven current openings</a> and he forecasts Dallas offensive coordinator Maurice Carthon or former University of Washington coach Rick Neuheisel as the new front for Al Davis; he dismisses Dennis Green as a man who would love the job but won't be able to close a deal with Davis.</p>
