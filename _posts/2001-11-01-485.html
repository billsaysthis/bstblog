<p><b>Microsoft: a useful new remedy</b></p>
<p>Curt Wuollet, writing on OPOpinion, asks the important question: <a href="http://www.osopinion.com/perl/story/14505.html">Government Contracts - Why Does Microsoft Still Have Them?</a>. After the feds and many states have been pursuing Gates &amp; Co. for so many years, you have to wonder why the federal government is Microsoft's biggest customer. As Curt points out, this is a no-brainer, low hanging fruit, and would open up some big opportunities for Microsoft competitors--not to mention providing a powerful incentive to Microsoft to clean up their act.</p>
<p>For all his ranting, how come <a href="http://web.siliconvalley.com/content/sv/opinion/dgillmor/weblog/">Dan Gillmor</a> hasn't brought this one up by now? Or the high paid lawyers at <a href="http://www.procompetition.org/procomp/">ProComp</a> and the other anti-MS groups?</p>
