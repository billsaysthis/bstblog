<p>After reading comments on MetaFilter, Slashdot and elsewhere over the years, I finally took the chance to watch Japanese animation classic <a href="http://www.manga.com/ghost/ghost.html">Ghost in the Shell</a>. Based on a bestselling manga (a distinctly Japanese, adult form of comic book) of the same name, the movie is a brief science fiction story about a squad of government agents matched up against another agency of the same, unnamed government to retrieve an artifical intelligence called both Project 2501 and the Puppet Master.</p>
<p>Story and graphic design remind me of such films as <span style="font-style:italic;">Blade Runner</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Matrix</span>. The Big Guy suggested to me that perhaps I was less impressed by <span style="font-style:italic;">GitS</span> watching it in very late 2004 than I would have been during its initial 1995 run. Perhaps. The dialog was a bit stilted and pedantic, though possibly due to the English translated voiceover rather than the Japanese original. Ah well, not a bad way to spend 90 minutes, and maybe the 2002 TV series and 2004 full-length sequel will be worth seeking out as well.</p>
