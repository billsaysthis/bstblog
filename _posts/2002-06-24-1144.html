<p><strong>First mover disadvantage</strong> - <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/filters/printerfriendly/0,6061,2871797-92,00.html">Do you really need an app server?</a>: "The real long-term losers become BEA and Sun. The company that launched the Java revolution (Sun) will ultimately be swept away by the companies who perfect the application server environment that makes truly scalable enterprise applications possible (IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle)." [<em>via <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/mt/archives/000083.shtml#000083">Karl</a></em>]</p>
