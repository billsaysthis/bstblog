<p><a href="http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=4157282">Beckhams' Girlie Name Choice Is Plain Stupid</a>, according to allegedly intelligent people quoted in a British newspaper. The world's most famous couple, David and Victoria Beckham, named their newborn son Cruz--cross in Spanish--and somehow people who've never met them feel comfortable and qualified to judge their choice. Wow, must suck to be Lola Oria, a university tutor who gave the article it's title with her qords, and authors Rachel Williams and Louise Barnett; their lives must be really miserable to get kicks from this.</p>
