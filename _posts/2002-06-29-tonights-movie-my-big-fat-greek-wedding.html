<p>Looking for a funny, sweet romantic comedy that doesn't descend into treacle or formula? Then go see Nia Vardalos' <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0259446">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</a> and watch Vardalos and John Corbett (Sex and the City, The Visitor, Nothern Exposure) fall in love amidst the foils of family expectations. There are laughs big and small in the script written by Ms. Vardalos and the direction by Joel Zwick avoids the expected. Michael Constantine, who I haven't seen in quite awhile, plays the Greek father who only wants to continue his family's heritage and Lainie Kazan his wife who understands a daughter should find her own way, regardless of what the father says.</p>
