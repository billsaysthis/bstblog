<p>Its a long way from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065989/">Little Fauss and Big Halsy</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068828/">Lady Sings the Blues</a> to this 1999 film, but the connection is Sidney Furie directed all three. Really makes one wonder. Especially since this film barely seems to actually have been directed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0174557/">The Collectors</a> is the story of a few days in New York City for AK and Ray, two big debt collectors for a New Orleans mobster who've tired of the gig. To say that the film makes little sense is giving Furie and writers Robert Anton and David Penotti more credit than they deserve. The only reason I watched to the end is because I was eating lunch and my hands were too dirty to pick up the remote.</p>
<p>The only remotely interesting thing about <span style="font-style:italic;">The Collectors</span> is Rick Fox, ex-LA Lakers forward, who has been working over the last few years to transition into acting. You can see he has good moves but the facility with dialog and emotion is yet to come. He is pretty tall though and makes co-star Casper van Diem seem short.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">not recommended</span> in the least<br /></p>
