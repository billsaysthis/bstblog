<p>Soccernet is <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/et/corr/correspondents?league=fifa.world&amp;cc=5901">looking for a few good bloggers</a> to follow their favorite team at World Cup 2006 this June. While the selected are not being sent to cover the Finals in person I still would love to be chosen as the USA correspondent. The application form asked for a writing sample, a fantasy scoop on my preferred team.</p>
<p>What could I write about? The biggest fantasy IMHO will be a win in the game we'll play if we finish second in the group round and the defending champion Brasileiros play to form and win their own group. Here's what I submitted and, remember, this is supposed to be a fantasy:</p>
<p>USA 2-1 Brazil! I just cannot believe it, an unimaginable historic victory for Team USA, and neither can my neighbors as the screaming will not stop after we knocked out the holders in the round of 16. Samba-schmamba, Uncle Sam's army is doing the dancing tonight as Rio and Sao Paulo do the funeral waltz instead.</p>
<p>How did Claudio Reyna master Ronaldinho and the back four silence Ronaldo and Robino? I will be watching this over and over on TiVo, no matter what happens tomorrow, and just show me where to pre-order the DVD.</p>
<p>Baby! Roberto Carlos could not keep up with Damarcus and Landon made his opportunities to feed the offense but all props to McBride for the first half lead and Brian Ching making the winner minutes after coming on for the last 20. Ching! There will be babies named after his aerial exploit tonight.</p>
<p>Oh my! Oh My!</p>
