<p>In present-day Russia, the politicians and oligarchs <a href="http://www.reuters.co.uk/newsPackageArticle.jhtml?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=393775&amp;section=news">don't seem to play nice together</a>. The government would prefer, according to the Reuters article, to deal with foreign control than fellow Russians who pose a political threat. I've been paying a little bit more to this situation because one of the young Russian tycoons, Roman Abramovich, bought <a href="http://www.chelseafc.com/index.asp" title="Chelsea FC">a team in the Premiership</a> last Spring--he's since spent well over US$150 million on new players for it--after seeing the writing on the Moscow wall and selling off his nearly $2 billion controlling stake in a big aluminum company. President Putin, if I might make a perhaps overly simplistic observation, seems to be having difficulty shaking off his KGB upbringing and helping his nation complete the transition to Western capitalism.</p>
