<p>Now, the bilious tone of the previous entry not withstanding, I've generally been fortunate enough to have quite good, and humane, managers. For the most part, that rant didn't come from personal experience but just the absurdity of the whole celebrate your boss idea. I realize that greeting card and small gift companies just love coming up with new holidays with which to extract more and more money from our wallets but this one is simply pathetic.</p>
