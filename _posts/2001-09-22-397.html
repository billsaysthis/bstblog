<p><b>Little things</b></p>
<p>Sometimes little things get to me. I'm watching the Notre Dame-Michigan State football game, of course rooting against Notre Dame, and NBC showed the ND and MSU marching bands performing <a href="http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/a/m/amazgrac.htm">Amazing Grace</a> together. Of course they kept shifting to people in the stands, holding flags, whispering in their little children's ears, just being Americans. And I cried again.</p>
