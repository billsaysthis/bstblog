<p>Congress is now calling for public comments on the Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act (CBDTPA). You can <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/special/input_form.cfm?comments=1">post yours here</a>. Also, follow the links over on the right and see why, if you don't already know. The following is what I wrote:</p>
<p>Have we reached a time when there is no difference between the surreal and the real? Does Congress exist to serve the People, as our lovely yet increasingly honored in name only Constitution says, or to serve the Corporate Interests?</p>
<p>This bill is pitiful and I say this as a creator of original works. My own website has material for which I claim copyright, including poetry, fiction, and commentary. But I fail to see how Senator Hollings' legislation protects any of my rights. The way it protects the interests of Disney, Fox, and Vivendi are quite clear though, and I would point out that two of those three entities are not even American corporations.</p>
<p>Please remember that phrases like limited term and fair use are important and meaningful to many Americans, more important than enslaving our technology to the interests of business giants.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
