<p>I really have never understood the arguments against same gender marriages so <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7403547.stm">today's ruling</a> from the California State Supreme Court seems both logical and right.</p>
<p>All arguments against this change come down to religious, emotional or straw man fallacies:
<ol>
<li><span style="font-style:italic;">The Bible says its wrong.</span> Not being Christian or particularly religious in any mainstream sense I'm probably not qualified to say if it does or doesn't, though the evidence of which I'm aware seems weak. Either way, the First Amendment precludes this argument from having any legal standing.</li>
<li><span style="font-style:italic;">Gays, lesbians and bisexuals are sick and need help, not support.</span> You are entitled to your opinions but until you can produce substantive evidence, that's all this is.</li>
<li><span style="font-style:italic;">Tradition says marriage is one man and one woman.</span> Yeah well, until 140 years ago tradition said one could own slaves in this country, until 90 years ago only men were qualified to vote and until 40 years ago interracial marriage was illegal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Did I miss any of the major arguments supporting this outdated position?</p>
<p>The Court acted to overturn a ballot initiative passed in 2000 making the one man/one woman standard state law.</p>
<p>By the way, six of the seven Justices are Republicans and Gov. Schwarzenegger has already said he would not support reversing this ruling by amendment</p>
<p>Even so, I have very little doubt that before close of business today there will be <del>nutjobs</del> <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/05/15/BAGAVNC5K.DTL">groups filing papers</a> with the State for an amendment to the Constitution overturning the ruling.</p>
<p>One can only hope that a majority of voters in this state will recognize that their calendars say 2008, not 1508.</p>
