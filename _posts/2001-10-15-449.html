<p><b>Capitalism at the edge</b></p>
<p>Have you gotten spam lately advertising gas masks or Cipro? garret <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/posts/01/20011015">reports</a> getting spam touting Viagra as "the most powerful anti-anthrax agent available." I dislike receiving spam certainly but I also don't mind too much getting it, since we live in a capitalist society and these people are simply taking advantage of the system as it exists now. I would like to see some improvements in the system, like a real opt-out/remove function. Still, spam is a small price to pay for so much functionality for which I pay so little.</p>
