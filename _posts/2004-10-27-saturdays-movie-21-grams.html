<p>Not every movie is made so that people can sit in their seats and get 90 minutes of mindless enjoyment. Not that <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_03_28_blog_archive.phtml#108070778482062988">mindless</a> <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_07_20_blog_archive.phtml#105874857096226649">enjoyment</a> is a bad thing, just not what some people want every time. <a href="http://www.21-grams.com/index.php" title="Title does not refer to drugs">21 Grams</a> is not mindless entertainment, not even close.</p>
<p>The three leads--Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro--do outstanding work as do several of the supporting cast (Melissa Leo, Eddie Marsan). The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto does some great things with light and contrast. The underlying concept, connecting three people who have no obvious connections, is smart.</p>
<p>But what really takes this movie out of the ordinary and out of the mainstream is the almost random sequencing. I was completely confused until about half way in because director <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0327944/">Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu</a> was determined to strain the limits of comprehension. This will turn many people off but in the end leaving early will be their loss. To me the sequence is logical if you consider the emotional development instead of just plot.</p>
