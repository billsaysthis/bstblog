<p><b>Attitudes towards NYC are changing</b></p>
<p>For many years many people from the American heartland looked at New York City as, literally, a den of iniquity and almost life on another planet. Growing up in its shadow, I never felt that way or particularly understood the attitude except that I felt those who held it were ignorant hicks (which is probably just as bad). But in the aftermath of 9/11, seeing not only the tragedy but the response to it as well, the 'hicks' are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/15/national/15INDI.html">reconsidering their opinion</a>. So maybe we'll be more of a 'one people' than before, I can only hope.</p>
