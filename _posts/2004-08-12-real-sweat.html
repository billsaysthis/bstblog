<p>Have you ever felt a true cold sweat<br />
<br />Dripping down the small of your back, the<br />
<br />Side of your face while you stand shaking<br />
<br />With a gun pointed at your chest?</p>
<p>I focused on the shirt he wore, color and texture<br />
<br />Glaring in my eyes, a wrinkled, bleached<br />
<br />Old blue t-shirt, some woman's face and<br />
<br />Ugly slogan splashed across the front</p>
<p>Every time I closed my eyes my assailant<br />
<br />Shouted at me to open them, to look at him,<br />
<br />To see just who was going to end my miserable<br />
<br />Existence on this Earth.</p>
<p>That was what he said, miserable existence,<br />
<br />Which made me wonder why someone with<br />
<br />Such a vocabulary would be theatening<br />
<br />To send me to the Great Oblivion</p>
<p>The gunman wasn't dressed well, wasn't<br />
<br />Clean, wasn't shaved, wasn't even healthy<br />
<br />Looking, there was no surprise to see him<br />
<br />On the business end of the gun</p>
<p>My shaking legs reminded me that such<br />
<br />Concerns were not important, not how<br />
<br />I should be spending my last moments,<br />
<br />Not going to help me survive</p>
<p>You already have my money, my keys, my<br />
<br />Surrender so what else do you want, what else<br />
<br />Can I give you other than a few final<br />
<br />Breaths of this precious body?</p>
<p>The hand holding the black metal three feet from<br />
<br />Me came closer but the speed of its shaking increased,<br />
<br />I looked up into his eyes, he finally turned and raced away<br />
<br />I drew up in a great air and collapsed.<br /></p>
