<p>From 2001, <a href="http://www.mgm.com/title_title.do?title_star=YTUMAMAT">Y tu mama tambien</a> is a critically acclaimed movie made in Mexico by Alfonso Cuaron (who is directing <a href="http://harrypotter.warnerbros.com/web/dailyprophet/article.jsp?id=POA_Teaser_Trailer">the next Harry Potter film</a>) about two teenage boys and a slightly older woman who learn about life, love and themselves in the course of a trip to an isolated beach. Very tittilating movie mining wellworn territory.</p>
<p>Frankly I don't understand why this film was so well received (such as an Oscar nomination for Best Writing that Cuaron shared with his brother) but perhaps it was the pseudo-innocent sexuality swirled with mixed-high left wing politics. The film opens with one of the boys and his girlfriend, naked and tossing together in bed, followed by the other boy sneaking in some last-minute sex with his own chickie before the two girls fly off for a Summer holiday in Italy. And the Cuaron brothers throw in more physicality about any chance they get. Meanwhile, there is talk of political corruption, protests and economic disparity combined with classism around every bend.</p>
