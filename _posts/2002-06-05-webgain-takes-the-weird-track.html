<p>Formed over the past three years as a Java development tools powerhouse, WebGain <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/53/25579.html">news leaked today</a> that the company will sell it's TopLink OR mapping tool to Oracle, discontinue development of its market-leading IDE Visual Cafe/WebGain Studio (but make the source available to the Open Source community), and try to make a living off licensing and support revenues. The 120 person IDE R&amp;D staff can kiss their jobs goodbye although the TopLink developers will get jobs at Oracle. Apparently, only TopLink was bringing in revenue while most of the R&amp;D dollars were going to the IDE products. Given the good tools freely available from Sun (<a href="http://forte.sun.com/ffj/index.html">Sun ONE Studio</a>, formerly Forte for Java/NetBeans) and IBM (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>), combined with very tight corporate purchasing lately, this turn of events isn't very difficult to understand. One does wonder, though, if the revenue plan will ever deliver back the sunk investment.</p>
