<p><b>Have to See TV: Cartoon Network</b><br />

<p>Beginning this fall, most kid's favorite cable network will air <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010612/en/television-cartoon_1.html">"Adult Swim''</a>, a three hour bock of adult-oriented animated shows including the Space Ghost talk show, Sealab 2021, Home Movies (a 3rd grader captures his life on 'film'), and two that I think will be really funny:
<ul>
</ul>
<p>
<li>"Aqua Teen Hunger Force,'' a cartoon that follows an elite group of detectives who are also human-sized food products;<br />

<li>"Leave It to Brak,'' a parody of the classic family sitcom featuring demented space alien Brak.</li>
</li>
