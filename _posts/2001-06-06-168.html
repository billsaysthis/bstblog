<p><b>CEO: Who made out today</b><br />

<p>C|Net has this amusing little web page, the <a href="http://investor.cnet.com/investor/quotes/ceometer-topbottom5/0-9970-1052-0.html">CEO Wealth Meter</a>. It lists the CEO for each company with his or her value of holdings and the day's change. I've linked to the Top 5/Bottom 5 page, which lists who did the best and worst for the day. The <a href="http://investor.cnet.com/investor/quotes/ceometer-tech/0-9970-1051-0-0.html?tag=ctb5">More CEOs</a> link on the bottom of the page takes you to the complete list which unfortunately is displayable only in alphabetical order; I'd certainly like to see it in Value of Holdings order.</p>
<p>Note: I'm not sure if the link above always resolves to the current date values or to the value for the day I linked to it. Check and see for yourself!</p>
