<p>Ts1 and I returned to the casa last night, a little later than expected but otherwise well. We had a terrific honeymoon, photos of some of the activies and sites will be posted in the near future for the obsessive fanbase, and are still happy about the whole marriage thing. Lot of errands and catching up stuff to do but more blogging to follow.</p>
