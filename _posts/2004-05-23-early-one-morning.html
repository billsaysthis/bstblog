<p>Be careful what you ask for<br />
<br />When you're dreaming in the night time<br />
<br />Cause you don't know when you wake up<br />
<br />If your askings will be there</p>
<p>If the colors start to fracture<br />
<br />As you turn to look away<br />
<br />Consider that the colors tell<br />
<br />Each other just what to say</p>
<p>In the landscape in your left eye<br />
<br />Lush greens flower with a whisper<br />
<br />That can be heard above lower branches<br />
<br />On this side of the smaller river</p>
<p>Your right eye flashes black and white<br />
<br />Back and forth, and when light hits<br />
<br />Animals stand, then jump, then twist<br />
<br />Away to the horizon and darkness</p>
<p>BangBangBang--a cracking noise behind<br />
<br />Three times and when you turn firecracker<br />
<br />Paper is floating to the grass and<br />
<br />Clowns smile, or at least their paint does</p>
<p>Up the river comes a huge brown canoe<br />
<br />Pairs of men seated from front to back<br />
<br />Straining muscles to pull along rafts<br />
<br />Strung behind it, covered in gold bars</p>
<p>The paddlers chant in a wild mixture,<br />
<br />French, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi,<br />
<br />Softer and louder, softer and louder<br />
<br />Picking up the pace of the boat</p>
<p>BangBangBang--you whirl around again, don't you?<br />
<br />No firecracker paper, no gun, no smoke<br />
<br />The light flashes again but what you<br />
<br />See is only two empty suits standing</p>
<p>The canoe comes to shore fifty yards<br />
<br />From where you stand and the rafts crash<br />
<br />In behind them and the bricks spill<br />
<br />Onto the grass and the men scream</p>
<p>The suits race to grab at the bricks,<br />
<br />The paddlers wave their hands wildly in the air<br />
<br />You scream "Stop no Stop no Stop no"<br />
<br />The bricks explode into firecracker paper</p>
<p>Be careful what you ask for<br />
<br />When you're dreaming in the night time<br />
<br />Cause you don't know when you wake up<br />
<br />If your askings will be there</p>
