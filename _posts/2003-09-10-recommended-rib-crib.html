<p>There's a fairly new place over in Cupertino on Stevens Creek Boulevard. <a href="http://www.ribcrib.com">the Rib Crib</a>, and I highly recommend it to those of you with large appetites. Every Tuesday night is the All-You-Can-Eat Special for $10.99 and that includes as much of the side dishes as you can stuff down as well. We at least were good in that regard, sticking mainly to the growing the huge piles of starkly naked bones on our plates. And the cole slaw, that was very tasty too, though I have a sneaking suspicion that's because there's a goodly amount of sugar in it. We'll see at the morning weigh-in. Anyway, food's good but be careful on the parking.</p>
