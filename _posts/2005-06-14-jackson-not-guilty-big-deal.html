<p>Really, why do people other than the victims' families and community care? I know, America is all about the celebrity news these days and what's better than a star of Jackson's magnitude facing such nasty criminal charges? Pedophile, or not, that so few people were surprised much by the indictment is not a good sign for me. That he was acquitted is probably a good result since the prosecutor seemed (from the furthest remove I could manage) to put on a crap case.</p>
<p>This isn't a second OJ deal in the sense that Simpson's lawyers were like artists playing to a carefully selected jury, although then too the DAs didn't match up well. Jackson--IMO--probably did some shit that crossed over the line I'd draw between appropriate and bad  behavior but nothing that rose to the felony level. To some degree, the current high visibility of child molestation cases didn't help him nor did his odd public personality. He's no Catholic priest or Boy Scot troop leader, though, pulling little kids in to give or get sexual favors.</p>
<p>If I could get one positive change out of this, which I sadly acknowledge is not going to happen any time soon, the news media would stop setting up like camp followers outside every celebrity trial or travail to deliver hundreds and thousands of hours of nearly content-free coverage. Play repeats of <span style="font-style:italic;">Knots Landing</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">Bonanza</span>, I don't care, just stop shoving this crap down our throats. Please.</p>
