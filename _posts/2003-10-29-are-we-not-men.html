<p>Corporations are about making a profit, no doubt. But corporations are not, Supreme Court decisions aside people, but rather congregations of individuals. So then I wonder how these people so lose sight of reality as to push their <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/28/opinion/28BROO.html">corporate interests so ridiculously ahead</a> of the good of their own country. The linked article discusses a current controversy over Boeing's attempt to separate the federal government from an extra $6.5 BILLION by leasing some planes to the military rather than purchasing them up front. This is just symptomatic, though, of the 'Every dollar must belong to me' attitude so prevalent today.</p>
