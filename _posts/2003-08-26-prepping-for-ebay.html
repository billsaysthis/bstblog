<p>I'm using their TurboLister software to prepare a batch of items for listing all at once. <em>Go, but go big</em> is my motto here. The items are an assortment of things I've got laying around the house: a couple of no longer used cellphones, an old DSL modem, some promotional tech company t-shirts, an ELP CD box set, a couple of videotape box sets (I don't have a VCR any more...), and a combo pack of iPlanet promotional items. Not really sure how to price the last one but I'll probably start it at $19.99 plus shipping and see where it goes from there.</p>
<p>I've also had some further conversations with Rogulus. I'm going to pick up some inexpensive DVD and CD sets at Costco, then break them into individual items and profit on the arbitrage. He's had some very good results with the specific items and I hope to copy that success, with permission of course.</p>
<p>Plan is to go live tomorrow.</p>
