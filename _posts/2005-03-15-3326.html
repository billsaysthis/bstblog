<p>Yes, well, the potential work-related thing did turn into a real paying position at a new company founded by one of the NetDynamics founders. Very early days, very small, lots to do, lots of ways to contribute. First day, today, was very enjoyable in this sense. Tiring, long too. Not much more I can really put out at this time, will blab all over when that day comes. Of course have already proposed a blog for the company.</p>
