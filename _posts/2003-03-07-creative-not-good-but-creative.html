<p>I enjoy doing many different artsy, creative things. Have never achieved any, say, competence at any of them but nonetheless do enjoy the effort. So when the <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com">g-man</a> passed along <a href="http://www.the5line.com/">the 5 line self portrait</a>, how could I resist? I couldn't:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/5line2.gif" alt="My 5 line submission" height="200" /></p>
<p>I encourage you to give it a go yourself. Are my lips really that big?</p>
