<p>Nothing in human culture exists without a context. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/07/opinion/07behe.html?ex=1265518800&amp;en=b530716e1f96e7ba&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">Michael Behe explains</a> the four linked claims that argue for Intelligent Design and fails to provide the context. What, I wonder, is responsible for the intelligence of the designs we see around us?<span style="font-style:italic;"> "[T]he theory of intelligent design is not a religiously based idea,"</span> he writes but then finishes his essay without addressing this central question. Semantics aside, no one can doubt that in the world view of Behe and the Intelligent Design community, the designer is God. And then, so much for his proposition that ID is a scientific theory comparable to evolution.</p>
