<p>While the crowd of clowns pursue the GOP nomination, President Obama is unopposed on the Democratic side (as we would expect). Though I expect to vote for him or not at all I would love to get answers to a few questions on positions he's taken during his first term.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why has your Administration continued, and even increased, the use of top secret classifications, national security letters and similar dark side tools?</li>
<li>Related: Why is Bradley Manning being prosecuted?</li>
<li>Why are former partners and employees of Goldman Sachs so prominent in your Administration?</li>
<li>Why has your Administration not acted on the Too Big To Fail financial institutions? That is, pushed for legislation and/or regulatory changes that would make them no long Too Big. If anything, these corporations are now even larger and potentially bigger catastrophes waiting to happen!</li>
<li>Iran, North Korea and Pakistan still have nuclear weapons or the capability to build them. Why?</li>
<li>Why is your Administration opposed to medical marijuana and legalization of marijuana and other recreational drugs?</li>
<li>Why isn't your Administration moving to better protect the environment from fraking and similar resource extraction technology?
	</li>
<li>Why did your Administration participate in the secret ACTA treaty negotiations?</li>
<li>Why is your Administration extraditing Richard O'Dwyer for creating a website that simply links to shared files, even though the site itself did not offer any shared files?</li>
<li>Why is your Administration, via the DHS, monitoring the Internet for political dissent?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> "National security" in and of itself, with no further elaboration is not a sufficient answer to any of the above.</p>
