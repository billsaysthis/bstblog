<p>In the minutes before the final BCS rankings are announced, a <a href="http://polls.yahoo.com/public/archives/2716712/p-sp-1">Yahoo! Sports poll</a> shows USC is an overwhelming favorite (83% took one of the two options including <a href="http://www.usctrojans.com/">the Trojans</a>) to play for the national championship in the Sugar Bowl. I'm surely hoping they get in. They did get the number one spot in both major polls heading into the announcement show.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> LSU pushed passed us in the rankings via the difference in computer rankings by .16, 5.99 to 6.15!!! The BCS Coordinator, Mike Tranghese, was honest right up front in saying that he has no explanation that will satisfy USC fans. Once again, a team that couldn't even win its conference championship is going to play for the title. He's saying that we ought to expect some changes in the BCS system but not until their annual meeting of interested parties in April.</p>
<p>By their own rules, the winner of the BCS title game will be number one in the post-bowl ESPN/USA Today poll but the Trojans can still get a split with a win over Michigan in the Rose Bowl and some love from the AP voters. USC coach Pete Carroll (28-9 as head man) said all the right words as he was interviewed but his body language was nowhere near as serene as his voice; seemed clear to me that he was royally pissed.</p>
<p>With number four Michigan as the opponent, we all know that the Rose Bowl will be the real national title game in the days after New Years!</p>
<p><em>Extra:</em> I posted <a href="http://www.sportsfilter.com/comments.cfm/2507">my frustration(!)</a> to SpoFi too.</p>
