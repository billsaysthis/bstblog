<p>We were at the U2 concert tonight at the HP Pavillion. Awesome music, great stage and lighting design, I can still smell the weed my neighbors were getting toasting on. I had a stomach bug, though, and between our seats being pretty much at the top and in the middle of a row, the sound at a volume I'm just not used to any more and the concrete shaking, I was dizzy and naseous, thought the secondhand pot might relax my tummy but no dice. So we bought a couple of t-shirts (Viv got a black one with a big slashing V on the front) and a couple of buttons and called it a night as they played <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Bloody Sunday</span>. I would have been more upset but since we bought an extra pair of tickets and sold them for what the four cost me, and because Viv is such a sweetheart, I'm not. <span style="font-style:italic;">Vertigo</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">New Year's Day</span> were great to hear.</p>
