<p><b>Will Sun get a new life out of StarCat?</b></p>
<p>ZDNet is reporting that Sun Micro is preparing to <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t269-s2093917,00.html">launch StarCat for September</a>. StarCat is the codename for the new high-end UltraSparc III-based servers. Something better come along because Sun stock is down $2.64 to $10.79 this morning!!! StarCats will support up to 72 UltraSparc III 750 MHz chips (with 900 MHz and 1 GHz in the pipeline) divisible into 18 separate Solaris domains (that is, virtual servers) with 576 Gb of RAM--imagine how fast Quake would run on this box.</p>
