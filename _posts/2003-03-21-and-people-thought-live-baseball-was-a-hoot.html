<p>I realize everybody is seeing the same stuff, writing about it, talking about it but I find it amazing that CNN is broadcasting <em>live images</em> from a crew embedded with one of the American infantry units, the 7th Cavalry, racing north through the Iraqi desert. Followed by live images from Baghdad, where we can hear the noise of anti-aircraft fire. Just mindblowing, once again.</p>
