<p>George Carlin, RIP. The man put on some of the funniest shows, consistently, for over 40 years and now he goes, heart failure on a Sunday afternoon. What a bad start for any week!</p>
<p>Carlin and Cheech and Chong were the first two comic acts that I connected with as a teenager, with Richard Pryor not far behind. Routines like the seven words you can't say on TV and Dave's not here warped my mind in ways from which I've never recovered. And by hosting the first episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Night Live</span> Carlin gave that show instant credibility, giving that initial cast an opening they drove through like a Mack truck.</p>
<p>George kept giving us the good stuff over all these years, more through juicy supporting roles in movies (especially Kevin Smith flicks) but also with the occasional HBO special. A funny man, his death is a big withdrawal from the cosmic humor bank account.</p>
