<p>Steve J comes up with <a href="http://saladwithsteve.com/2003_03_01_archive_index.html#104714925231711194">the words</a> I've been pondering the last three or four days. Dave often has interesting linkage but way too often his commentary is far too self-serving and obviously absurd.</p>
<p><em>Update, 3/9:</em> Dave <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/03/09#wheresCindy">responds today</a> to Steve, criticizes Steve for not getting his facts straight (though I think many would disagree with this assessment), and then proceeds to get his own facts wrong. <em>Silly Dave!</em></p>
