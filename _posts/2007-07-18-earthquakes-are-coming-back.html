<p>News leaked out today that the San Jose Earthquakes <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_6396940">will be reborn</a> for the 2008 MLS season. No, the Dynamo have not made a u-turn on Houston, this is a new franchise that will be given the old name and results (a la the Cleveland Browns a few years back). Fortunately we won't be getting AEG back as owners either, but instead Lew Wolff, owner of the Oakland and soon to be Fremont A's, will operate an expansion squad.</p>
<p>This isn't a shock since Wolff has been negotiating with the city of San Jose and San Jose State over a stadium for some months though given the lack of progress on the facility the timing is a bit surprising. San Jose State wouldn't agree to the deal Wolff wanted and Plan B is generating controversy due to a grant of favorable zoning on a separate parcel.</p>
<p>I know myself well enough to say that this team will join Liverpool as my top favorites ASAP. I wonder who will join the squad, if Wolff will bring in a big name international to kickstart the engine. Maybe Fabio Capello, ex-Real Madrid and Italy trophy-winning coach who publicly said in the last week he's interested in coming to MLS, will be holding the reins? We can only hope to get some quality.</p>
