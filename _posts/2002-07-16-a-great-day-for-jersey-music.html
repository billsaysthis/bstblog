<p>Not only did we get <em>Into the Fire</em> but there's a new <a href="http://www.southsidejohnny.org/main.htm">Southside Johnny</a> release too. How lucky are we? Three songs you can listen to online:<br />

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.southsidejohnny.org/media/Passion%20Street.mp3">Passion Street</a> - the trademark Juke horns are blasting on this one! A bouncy, rolling good time story song.<br />
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.southsidejohnny.org/media/Still%20In%20Love.mp3">She's Still In Love</a> - classic R&amp;B guitar riff opening, then bass, then horns preceed Johnny's vocals on slick, sweet love song, so reminiscent of the old Philly International sound that Hall &amp; Oates only dreamed of capturing.<br />
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.southsidejohnny.org/media/No%20Easy%20Way%20Down.mp3">No Easy Way Down</a> - big time ballad, Johnny telling such a sad love story; a Goffin/(Carol) King cover song, must be from the early '60s.</li>
</ul>
<p>The album is titled <em><strong>Going to Jukesville</strong></em>:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/23cover.jpg" height="200" width="200" /></p>
<p>John gives us this hyperbole himself: "That low moaning sound you hear is music fans the world over sobbing in relief with the knowledge that their long, lonely wait is finally over. A real honest-to-Betsy JUKES record. With horns on every G-damn song. Horns, horns and more horns. Horns til ya wanna hurl yer lunch up. Well, at least I do. Yes, it's me; ole man Southside, fresh from slaving over a steaming 24 track Studer recording device, and I'm here to tell ya, this new hunk-o-plastic is about as Jukified as it can get without it being confiscated by the authorities."</p>
<p>No doubleheader on the concerts, though, as the closest the Jukes will get to Mountain View is Los Angeles in early September.</p>
<p>One of the few things, I tell ya, that can make me long for those Jersey Summer evenings back in high school!</p>
