<p><em>The Wire</em> is finished but <a href="http://www.fox.com/24/index.htm">24</a> is back Sunday night and you just might want to watch <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/csdesigns/24/S4xtrailer.html">this two and a half minute trailer</a> and read <a href="http://forums.prospero.com/n/mb/message.asp?webtag=fox24&amp;msg=54342.1">the transcript</a> of the DVD-only scene that explains Jack's exit from CTU to get in the mood. (Okay, HBO has the Season 2 premiere of <em>Carnivale</em> on as well. With Desperate Housewives starting a run of fresh episodes and NFL wild card playoff games, looks like a good day to ignore the weather and watch TV.)</p>
