<p>A buddy tipped me today to a new National Geographic Channel special, which will run this coming Monday night at 9, called <a href="http://www9.nationalgeographic.com/channel/fightscience/index.html">Fight Science</a> that you're almost certainly going to have to see. Check <a href="http://www9.nationalgeographic.com/channel/fightscience/videoPreview.html">the video preview</a> if you have any doubts, or read the show description:</p>
<p><em>"It strikes four times faster than a snake. It kicks with more than 1,000 pounds (453.59 kg) of force. And it can rival the impact of a 35 mph (56.33 kph) car crash. It's the most complex weapon ever designed&mdash;the human body. National Geographic Channel brings together a team of experts and a cross section of champion martial arts masters to analyze the world's greatest fighting techniques and find out which discipline has the hardest hits, the fastest moves, and even the deadliest weapons."</em></p>
<p>So they gave some scientists several hundred thousand dollars to go nuts on monitoring and sensor equipment, plus snap visualization software, and brought in a bunch of top practitioners of various fighting styles and let them go in the lab. With high-def, high speed cameras rolling all the time.</p>
<p>Very cool, the kind of intelligent thing one would expect from smart video journalists but in practice rarely see.</p>
