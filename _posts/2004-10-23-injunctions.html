<p>I was sitting in a room full of people<br />
<br />Everyone faced front, listening to the Man<br />
<br />Hearing his words, mesmerized by the tone<br />
<br />When I felt the room waver before me<br />
<br />My feet felt the floor swaying under me<br />
<br />I looked around the room but everyone<br />
<br />Was still intent on the speaker and no one<br />
<br />Seemed to have felt the earthquake as I did</p>
<p>This morning I woke up, coughed, and saw silver<br />
<br />Sparks in the air in front of my face<br />
<br />Little bits of airborne lint, silver, not truly<br />
<br />There though I watched them pop here and there,<br />
<br />For ten seconds at a time before they disappeared</p>
<p>Dramatic lines are drawn on the cavern walls<br />
<br />Ancient images of massive animals and the<br />
<br />Loved ones of the hunters, hunted all the same</p>
<p>The Man spoke volumes about his experience<br />
<br />Facinating stories about battles and conferences<br />
<br />Brave warriors fighting with financial instruments<br />
<br />Facing off with great legal minds protecting the<br />
<br />Flanks, enjoining the enemy stratagems</p>
<p>Gray suits may have replaced animal skins now<br />
<br />Computers and Mont Blanc replacing flints and lances<br />
<br />I don't care, they're all the same to me<br />
<br />No one else felt the Earth shake and I did</p>
