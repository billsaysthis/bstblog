<p>Now I can understand why a real estate developer like <a href="http://www.paloaltoonline.com/paw/paonline/news_features/fitzhugh/index.shtml">Kenneth Fitzhugh</a> would try and make up an excuse like his wife falling down the stairs to the basement to avoid a conviction but you'd think a published novelist like <a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=63-0671726951-1">Michael Peterson</a> would be able to figure out a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/national/AP-Writer-Wifes-Death.html">better cover story</a>.</p>
