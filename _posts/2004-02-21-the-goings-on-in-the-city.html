<p>I've been trying to think of the right words for my opinion on Gavin Newsom's campaign of civil disobedience for days now. <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/31336">This MetaFilter thread</a>, between the comments and the pictures and articles linked, does a pretty good job. Essentially, I see the whole thing boiling down to equal protection under the law versus religion-based opinions and in that fight the former wins by a knockout. And while the struggles have major differences, the 1967 Supreme Court decision that once and for all outlawed so-called <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary">miscegenation</a> in America seems just as applicable here. To the 50 or 60% of Americans who pollsters report do not believe that gay marriage ought to  legal, consider the operative verb in that sentence (here, I'll help you out: believe) and get over yourselves.</p>
