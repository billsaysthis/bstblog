<p><a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/posts/02/20020524">garret asks</a> if anyone is still interested in enlisting after reading about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/24/politics/24NERV.html">Navy nerve gas tests</a> in the '50s and '60s but he missed yesterday's biggest sports story: Arizona Cardinals safety Pat Tillman turned down a five-year, $9 million offer last summer to <a href="http://www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/sports/0502/0524tillman.html">enlist in the Army</a> for a three year tour along with his younger brother Kevin, a minor league baseball player. The Tillmans expect to serve in the elite Ranger unit and Pat was looking at the age limit (he would have been passed it by the time his next contract was finished) so it was either now or never. He hopes to return to the NFL when his service is over.</p>
