<p>Based on a <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/25381">MeFi thread</a>, a couple of months ago I signed up for free subscriptions to Maxim and Stuff. Amusing but not very readable--have no doubt that I am only interested in the photographs--so I used a made up name for their subscription rolls. Tom Stevens likes these kinds of magazines, I don't. There were assurances that these subscriptions were given only to bulk up the audited numbers they use to sell ad space and no third party marketing would be sent.</p>
<p>A bald faced lie, apparently, as Mr. Stevens has received his first piece of junk mail. Paper, not email, since I gave a completely useless email address at least. Chase Manhattan Bank thinks that Tom needs a credit card. Simple enough, everyone needs more of those, but for some reason Chase thinks a special credit card personalized with a photo of Tom's own pet would make him enthusiastic about a new piece of plastic.</p>
<p>So I think this could be very amusing, akin to the old stories about family pets getting onto marketing lists, and we'll be following the companies who want Stevens as a customer on his own page: <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/misc/ststevens.phtml">Selling Tom Stevens</a>.</p>
