<p>Zack Bronson broke a foot in last Monday's win against Seattle and is out for probably two months. This lead directly to New Orleans' going 10 of 14 on third down conversions, many of which required seven yards or more for first down and came on 12-16 yard completions by Aaron Brooks. Jamie Winborn and John Engelberger were out on injury as well. I knew Bronson (and the other two) would be missed but not this badly. You get outscored 22-3 in the fourth quarter, when the 22 could have been more but for two missed two point conversations, and you don't win.</p>
<p>Tai Streets had six receptions for 80 yards. Sounds nice except that Streets is not supposed to be the leading receiver on the Niners. TO is and he only had four catches (61 yards including the first touchdown) plus one piddling gain on an end around. We're not winning when the best offensive player gets the ball five times the whole game. Garcia was 23 of 39 for 275 yards but that's a dinky 7.05 yards per plus a crucial fourth quarter interception that sealed the loss. Add in Barlow's fumble and this was another example of "lose the turnover battle, lose the game" with the team going negative in this category for the first time all year.</p>
<p>The Saints did not punt once all game. Both teams had 159 yards in kickoff returns (the one SF punt was for no yards on the return) but the Saints got theirs on two fewer returns and had better starting position all day. Terry Jackson, special teams captain, was put on injured reserve four days with a torn ACL suffered in Seattle.</p>
<p>Arizona (3-2), Oakland (4-1), Kansas City (3-2), San Diego (5-1), and Philadelphia (3-2) are the next five games. Seems like the 49ers will need at least three wins to have a shot at the playoffs and four to match last season's 12-4 mark. Good luck to us.</p>
