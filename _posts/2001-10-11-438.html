<p><b>Ode to America: just another fake?</b></p>
<p>Well, LIEMails <a href="http://liemails.com/indexod.htm#odetoamerica">says</a> the Romanian editorial I posted a few days back is another email hoax. The site does point out that there is no attribution to a specific newspaper or publication date. However, I <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_10_07_blog_archive.phtml#6209672">published it</a> because of the sentiment expressed, which I agree with, rather than because of who wrote it or where it was published. On the other hand, the site does link to BillSaysThis as an example of the editorial, which is nice. Say whatever you want about me, just spell my name (or URL) right and print it often, to paraphrase the old PR man's saying.</p>
