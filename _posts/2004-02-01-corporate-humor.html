<p><em>Dear William Lazar,</p>
<p>Walgreens and Medco Health Solutions have reviewed pharmacy transactions related to your health benefits plan's prescription coverage from mid-1999 to early 2001. The review identified certain co-payments paid by you that could have been lower.</p>
<p>Therefore, consistent with Medco's and Walgreen's commitment to customer satisfaction, please accept the enclosed check to fully reimburse you for the difference.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
<br />Walgreens</em></p>
<p>The enclosed check was for 50 cents. W00t, I'm rich again.</p>
