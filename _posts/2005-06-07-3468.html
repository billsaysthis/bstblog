<p>Unlike the rest of the world I don't have a huge opinion about the news of <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/06/1752234&amp;from=rss">Apple switching to Intel</a>, would be fine if the move changes pricing, but I'm surprised more folks aren't having a laugh over the real twist in the announcement. After, all, isn't Microsoft moving to the IBM architecture for Xbox 360? Numerous technopundits have cited the game console as Redmond's less than covert attempt to cut out the middleman in a move to an Apple-like full system product.</p>
