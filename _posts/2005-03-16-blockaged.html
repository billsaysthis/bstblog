<p>I'm supposed to be at work already, a half hour into the day, but instead am sitting hear for a second morning in a row while a plumber attempts to clear a blockage in the main pipes in Ol' 67. Particularly annoying because the plumber sent yesterday by the dolts at American Home Shield wouldn't go on the roof, which seems necessary to correct this. When asked why a plumber wasn't sent from a company which would do roof work, the AHS rep claimed it wasn't their responsibility.</p>
<p>I really need to research home warranty companies to see if I can find one better rated than them when the policy is up for renewal in the fall. This reminded me of a recently posted Forbes article, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2005/03/07/cx_cw_0308hate_print.html">Top Corporate Hate Web Sites</a>, and so I see there is <a href="http://groups.msn.com/ConsumerComplaintCoalition/general.msnw?action=get_message&amp;mview=1&amp;ID_Message=138">no shortage</a> of <a href="http://thispageintentionallyleftblank.net/archives/003396.html">discontent</a> towards American Home Shield from others. The biggest problem I have with the company is the way they adhere to some internal rulebook like robots but refuse to share the rules with customers and second is the rules governing work done outside of normal business hours.</p>
<p>This problem happened on Saturday and we've been on pins and needles ever since that the next toilet flush or hand wash will put things over the edge and cause a big flood. Something similar happened a few years ago and we had to replace a big chunk of carpet and install some new pipes. The plumber's still got his power snake working, I hear it up on the roof, just keep your fingers crossed.</p>
<p>p.s. This plumber did the trick and in very little time. If only AHS had sent the call to his company in the first place, I'd be much happier.</p>
