<p>For a cheap date, we went to see <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0293815">Friday After Next</a> last night at the CinemaSaver over in Milpitas, $3 a ticket. Not a bad movie for the price but being stoned would have probably made it a lot funnier. Ice Cube and Mike Epps are back as the cousins, complaining about lack of money and a lack of honeys, and their dads are back, complete with bathroom jokes, partnered in a BBQ joint ("The food is so good you'll slap your momma" is their slogan).</p>
<p><em>Good for HBO</em></p>
