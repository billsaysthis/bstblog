<p>One of the core elements that defines childhood is the ability to build mental pictures of the world that seem logically complete as well as practical even though they are completely at odds with life as it really exists. Think of five year olds who just know their parents are perfect. Sad as it is, breaking through this mental wall is a big part of becoming an adult. Sherman Martin Austin, an 18 year old Angeleno found this out the hard way when an <a href="http://www.newsbytes.com/news/02/174092.html">FBI raid silenced his anarchist website</a> by raiding his parents' home with lots of armed agents. This quote makes my point precisely: "In the interview, Austin acknowledged that he vandalized the Web sites and that he knew it was illegal to do so. But he defended the act by saying it was necessary to get his message out." (Hmm is this my day to pick on teens?)</p>
