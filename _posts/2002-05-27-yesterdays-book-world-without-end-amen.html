<p>Jimmy Breslin has written about New York for nearly 50 years now, mainly in newspaper columns and occasionally in novels as well. His most famous novel was a comic tale of mobsters, "The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight," that was funny and entertaining. I came across "World Without End, Amen" in a second hand shop for $1.50 and figured I'd check it out. The problem is that Breslin has no story here, no real plot, he just follows a drunken Irish New York beat cop through some troubles and then onto a trip to the Old Country. Which is really a completely separate story that Breslin mainly uses as a showcase to display how terrible conditions are for Catholics in Northern Ireland, or at least how bad they were 30-odd years ago when the novel came out. He goes nowhere plotwise and even the most significant event takes place offstage. <em>Not recommended</em></p>
