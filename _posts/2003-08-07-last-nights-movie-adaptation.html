<p>Did you see <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120601">Being John Malkovich</a>? This movie is from the same writer (Charlie Kaufman) and same director (Spike Jonze) and takes the weirdness even further. As opposed to my buddy, I think it was weird in a good way though. I do wonder a bit if <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/adaptation-superbit/index.html">Adaptation</a> would have come out even better if they'd stuck with the same lead actor (John Cusack) though Nicholas Cage did get an Oscar nomination. I'm reluctant to say too much except that the actors and the director turned in very decent performances and the script is simply indescribable.</p>
<p><em>Recommended</em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JLRE/httpwwwbillsc-20">Buy the DVD at Amazon</a></p>
