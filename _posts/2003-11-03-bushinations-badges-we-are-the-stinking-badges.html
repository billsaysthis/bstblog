<p>Assuming <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/03/opinion/03GOLD.html?pagewanted=all&amp;position=">Francisco Goldman isn't stretching the truth</a> beyond all connection with reality, and I doubt he is, we now have a completely criminal state just south of our border in Guatemala. Some smart and ruthless characters have taken over the army and government, pretty much killing and torturing anyone who stands in their way, giving drug traffickers and, potentially, terrorists a protected haven a short plane ride away from America. So where is <a href="http://www.gwbush.com/index.shtml">President <del>Cheney</del>Bush</a> on this tragedy, where certainly American security is at stake?</p>
