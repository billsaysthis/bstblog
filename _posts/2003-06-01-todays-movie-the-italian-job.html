<p>Based on a trusted friend's recommendation, we saw <a href="http://www.italianjobmovie.com/flash/main.php?pchar=1">The Italian Job</a> today even though we thought the trailer showed so much plot it was spoiled. But...that's true and still not true. I mean, the trailer shows a lot more of the plot than I think is a good idea but the acting and execution is so good that it's worth $6.25 to see.</p>
<p>Mark Wahlberg is the lead in this film, though I'd have to say it's more of an ensemble outing than a star turn. Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green, Mos Def, and Jason Statham all have almost as big parts, it's just that Wahlberg plays the leader of the gang is the focus of the decisions taken. As my friend who recommended this said, Charlize Theron is the most perfectly beautiful woman in the movies these days, an added bonus. Norton is of course not the most attractive male actor of his generation but even so he ought to work more closely with the makeup department when he uses facial hair; here his mustache and soul patch are just cheesy and diminish his performance which is not at all a dairy product.</p>
<p>Director F. Gary Gray is having a decent year; <em>Italian Job</em> is his second major release following Vin Diesel's <em>A Man Apart</em>. He really does a nice job with the pacing here, tightening the action well but leaving room for humorous bits from Statham, Mos Def, and especially Green. Husband and wife writing team Wayne and Donna Powers took minimal help from the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0064505">original 1969 version</a> starring Michael Caine, creating memorable characters and set ups. The soundtrack has a terrific updated version of Pink Floyd's <em>Money</em>, though I can't find a listing to see who's done the recording.</p>
<p>I'd compare this movie quite favorable to the two other major recent heist films, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_07_15_blog_archive.phtml#4556421">The Score</a>, also starring Norton, and <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_11_11_blog_archive.phtml#7111124">Heist</a>. Both of those films (to be blunt) sucked, despite the superior casts, lacking a slightly important element called dramatic tension.</p>
