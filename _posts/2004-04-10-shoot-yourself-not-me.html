<p>If you can read <a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FD10Ad02.html">The year to fear for Taiwan: 2006</a> and can tell me afterwards your fear meter didn't move up a notch, you are lying. All these assholes with guns and bombs are really stupid, immature and a danger to us. And I mean everyone from the guy who owns a .22 for the range to the terrorist suicide bombers all the way on up to those big 'nucular' toys in Washington, Beijing and Moscow. I see all these weapons as just sad hangovers from people who can't get their heads around the idea of pleasure and happiness.</p>
