<p>I was jumping around the web this morning and <a href="http://jason.shellen.com">Jason Shellen</a> pointed to a whacky collection of <a href="http://www.317x.com">scanned album covers</a>. I was just goofing and looked at this saucy cover for <a href="http://www.317x.com/albums/a/laurindoalmeida/card.html">Acapulco '22</a> by <a href="http://alt.venus.co.uk/weed/music/salliterri/almeida.htm">Laurindo Almeida</a>. And I realized that these four lovely bikini-clad young women have nothing to do with Almeida or his Bossa Nova guitar music. Just another attempt by marketing meeps to use sex to move product.</p>
<p>Cause, you know, I always choose my beer/auto/music by which uses the sexiest women. Or not.</p>
<p>But I was also more than a little shaken by the song selection on this album: Hava Nagila, a Jewish folk tune; Miserlou, and American country folk tune, some songs I don't recognize and then a bunch of syrupy romantic ballads, More, Satin Doll, I Left My Heart in San Francisco, and What Kind of Fool Am I. I checked on Google but couldn't find any of these online. Wouldn't you want to hear a Bossa Nova version of Hava Nagila?</p>
