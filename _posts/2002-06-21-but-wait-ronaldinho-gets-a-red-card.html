<p>From the 58th minute, Brazil will be playing with 10 men. Ronaldinho put an elbow across the face of Danny Mills and kicked him as well. Brazilian players are milling around, arguing and it takes the bad boy over 90 seconds to start walking off the field. Is this the break England needs? And does this mean that, if Brazil keeps the lead, that one of their top players will be disqualified for the semifinals?</p>
