<p>Going for their second cup championship of the week, the score was <a href="http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N40588010517-0021.htm">Liverpool 5, Alaves 4</a> as an own goal from the Portuguese's side goalkeeper late in overtime brought Liverpool the UEFA Cup only three days after <a href="http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/match/season/2000-2001/may/134/press_reports/RP23962001050.html">winning the English FA championship</a> over Arsenal. The team won the Worthington Cup earlier this spring for the unprecedented treble. In late August, they'll face either Bayern Munich or Valencia in Monaco for the Super Cup. Finally, after a slow start in the current Premiership season, they look good for third place and an automatic bid to next season's Champion's League.</p>
