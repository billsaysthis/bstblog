<p>One of the core Blogger teammembers, Jason Shellen, <a href="http://www.shellen.com/2002_04_07_archive.shtml#75295735">became a father today</a>. Drew came out of the shoot at 9 pounds 4 ounces with a little extra fluid in his lungs but expected to be fine shortly, mama Allie is exhausted after 27 hours elapsed between hospital entry and Drew's debut. I've met Jason and he is a great guy who is totally kidding himself about getting sleep any time in the next few months. Mazel tov, Jason, and add my wishes that Drew have a long, healthy, happy life to what will surely be many more!</p>
