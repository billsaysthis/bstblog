<p>Great bit of dialog from <a href="http://www.scifi.com/firefly/characters/jayne/">Jayne</a> in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Message</span>, the episode of <a href="http://www.scifi.com/firefly/">Firefly</a> shown on SciFi today: "What'd y'all order a dead guy for?" Said in his typical deadpan, this is a perfect example of why the show was so good. I'd like to hear one line as good as that from shows that ran for much longer like <span style="font-style:italic;">Walker, Texas Ranger</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">According to Jim</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">Diagnosis: Murder</span>. Seriously, there are times when I just hate Fox plain and simple.  <span class="LessonTitle"></span></p>
