<p>Because some people refuse to go GUI: <a href="http://www.drdos.com/press/drdos.htm?rnd=1080254229353">DR-DOS 8.0 ships</a> [<em>via <a href="http://www.larkware.com/Articles/TheDailyGrind337.html">Larkfarm</a></em>]</p>
<p>The WB unveils <a href="http://batmanbegins.warnerbros.com/page.html">the new Batmobile</a> and boy are those tires big! Is it me or does the <a href="http://batmanbegins.warnerbros.com/">new bat logo</a> seem awfully LotR-influenced?</p>
<p>Why is ManU new boy Louis Saha <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/headlinenews?id=295802&amp;cc=5901">proclaiming</a> that Arsenal's Henry is better than teammate Van Nistlerooy? Trying to put a spur under his man's heels ahead of this weekend's FA Cup semi-final where the two will matchup and in which Saha cannot play? One can only hope. Then again, Saha is Henry's teammate on the French national side and perhaps looking to help his place ahead of Nicholas Anelka.</p>
<p>The decline of Western Civilization is nigh: a <em>Harvard professor</em> was so caught up in a 419 scam that <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/36699.html">he raised over $600k</a> from his fellows allegedly for SARS research that actually fed his own predators! Prof. Xu refuses to admit he himself was being victimized though he did admit his own fraud; guess that's typical of almost any ego.</p>
