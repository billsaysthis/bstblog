<p>Moondog says his number one--<em>number one!</em>--<a href="http://www.rocknrollvault.com/moondog.htm" title="Scroll down to bottom">overrated artist</a> is Bruce Springsteen. Moondog has a pretty cool website called The Rock 'n' Roll Vault, with lots of neat information and lists. But anyone can see that, with a couple of exceptions, one can switch his "favorite artists" list for the "overrated" one and have a much more accurate picture. I suppose it's all about taste, very subjective and personal, but how you say Jackson Browne and Manfred Mann are among your favorites and not <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/entertain/rating_bruce.phtml">love Springsteen</a>? I was surfing through his site, expecting to see Springsteen at any moment and when I didn't, used the site search to look him up. I found only two interesting mentions: the overrated list and a review of a book called <a href="http://www.rocknrollvault.com/more/bookreviews.htm">Flowers in the Dustbin</a>. The latter mention of Springsteen? "The remaining pages of Flowers in the Dustbin discuss Bruce Springsteen, punk rock and of course the loss of Elvis, none of which would have been missed."</p>
