<p>Oh yeah. K is back and splittin' wigs! Why <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/meninblack/">MIB2</a> got such bad reviews I can't tell you. It's not Spider-Man or The Bourne Identity, but it isn't a film where you walk out saying I want those two hours of my life back, either. I laughed and enjoyed it, maybe not quite as much as the original.</p>
<p>Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith have the same great chemistry as ever, with Jones putting Smith quickly in his place once he's back in action. Lara Flynn Boyle and Rosario Dawson are truly luscious as the bad and good girls, respectively. I like the worms but you can keep the dog and Patrick Warburton (sorry Patrick but your act never appealed to me on Seinfeld or The Tick either). David Cross was an inspired pick as Newton, the UFO fanatic video store owner, who gives a totally different comic feel--who else could get over the line "So what's with anal probing?" so, well, naturally?</p>
<p>Everyone loves Rick Baker's aliens. I have to agree, especially some of the scummy bad guys Boyle sends after the duo. Director Barry Sonnenfeld even uses one of Baker's creations, the alien called Creepy, to pay homage, sort of, to Dr. Arliss Loveless from his previous film <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120891">Wild Wild West</a>. I think that Smith plays much better off Jones than Kevin Kline.</p>
<p>Plus, you get to see <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/chubbchubbs/">Meet the Chubb Chubbs!</a> beforehand. Totally cute computer generated animated short with lots of your favorite science fiction characters thrown in.</p>
<p><em>Recommended for laughs</em></p>
