<p><strong>Dave is bored</strong></p>
<p>Dave, sometimes known as the <a href="http://winerlog.editthispage.com">winer</a>, gets oh so world weary in <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/01/17#l331da417ecd186a615c449b948df3835">today's Scripting News</a>: "A soundbite: Microsoft bores me. Open source bores me. Sun bores me." Sorry Dave. I know RU8 is neat and maybe even cool but for sure is not the only interesting thing going on in software these days.</p>
