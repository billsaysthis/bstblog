<p><strong>What makes a movie good?</strong></p>
<p>Britney Spears raises an interesting point as she <a href="http://www.zap2it.com/movies/news/story/0,1259,---10540,00.html">addresses 'Crossroads' critics</a>, Crossroads being the movie in which she has her first starring role. The critics are consistent in their negative reaction, as one would expect, going so far as to break out into laughter at screenings. Crossraods is not a comedy, though, and so Spears responds: "Everything the critics like, I hate."</p>
<p>What does make a good movie? Why do critics so often despise the movies that audiences love? I'm no fan of Britney's music although I love to look at her dance but I see her point. This is, of course, an old argument between a self-appointed elite and the teeming masses. Britney makes her money while the critics enjoy their mockery and everyone gets paid in their own way.</p>
