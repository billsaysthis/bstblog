<p>We look back at ages long gone to dust<br />With wonder at the many myths<br />Those people swallowed so easily<br />Taking colorful tales as passed down truth.</p>
<p>Fanciful words sung to the tune of<br />Sweet lute pluckings by a stranger<br />Newly come over the high mountains<br />Taken as true as the color of a mother's eyes.</p>
<p>A boy comes down from a Summer<br />Herding sheep in the far pastures<br />His wild stories born of months' loneliness<br />Take illegitimate place next to mother's truth.</p>
<p>Stories first crafted to gender delight<br />Generations before eventually morph<br />With only the magic and power of time<br />Taken as forefathers' delivered, preserved truth.</p>
<p>Still today, beyond all science and ken,<br />Such illogical stories, tales and fancies--<br />Only for their age and none else--are<br />Taken by the masses as gospel truth.</p>
