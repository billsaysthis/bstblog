<p>No sooner do I put up <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_01_12_blog_archive.phtml#90194159">a summary</a> than Jacksonville, probably hoping to avoid any press headaches over Mariucci speculation, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2003/0116/1493632.html">names</a> Jack Del Rio as their new head coach. The team is also expected to finalize Baltimore Ravens scouting director Phil Savage as the new GM. Del Rio was an outstanding middle linebacker in college at USC and in the pros with the Saints and Vikings and, in his first year as a defensive coordinator anywhere, took the Carolina Panthers defense from last to second best in the league.</p>
<p>On the Mooch watch, latest rumor is that he will take his SF severance of $2.25M for the coming year and relax, spend time with his kids, and perhaps do some television commentary. All the NFL openings this year, less his last perch, are closed now unless the Saints or Lions make a move. Although the Mercury News sports section was filled with talk of Mike Holmgren wriggling out of his contract in Seattle to reunite with his old boss Bill Walsh and take the Niners job. Mooch could head north to Paul Allen's team, kind of a swap. Some Green Bay fans are posting to message boards that the team should dump Mike Sherman and grab Mariucci given Sherman's playoff record but you know that ain't gonna happen.</p>
