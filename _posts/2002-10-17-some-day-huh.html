<p>On the one hand, Sun Microsystems stock price was up nicely today (+ $0.19) and is continuing higher in the initial after hours trading (+ $0.16 more) and, definitely for worse, it's still my biggest holding. But the reason for this movement is news that the company will layoff 11% of the staff, about 4,300 people. And I still have quite a few friends working there. I sure hope they all miss out on the severance packages.</p>
<p>On the third hand, I am sick. Started with a sore throat last night and added naseau and general tiredness today. I went to the gym this morning after dropping the Sweet One at her train and did my standard aerobic workout on the Life Extension machine but just have had no energy. I'm supposed to revise my resume based on some very good, very specific suggestions but I don't have the will power.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Blogger system lost this post the first time I wrote it. I know many authors like to write, rewrite, publish, then rewrite again, but I am generally a point and fire kind of guy. Also, and I don't want to make too much of a fuss, but I am sick today.</p>
<p>Plus, I need a shave. Badly!</p>
