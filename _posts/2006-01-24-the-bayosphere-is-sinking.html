<p>From Dan Gillmor: <a href="http://bayosphere.com/blog/dan_gillmor/20060124/from_dan_a_letter_to_the_bayosphere_community">A Letter to the Bayosphere Community</a>. In this entry Dan explains why his vision for local media failed. Some people will lead off a remark with "I hate to say I told you so but..." Me, on the other hand, I have no problem with it. Although I wrote <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2005_05_08_blog_archive.phtml#111609106938741374">a mildly positive blog entry</a> back in May with the public launch, I never quite understood how the company planned to attract the 'citizen journalists' it expected to provide the bulk of the site's material. I never read of any incentives offered other than a free publishing platform, but there are plenty of those and most offer a good deal more functionality than Bayospere. Good try, worth doing, but I just don't see evidence that Gillmor, his partners and backers ever thought this all the way through.</p>
