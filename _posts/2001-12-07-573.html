<p><strong>Microsoft Research</strong></p>
<p>Does it sound like an oxymoron? It shouldn't. The boys in Redmond have a <a href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/">huge organization</a>, over 680 scientists on staff with five campuses globally, that does <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,74206,00.asp">lots of cool, basic stuff</a>. I had the pleasure of attending the Microsoft's Silicon Valley Speaker Series presentation by MS Research head honcho Rick Rashid this past Monday (of course I meant to write it up sooner but its that damn ATT at fault again). Read the linked article and the MS Research site, they are working on an academic basis with an emphasis on publishing and lots of it. Rashid was very open, a good, refreshing speaker. Plus they bought us off with a free lunch.</p>
