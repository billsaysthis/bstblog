<p>Okay, I'm just sitting here surfing the web and I <a href="http://msn.espn.go.com/nfl/news/2002/0215/1333343.html">see on ESPN</a> that now the Buccaneers have asked the 49ers permission to talk with Steve Mariucci. Man did I get a good laugh on that! Our lovable Mooch has two years left on his contract and so signing him would cost the Bucs something. Al Davis drove a hard deal, too hard, to let Gruden out of <em>one year</em> of a contract, so why would John York and Terry Donahue let their coach go for less? And why would Mooch want to go to Tampa Bay anyway? I can only think of two reasons, neither compelling: to get away from Terrell Owens and to be both coach and general manager. TO may be a little bit strongwilled but he sure delivers a lot more than Tampa Bay's star wideout, Keyshawn Johnson, and the 49ers have a quarterback who can pass the ball too. True, with the 49ers, Mariucci will probably need to wait years, maybe four or five, before Donahue would be willing to give up the GM slot but one would think that a bigger say for the coach in personnel matters would suffice in the near term. Tampa Bay will be needing a new GM shortly though, that much is clear after Rich McKay <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/columns/pasquarelli_len/1332921.html">interviewed</a> for the Atlanta GM opening. Come on guys, I <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_02_10_blog_archive.phtml#9698651">already made it clear</a> why you should hire me for the job. And I promise to stop laughing as soon as I get that contract in hand!</p>
<p><em>Update 10 p.m.</em>: The 49ers <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2002/0215/1333343.html">gave the Bucs permission</a> to talk to Mariucci, saying that Tampa Bay's willingness to name him coach and general manager (as predicted above) "because this is an opportunity that is unique." A decision is due early next week.</p>
