<p>Just finished watching the Fiesta Bowl with Ohio State needing two overtime drives to beat Miami 31-24. What a game! On any given day, the Trojans might be able to beat either of these teams but you have to give the Buckeyes and the Hurricanes credit. A big disapointment as I was rooting for a very large Hurricane margin of victory but Ohio State made plays on defense--interceptions, forced fumbles, and, finally, a goal line stand that ended the year in college football. USC, regardless of the ass kicking they gave Iowa <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_12_29_blog_archive.phtml#90136303">last night</a>, cannot and will not move ahead of either team in the final rankings. Congratulations to the Buckeyes for the win and to Miami for an awesome season.</p>
