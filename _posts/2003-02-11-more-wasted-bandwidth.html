<p>No matter what your political perspective, there are plenty of authentic issues to get lathered up about. And I'm sure there are very few Americans who couldn't find problems with the machinery of how our federal government operates.</p>
<p>So when an email comes along, with very serious and seemingly factual wording about how our Senators and Representatives have voted themselves a bountiful pension program--no matter how long or how short a time you serve in either house, you get (for starters) annual pension payments equal to your salary of the last year in office, plus cost of living raises--you find the message very easy to believe. Especially if the message is sent to you from a very credible source. I know I bought into it, even went so far as to write my duly elected trio.</p>
<p>But I should have known to check out Snopes' <a href="http://www.snopes.com/index.html">Urban Legends Reference Pages</a> first. They always have the clue. And so they did on <a href="http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/outrage/pensions.htm">Congressional Pensions</a> too. No such pension plan exists, just another wacky concoction of an idiot with email and less than half a brain. Remember to check out the fantastic stories you see before you too fall victim!</p>
