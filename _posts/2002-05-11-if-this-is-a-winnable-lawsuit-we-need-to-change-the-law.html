<p>The Washington Times is reporting that the <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20020511-9699493.htm">families of 11 dead illegals to sue U.S.</a>. That is, 11 people who died while attempting to illegally enter the United States from Mexico, across the desert in Arizona, and their families are now suing our government. The families claim that a failure to put fresh water stores out in the desert, where tighter controls were forcing the migrants, contribued to their deaths.</p>
<p>I say, so what if it did? Not to be heartless but why is our government financially liable when people from another country choose to violate our laws and are then killed or injured in the attempt? And how did the attorneys come up with the number of $3.75 million per person anyway? In any event, the attorneys are stretching facts to meet their needs--what a shock--so I wonder if this will end us anything more than another publicity stunt to help people who break our laws.</p>
<p>This is a serious pushbutton issue for me, as I've <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_01_06_blog_archive.phtml#8522780">written before</a> more <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_01_27_blog_archive.phtml#9135755">than once</a>. This is America, we welcome many immigrants with open arms, but only if you come on our terms.</p>
