<p>Atkins Nutritionals stopped making their blueberry muffin mix the way we liked it several months ago, more than doubling the carbs in the new formulation, and now our stash of the old mix is finished. A woman at the company said to just use the pancake mix and add fresh blueberries to get the same result. TS1 made our first batch of them tonight and the taste test is scheduled for breakfast tomorrow.</p>
