<p><b>Sun: Java is a good investment</b><br />

<p>Speaking at the JavaOne conference, Sun COO Ed Zander <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/010604/n04219526_2.html">defended Sun's Java investment</a> as driving hardware revenues. He's absolutely correct; there are many, many customers buying Sun hardware to run written in Java server-based applications. In the <a href="http://www.appserver-zone.com/">application server market</a>, with which I am of course <a href="http://developer.iplanet.com/tech/appserver/">most familiar</a>, substantially all deployments are on Sun hardware. While dotcoms are generally falling by the wayside, this technology is surging through many other sectors of the economy and there is much more money to be had here.</p>
