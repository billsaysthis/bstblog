<p><b>Is a third front opened?</b></p>
<p>This is scary. Workers found enough C4 to <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/news/101901_nw_c4.html">blow up the Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal</a>. All they found was a block the size of a bar of soap, one third of a pound, and this would have been enough to destroy the bus terminal and, I expect, kill everyone inside. There was about 1,000 feet of detonation cord in the luggage but no detonators. I tried to find a good link for C4 but mostly turned up sites explaining how it's used as the explosive inside landmines all over the world.</p>
<p>Fortunately the explosive was not rigged up as a bomb and in fact was found by terminal maintenance workers who clear out expired storage lockers. The luggage the C4 was in was apparently taken out of a locker two weeks ago and left in a closet until today. This link goes to a local Philadelphia TV station and the page includes the video clip with their story as well.</p>
