<p>Just sending some love to my wonderful <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/vivroar/blogger.html">TS1</a> on the third anniversary of the first night we went out together. Boing boing boing, Baby V! Got to say thanks to my old NetD buddy Joel Henderson because if he hadn't invited me up for a little Halloween Peanuts viewing I'd probaly never have met her. We went for dinner at Cha Cha Cha's in The Haight early, a little stroll in the drizzle under a shared umbrella and then over to Joel's apartment where we sat on the couch and held hands. To commemorate the day, she gave me a really lovely handmade photobook with some highlights of our time together.<br /></p>
