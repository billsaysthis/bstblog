<p>I've watched eight of the first 11 matches from Germany--you're surprised I missed three, right?--and 11 hours later I'm still mystified by the play of our team today. They lost 3-0 to the Czech Republic. The Czechs are ranked number two by FIFA and the US five so even if you give credence to those numbers a loss isn't that surprising.</p>
<p>The loss, then, isn't mystifying. They brought some real bruisers and a few world class players like Pavel Nedved, Tomas Roszicky and Jan Koller. Peter Cech in goal is usually mentioned in the world's best goalies list (as is our own Kasey Keller) but my assessment is still open since the defense in front of him at Chelsea FC is so amazing he faces far fewer difficult shots than pretty much any other major club keeper; this tournament is Cech's chance to show he deserves the accolades. Ranked second or not, I think the only satisfying end to this month for the Czechs is to life the trophy or else barely lose to Brazil.</p>
<p>Back to the US Men. The first problem was they all played like a dozen polka bands were playing overlapping amplified sets outside the team hotel all night. Bruce Arena put Damarcus Beasley on the right wing and I can't remember the last time he played on that side, certainly he didn't in any of the qualifying games. Bobby Convey, Eddie Lewis and Claudio Reyna were never able to provide supply into Brian McBride, Eddie Johnson or Landon Donovan.</p>
<p>The heart of the offense, the real engine, for the last five years has been Donovan, who was just somewhere else the whole game. Maybe it was his disastrous ten weeks with German club Bayern Leverkusen 18 months ago but since then he hasn't seemed like the same player who took the Earthquakes to the 2003 MLS trophy. For a player who used to score nearly every time out, he's gone 16 matches now without a goal.</p>
<p>If we're to have any chance of getting out of the group round Donovan needs to find the old magic. Beasley needs to be back on the left, racing up to get the ball deep into the offensive third and putting it into Landon, McBride or Johnson. Oguchi Onyewu needs to shake off the Koller goal and early yellow card. Eddie Johnson (or can I hope Brian Ching) needs to be in the starting lineup, with Pablo Mastroeni left on the bench. Maybe Clint Dempsey on the right instead of Convey.</p>
<p>Most of all, Bruce Arena needs to get the guys a good night's sleep.</p>
