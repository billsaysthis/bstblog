<p>Subaru uses <a href="http://www.newspeakdictionary.com/ns-prin.html">Newspeak</a> to make its Outback sedan a "light truck," thereby <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/13/automobiles/13SUBA.html?hp">avoiding stiffer mileage and pollution controls</a>. In other words, more corporate bullshit to take advantage of legal loopholes put there by big dollar lobbying but justified as helping some small disadvantaged groups (in this case so farmers and small businesses would be able to afford trucks).</p>
