<p>Just wrong: The <i>New York</i> Times previews the possibility of the Giants and Jets meeting in the Super Bowl in an article entitled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/31/sports/football/31ANDE.html?8hpib">Subway Bowl Definitely a Can-Do</a>. Subway Bowl my ass! Neither team has played a home game in the state or city of New York in over 20 years but the fans and team executives refuse to accept reality. I remember that back in the '80s there was a push in the NJ state legislature to require any team playing its home games in a facility owned by the state to use NJ in their official designation. The Jets, especially, panicked and brought all the muscle they could to bear on the politicians, and the issue died. But to go so far as to call this a possible Subway Bowl is absurd even for the Times! Wouldn't the New Jersey Bowl be more appropriate?</p>
