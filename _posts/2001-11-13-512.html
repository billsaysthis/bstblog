<p><b>Reason to love the web, part {next}</b></p>
<p>Evan points us to <a href="http://www.earlyamerica.com/towncrier/index.html">Archiving Early America</a>, a website that provides a "unique array of original newspapers, maps and writings come to life on your screen just as they appeared to our forebears more than 200 years ago." The site, an excellent resource for students, has short historical films, a large number of important documents, discussion forums, and hosts the online version of The Early America Review (a scholarly journal). Although there is no About Us page to give full credits, this nicely designed site appears to be the work of archivist D.E. Vitale; Joshua R. Greenberg wrote a <a href="http://www.publichistory.org/reviews/December2000/earlyamerica.html">good academic review</a> of the site for the Public History Resource Center.</p>
