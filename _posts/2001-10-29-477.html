<p><b>Even cowboy coders get the blues</b></p>
<p>Joel Spolsky is emerging as an important voice in software development. Currently, his company is in the beta test phase with a <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/stories/storyReader$389">new product</a> and he's journaling his experiences. In <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/stories/storyReader$412">Working on CityDesk, Part Four</a>, he discusses one of the horrors of the modern developer's life: relying on someone else's code library. Although he doesn't make the connection, it's clear to me that if he were using an <a href="http://www.justlinux.com/">open source environment</a> instead of Windows and Visual Basic he would be able to resolve the specific problem gracefully instead with a hack. OTOH, using Windows does offer somewhat better opportunity for an <a href="http://www.valinux.com">actual profit</a> so one cannot be too harsh in <a href="http://slashdot.org/">criticizing</a>.</p>
