<p><strong>Steven explains why America isn't signing treaties</strong></p>
<p>A curious European fellow named Maurice wrote Steven (has it been a month since I <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_11_11_blog_archive.phtml#7206288">linked to him</a>?) and asked why Americans think Europeans are against them in the current struggle while the Europeans seem to feel it is the Americans who aren't team players when it comes to many recent international agreements. Steven's <a href="http://denbeste.nu/entries/00001609.shtml">answer</a> is simple and direct. The treaties in question--Kyoto and the international court of justice--violate the US Constitution. The President can't sign such treaties without violating his oath of office and the same goes for Senate ratification should a president be foolish enough to sign. Excellent analysis.</p>
<p>James Morrow, writing in Reason, <a href="http://www.reason.com/hod/jm121101.shtml">looks at</a> a similar question from another perspective.</p>
