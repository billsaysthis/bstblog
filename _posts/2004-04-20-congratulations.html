<p>Another of my family members, my second cousin Kim, is <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~tgustavson/Todd&amp;Kim.html">getting married</a> this Summer. Right here in Los Altos but we really aren't that close so I'm not surprised, or disappointed, that we aren't invited. I'm real glad for her mom and dad (Hi Martin and Wendy!) and many happy years together to Kim and Todd.</p>
