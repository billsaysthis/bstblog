<p>Mark Cuban, <a href="http://www.hd.net/">content</a> <a href="http://www.nba.com/mavericks/">owner</a>, <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/1234000230037801/">comes out against</a> the MPAA/RIAA battalions ahead of Monday's <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/2005/03/mgm_v_grokster.html">MGM vs. Grokster</a> hearing at SCOTUS; in fact he announces in this post that he financed the EFF's work on the case. I like reading Cuban's blog because he's one of the few truly wealthy people in the world who puts his opinions out in the ether regularly without first filtering the words through the <a href="http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/" title="Not a bad blog but suffers by comparison here">PR/legal filter</a>. Sometimes he runs on a bit, writing isn't his primary skill, sometimes he talks too much about basketball and sometimes he's just a bit too obviously biased by self-interest. Then you get entries like this one. Totally cool.</p>
