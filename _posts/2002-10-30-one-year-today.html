<p>Talk about making me happy. Never had anyone like the Sweet One before in my life. The way she treats me, a great listener, always taking care of me, just finding little ways to make me happy. Given the other major ongoing situation in my life just now, being unable to find a job for 15 months, her love is an amazing contrast and allows me to be happy when otherwise I would not be. Especially the hot breakfasts every Saturday and Sunday and the foot massages.</p>
<p>Thanks Vivian, this Bill's for you!</p>
