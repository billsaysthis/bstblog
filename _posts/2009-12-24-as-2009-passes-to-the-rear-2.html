<p>So 2009 is ending, and more with a petering out than excitement and cheer. I'm in a summing up mood, so here goes.
<div></div>
<div>Sydney: This little puppy has definitely been a high point. He is very 2009, sporting his own albeit not too active <a href="http://twitter.com/lilsydneyroo">Twitter account</a>. Five months old now so probably close to his full growth at about a dozen totally cute pounds. He needs to learn to stop whimpering incessantly to try and get what he wants.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Kachingle: This <a href="http://www.kachingle.com">startup</a> has been another one for the plus column. I really enjoyed spending a few months writing heads-down Rails code and am now in the marketing team, as originally intended. If I got one holiday wish I would use it to get the angel funding round we're actively seeking--if you know anyone looking to invest in a very new, web-oriented revenue system please speak up!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Family: Everyone is in reasonably good health or better. Mom and Dad are enjoying life in the Princeton area, though we didn't get to see them this year due to work and scheduling issues. Joanne, Larry and Jake got a new custom-built house but had to postpone the trip here this coming week as my bro got a last minute work emergency he had to stay and clear. We finally saw most of TS1's siblings the week before last--hope to meet our first grandnephew soon!</div>
<div></div>
<div>House: Put in a new fence back in February but didn't start on the new landscaping. With luck this will get going in February or March. With help from the Big Guy I put in some floor-level venting in the garage, which got us a major reduction in the flood insurance. Obama gave us a hand too, with his mortgage program getting us a 75 basis point rate reduction.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://jhtc.org">JHTC</a> and Volunteering: Not sure where I'll score this. We had 12 really good monthly events but the board is having serious communication issues that brought me down a lot throughout the year. My planned rewrite of the website in Rails didn't get finished. And 2010 membership renewals are just not happening, sadly. On a positive note I had a couple of meetings at the beautiful new Oshman Family JCC and will be helping as they rebuild their web presence.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Travel: Besides not going to Jersey in June we didn't take a single plane ride or stay in any hotels. For 2010 we have to get to see my folks and are looking for a dog-friendly California resort to use our timeshare week, preferably in the Summer.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I hope you and your loved ones are happy and healthy and become only more so in the new year. L'chaim!</div>
