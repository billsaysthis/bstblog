<p>Props to the leaders of National People's Action, or whichever of them thought this up, but a bunch of protestors <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31890-2004Mar28.html">took their placards and chanting</a> to the home of chief Bush advisor Karl Rove yesterday and got right in his face. I would love to see some <del>news</del>video footage of this event, especially the bit at the end where Rove was screaming in the poor woman's face. Great idea, something liberal protestors ought to do more of--right wingers, particularly anti-abortion protestors, have been doing this for years.</p>
