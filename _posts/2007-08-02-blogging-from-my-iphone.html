<p>I've had this little gem for 10 days now and its sweet, even addictive. TS1 and I tried them out a week before and the pressure was on! She got a chunk of OT and we're switching off the landline soon to make this better fit our budget plus we got 4GB models.</p>
<p>Typing this much on the virtual keyboard is a bit of a strain on my patience so I'll finish up at home later with more early assessment.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Later:</span></p>
<p>Best things about it:
<ul>
<li>Maps! Not having to carefully copy down driving instructions or kill trees to print them out is wonderful for me.</li>
<li>Email everywhere. Although this is a bit addicting and perhaps dangerous at red lights.</li>
<li>4GB for music, compared to 1GB on the iPod I won from Krugle, and cuts down on listening to commercials on FM radio.</li>
<li>Free time filler. Waiting on line, at the doctor's office, wherever.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not great things:
<ul>
<li>Safari does not remember logins, presumably something to do with cookies</li>
<li>Typing, as mentioned above, is a learning process (hopefully)</li>
<li>Mail does not have bulk actions such as mark all read or delete all</li>
<li>GMail, which is one of my two main email accounts, STILL does not support IMAP; this is obviously to Google and not Apple but until now hasn't been an issue for me</li>
</ul>
<p>Unclear items:
<ul>
<li>Wifi connectivity strength seems to vary even if the phone is sitting on a table top</li>
<li>Music app loses its place (that is, which song was played last) and one cannot pick a specific song but have shuffle mode choose tracks afterwards</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall we're very happy to have bought the iPhones, even if they're a little more expensive than we'd like especially since my Apple friends cannot buy at their normal discount.</p>
<p>Good for a laugh: Even though I've gotten at least two software updates on my MacBook since the iPhone was released, the OS X system spellchecker still shows iPhone as a misspelled word. Then again, MacBooks have been out much longer and the spellchecker flags it as bad too.</p>
