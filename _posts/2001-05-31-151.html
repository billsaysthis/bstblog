<p><b>Today's Book: War Day</b><br />

<p>Remember those glorious days in 1984, when Reagan and the Evil Empire battled over <a href="http://www.armscontrol.ru/start/publications/dkp0731.htm">M.A.D.</a>ness? And the pain and suffering that began in late October of 1988, when the USSR unleashed a surprise nuclear attack before we could deploy our <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A9632-2001Apr27.html" title="Bush Jr. still wants one">missile shield</a>? The millions who died on that day and in the aftermath, from radiation and diseases like the Cincinnati Flu that were too strong for our undernourished bodies? Well, <a href="http://www.unknowncountry.com/" title="His official website, but no mention of this book">Whitley Strieber</a> and James Kunetka travelled what's left of America in 1993, gathering impressions, rumors, interviews, and official documents, making their way as best they could under then-current conditions.</p>
<p>That's what this novel attempts to present. Written in 1983, when there was still a Soviet Union and the American public had a kind of background fear, as I remember it, of a nuclear exchange. The book is told in a more or less matter of fact, semi-journalistic style, a travelogue of a ravaged but recovering America (the Soviets didn't get to drop too many warheads but did unleash an electronics-killing EMP burst). Though the authors try to engage the emotions, including a scene when a thousand orphans are hung out to dry in Georgia and another when Strieber visits his abandoned Manhattan apartment, I don't think they quite succeeded. An interested and engaging book but one that suffers from the common problem of lack of am emotionally satisfying resolution.</p>
<p>Oddly, Strieber's web site doesn't mention this book and I can't find a site for Kunetka.</p>
