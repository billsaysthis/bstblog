<p><b>Religion's misguided missiles</b></p>
<p>Richard Dawkins is professor of the public understanding of science, University of Oxford, and author of The Selfish Gene, wrote this <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4257777,00.html">Guardian Unlimited article</a> that slices right to the heart of the suicide pilots last week:</p>
<p>"If death is final, a rational agent can be expected to value his life highly and be reluctant to risk it. This makes the world a safer place, just as a plane is safer if its hijacker wants to survive. At the other extreme, if a significant number of people convince themselves, or are convinced by their priests, that a martyr's death is equivalent to pressing the hyperspace button and zooming through a wormhole to another universe, it can make the world a very dangerous place."</p>
