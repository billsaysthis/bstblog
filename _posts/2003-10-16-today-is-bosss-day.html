<p>Don't forget to be especially nice to the person who torments you all year long. A card would be particularly nice if you can find one that has the correct sentiment, perhaps something along the lines of "Who the fuck do you think you are, you mean-spirited, uncouth bastard [or bitch, if your boss is female]? Don't you understand I have a family and things to do that aren't connected to your quarterly and annual plans? You would if you had a heart instead of that coal-stoked furnace in your chest!"</p>
