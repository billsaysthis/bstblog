<p>[This email came through on one of the job lists I get today and seems worthy of a more permanent posting.]</p>
<p>A trusted member of the KIT List brought his recent job interview experience my attention in the hope of warning other KIT members who may be exposed to the same (or similar scams).  Thankfully, that particular job didn't come from the KIT list!</p>
<p>In this tough economy, there are predators out there who are hoping to take advantage of people who are desperate for jobs.</p>
<p>BEWARE of any company asking you to pay a fee up front to be qualified as a potential job candidate, or if you need to pay for your own training.</p>
<p>Also, there are some companies that are basically pyramid schemes that are setting up shop (check to see how long the company has been in their offices!), and instead of interviewing the prospective job candidates, they are "pitching" them with their sales scheme.  In some cases, you need to bring in a number of customers (meaning, your own friends and family) for loan refinancing and other financial services, and you will get a percentage of the deal.  These are pontentially very dangerous since they can set up what looks to be a legitimate company, relieve everyone of their money (and retirement), and close up and disappear into the night.</p>
<p>While there are mostly legitimate companies out there, please be very cautious of anyone asking for investment money of your own, or of those you know.</p>
<p>Just please be sure to scrutinize potential employers, and if you have a gut feeling that something is not right, trust your instincts and check everything out thoroughly.  In the cases that you feel there are serious abuses, please save others from getting trapped by reporting those companies to the appropriate authorities.</p>
