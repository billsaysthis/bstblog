<p>Roger Moore plays Bond for the fourth time (out of seven) in 1979's amiable, enjoyable <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0079574">Moonraker</a>. 007 faces off against megalomaniac (aren't they all?) aerospace industrialist Hugo Drax in a French estate transplanted into desert California, Venice, Rio de Janiero, and finally outer space. Drax aims to eradicate the vast masses of humanity, save for an elite, beautiful set of mostly white people he takes aboard his secret space station, who with their perfect children will repopulate an Earth ruled by a Drax dynasty. Moore is a suave, sophisticated hero, with luscious women falling into his arms in bare moments, though none really challenges him, not even the moderately attractive Lois Chiles as CIA agent/astronaut Dr. Holly Goodhead. Michael Lonsdale essays a strong, unconsciously arrogant Drax and Richard Kiel once again taunts Bond as Jaws (and yes, this is the movie in which Jaws falls in love with the petite, breastful Dolly).</p>
<p>More reasons why this is a good Bond: Lewis Gilbert directs for the third time, John Glen edits for the third time (and then steps up to direct the next five Bonds), and Christopher Wood does his second turn writing. Corinne Clery is luscious and too soon dead as Drax's helicopter pilot. Q's wrist nerve gun. Jaws turns good for his woman. Bond in Outer Space! <em>Recommended</em></p>
