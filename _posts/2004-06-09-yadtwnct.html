<p>One of my 'in your dreams' dreams has long been to join Springsteen's band as YANGP (Yet Another guitar Player, since now there are already four). Another has been to create and lead an equity group that takes private a sizable public company. With <a href="http://www.fender.com/home.html">Fender Musical Instruments</a>--makers of the guitar Bruce plays--now <a href="http://news.ft.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=FT.com/StoryFT/FullStory&amp;c=StoryFT&amp;cid=1086445515433&amp;p=1012571727108">up for sale</a>, I could combine both in one exciting impossible swoop!</p>
