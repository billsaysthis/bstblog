<p><b>Today's Movie: Kiss of the Dragon</b><br />

<p>Jet Li plays a Chinese cop assigned to Paris as liasion on a drug investigation but is set up to be the patsy by the French flic with whom Li has been sent to work in the thriller <a href="http://www.kissofthedragon.com/kod.html">Kiss of the Dragon</a>. Although I'd initially been put off by a nasty review in the <a href="http://www.bayarea.com/entertainment/movies/sfweekly.html" title="This is the review on their web page">San Jose Mercury News</a>, we headed to the movies on a whim and decided to see if anyway. Glad we did, despite the bad press, because I thoroughly enjoyed it. <a href="http://www.luc-besson.com/" title="Hope you read French">Luc Besson</a>, who wrote and produced this, also made the excellent films <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0100263">La Femme Nikita</a> and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0110413">The Professional</a>.</p>
