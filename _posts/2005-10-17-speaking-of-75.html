<p>Ahead of the November 15 release of the 30th Anniversary Edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Born to Run</span> Amazon has the title track video (from the included Hammersmith Odeon concert DVD) on the front page today. Awesome to watch, I was mesmerized and reminded of why I fell so hard for Bruce's music. This is primal Bruce, still skinny, fuzzy and honestly amazed at his success.</p>
<p>No acoustic guitars to be seen, no one but Bruce with a microphone and only the stylishly dressed Big Man pushing up into the spotlight. He's wearing that wool knit cap, almost everyone except Max Weinberger has some kind of hat on, a gold earring and the scraggly beard. Springsteen was only 25 on the night of this concert! Man, this is one CD I'm jazzed to be getting on the first day, oh yeah!</p>
<p>(If it's not on the front page, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000BJS4OY/qid=1129563719/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/002-7431564-3795210?v=glance&amp;s=music">try this album page</a> to see the video.)</p>
