<p>Let's just all give a little thanks that sound thinking prevailed in Hollywood yesterday and the Simpsons voice cast made a deal with the producers. I didn't see any financial details but the contracts are for four years (w00t!) and next season will see a full 22 episodes rather than the rumored 16 or 18 due to the late start. Hope they got the money because of all the people responsible for the (huge financial and critical) success, they appear to be the only ones not getting a reasonable share.</p>
<p>Interesting, if I were into playing games: <a href="http://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi">Welcome to NationStates</a></p>
<p>Speaking of games, Arsenal kept their unbeaten season record alive today, though narrowly, with a ni-nil draw to Birmingham; only three matches left and all are easily winnable for the London side. One SoccerNet columnist recently claimed Birmingham's keeper Maik Taylor has been the EPL's best this year and this result certainly lends support for that judgment.</p>
<p>I wonder if my friend Annie went to town for <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/flash7.htm">the big party</a>...</p>
<p>My sister wants me to wear a <a href="http://rogerstuxedos.com/styles-4.htm">silver vest and tie</a> for her wedding, along with a black tuxedo. My style is not nearly so flashy, I prefer a more..umm...understated elegance, but for her, I will quietly go along.</p>
