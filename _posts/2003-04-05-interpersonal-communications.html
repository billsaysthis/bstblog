<p>Jeremy stands up from concealment<br />
<br />and smashes his elbow straight<br />
<br />into the face of another man<br />
<br />walking down the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Blood flies from his nose all<br />
<br />over his charcoal suit and fresh<br />
<br />white dress shirt.</p>
<p>The bloody man is named Thomas,<br />
<br />he looks up as the unknown assailant<br />
<br />rises to his full height and races off<br />
<br />down the crowded lunchtime sidewalk.</p>
<p>Thomas swears once, twice,<br />
<br />puts his hand to his nose and<br />
<br />feels an intense jolt of pain.</p>
<p>Riana sees the strange incident<br />
<br />but averts her head as she<br />
<br />comes alongside Thomas--<br />
<br />thinking that men deserve any<br />
<br />violence they encounter, so fine.</p>
<p>"What happened?" Thomas asks her<br />
<br />but Riana will not turn and answer,<br />
<br />shuddering as he bends over in pain,<br />
<br />blood dripping to the ground.</p>
<p>Another woman runs out from the store<br />
<br />on whose sidewalk this all has happened<br />
<br />and puts her arm around Thomas<br />
<br />while handing him some napkins for his nose;<br />
<br />"Do you need help?" she asks.</p>
