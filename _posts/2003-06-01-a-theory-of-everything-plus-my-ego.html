<p>Thomas Friedman, as usual IMO, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/01/opinion/01FRIE.html">gives real insight</a> into "why everyone hates us" these days, us being Americans. Bottom line is that America is just too powerful and too hard to influence from the outside. At the end he asks readers to send him suggestions: To "manage this situation will be critical to managing America's relations with the rest of the globe. Any ideas? Let's hear 'em: <a href="mailto:thfrie@nytimes.com">thfrie@nytimes.com</a>.</p>
<p>I suffer no shortage of opinions or self-esteem issues that prevent sharing them, so I wrote in:</p>
<p>"Stop the lying. Claiming things that just aren't true in support of extremist positions which are carefully labeled (by the speaker and supporting ancillaries such as Heritage Foundation) as moderate just doesn't help. I'm not claiming there are no instances where secrecy isn't a better choice but out and out lies are just wrong."</p>
<p>Short but to the point. I'm hoping he'll not only quote me but throw in a link to the website because Google just isn't sending the traffic lately.</p>
