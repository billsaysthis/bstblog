<p>Every Summer about this time, the television networks and producing studios put on a tour for television columnists (the folks who write the TV columns and reviews in your local paper). This year, at the encouragement of paper-mate Dan Gillmor, the Mercury News' TV writer has posted his thoughts on Blog*Spot: <a href="http://www.tvwriter.blogspot.com/">Charlie McCollum in Hollywood</a>. Not bad, a little bit more on the parties, operational details, and behind the scenes stuff than on the show news but worth a read. Hasn't been updated since Thursday, so the Tour may be over though that isn't explicitly stated. Interesting tidbits about <em>24</em> at the top.</p>
