<p>Frum and Perle <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/21/opinion/21FRUM.html?ex=1390021200&amp;en=3f64711208b289a0&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">ask an interesting question</a> in a NY Times OpEd piece: What will the Democratic candidates due about the Saudi Problem. Trouble is, Bush hasn't given an answer either; last night's speech was a farce of the highest order, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Pot, meet kettle.</p>
