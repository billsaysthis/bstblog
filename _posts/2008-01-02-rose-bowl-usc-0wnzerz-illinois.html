<p>Still almost seven minutes of the game left as I start this post but seriously, it was over when the Trojans forced a fumble on a goal line stand to end the Illini's second drive of the second half. John David Booty started fast, had trouble as the opposition D adjusted and then rode a fistful of turnovers that completely disheartened Illinois to a huge margin of victory.</p>
<p>They key sequence: After going down 21-0, the Big Ten #2 got a field goal to close out the first half and a TD to open the second, wrapped around a bunch of good defensive stops. They were in the red zone threatening to shave the lead to just four points so the forced fumble recovered for a touchback that was followed by an 80 yard TD drive was like a shot of electricity for USC, not to mention a score of 28-10 instead of 21-17.</p>
<p>Booty finishes his college career with a resounding W (27 of 37 for 255 yards and 3 touchdowns) and seems sure to be a first or second round pick in April. Given the ridiculous series of upsets at the top of the rankings this past season, one can only believe that if JD hadn't broken a finger against Stanford the Trojans would be sitting at #1 in the BCS and playing next Monday for the title.</p>
<p>Chauncey Washington (75 yards and 1 TD rushing, 20 yards and another TD receiving) and Joe McKnight (125 yards and 1 TD rushing, 45 receiving and two decent kickoff returns) were simply hard to stop running or catching the ball, with Stefon Johnson (109 yards) and Herschel Dennis (30 yards, 1 TD and almost a second as time ran out) taking care of backfield business after the game was out of reach.</p>
<p>McKnight had the key play of that backbreaker drive. Booty stood up from the snap and threw it to Joe immediately heading towards the right sideline; McKnight couldn't make the catch--but since it was going backwards, it was technically a lateral and a live ball which he snatched on the bounce and kept running, making 65 yards before Vontae Davis caught up for the tackle. Everyone was groaning and expecting yet another three an out but Joe got the team back on track.</p>
<p>A nod to Fred Davis and Stanley Havili for some great blocking and pass catching.</p>
<p>Ray Maualuga had a whopper of a day at linebacker with three sacks, a bunch of big tackles and constant energy and leadership. He's a junior who was thought likely to declare for the draft but recently committed to return.</p>
<p>The whole defense was awesome but especially Cary Harris with an INT and fumble recovery and Brian Cushing and Kaluka Maiava who forced and recovered that crucial goal line fumble.</p>
<p>Draft Outlook: Davis is the top-rated tight end coming out of college after this season and could go in the late first or early second round, Booty similar and Washington probably going on the second day. The Trojans will also lose D line standouts Sedric Ellis and Lawrence Jackson, both projected first rounders, and O line leader Sam Baker, a potential high pick if he has a good Combine.</p>
<p>And could the Trojans open at the top of the preseason rankings?</p>
