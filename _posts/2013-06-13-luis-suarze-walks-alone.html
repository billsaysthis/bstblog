<p>Continuing to diss the loyal fans who supported him through the eight game suspension for being a racist and 10 games for being a carnivore in public, Luis Suarez continues his public campaign <a href="http://www.fannation.com/truth_and_rumors/view/390571">for Real Madrid to come in for him</a>. But so far the Spaniards are apparently not willing to match Liverpool's required fee.</p>
<p>And new boss Carlo Ancelloti may have a different EPL star in mind though as rumor has Los Blancos <a href="http://www.fannation.com/truth_and_rumors/view/390291">lining up a record transfer fee</a> for the player who beat Suarez out for Player of the Year, Gareth Bale. How much? Let's say £85 million, £5 million more than the team paid for Ronaldo.</p>
<p>But even with Bale on board will Ronaldo stay? So far he hasn't signed a contract extension and so a handful of billionaire-backed clubs are preparing bids with lots of zeros at the end. Man City, PSG, Chelsea all seem interested.</p>
<p>Perhaps most intriguingly there's Monaco. The team, owned by a Russian rival of Chelsea's Abramovich, has already spent £120 million or so on three players but adding CR7 would surely be enough to take them from Ligue 2 to Champions League in one season, and not having to play in European competition this season would make him fresher for the World Cup next summer.</p>
<p>If he leaves Madrid, with Higuan also out the door, Bale would need someone more than Karim Benzima to partner with and then Suarez, even at £40-50 million, looks much better.</p>
<p>Hard to see the terrific LFC fans, supportive as we've been the past two seasons, getting past the poor-mouthing of Luis Suarez the last few weeks.</p>
