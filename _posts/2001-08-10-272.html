<p><b>Bill likes to be read</b><br />

<p>He has an ego, are you surprised? So he read this WebMoinkey article on <a href="http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/01/23/index1a.html">Search Engine optimization</a> by Paul Boutin and decided to add some meta tags (keywords, description, and abstract) to the pages on the website. This was easy to do since most pages rely on single function to generate the HTML header--don't you just love modular coding? The Web Developer's Virtual Library also has a good <a href="http://www.stars.com/Search/Meta/Tag.html">tutorial</a> on the topic, with more detail on all the meta tags. Allegedly, using these tags will help this website show up in more search engine result pages and send more people over.</p>
