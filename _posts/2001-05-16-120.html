<p><b>Jet Li: Getting Real...then unreal</b><br />

<p>Mr. Showbiz has an update on martial arts star <a href="http://www.jetli.com/main.php" title="Kiss of Death trailer here">Jet Li</a> from Cannes. Now that even Drew Barrymore can do the acrobat crap, what's Li's advantage? <a href="http://mrshowbiz.go.com/news/2001/5/jetlicannes051501.html">Jet Li Knows Kung Fu--and You Don't</a>. His next flick, Kiss of the Dragon, written and directed by <a href="http://www.luc-besson.com/" title="Besson's official site is in French">Luc Besson (</a><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Besson,+Luc" title="at least IMDB is in English">La Femme Nikita, The Professional</a>) and due out in July, is a back to basics, no invisible wire, street fighting blast.</p>
<p>After that, he has a science fiction thriller due at Thanksgiving called <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0267804">The One</a>, which has lots of computer effects and wire work. This movie, written by X-Files vets James Wong and Glen Morgan, is the first major movie to use the multiverse concept, with Li as a cop who finds a way to travel between universes to kill the alternate versions of himself. Interestingly, wrestler/Scorpion King The Rock was originally going to star in this one.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/213.web.stuff/Jared%20Mixon/page3" title="the only decent scientific explanation I could find easily">multiverse concept</a>, in short, says that the universe we see/exist in is not the only one but is one of many, each of which differs minutely from its immediate neighbors (think of very thin slices of a block) and more are constantly being created each time a decision point/choice is breached. While this is the first major film to exploit the concept, it has been used widely in SF novels and comics. Multiverse is also the name of a popular roleplaying game.</p>
