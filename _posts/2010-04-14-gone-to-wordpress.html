<p>For more than nine years, beginning with <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/blog/2001/03/stones-into-sopranos/">Stones to be rolled into Sopranos</a> and continuing for over 4,000 more posts, I've been an active user and frequent evangelist for Google's Blogger. Heck, my use predates Google's acquisition of Blogger by quite a margin. But today I cut over the new version of BillSaysThis and it uses <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>.</p>
<p>I wasn't looking to make this switch and I'm not happy at having to do it. But Google has forced my hand. The company has never put all that much in the way of resources to the Blogger team, as best I can tell from the outside, but as they'll be removing a key feature, one on which I've always depended, on May 1 I have no choice.</p>
<p>The feature is Publish via FTP. That means after you click the Publish button on the Blogger post writing page, any new or changed pages are generated and transferred to a remote host. This feature allowed us to use Blogger but host the blog on our own sites. The published reasoning for the change is that the feature takes too much effort given how few blogs use it but this seems to be putting the best face they could think of on it rather than the real reason.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, WordPress 3.0 is out as a beta and works well enough to use already. WordPress has a decent import tool so, with a bit help from my friend/inside connection <a href="http://dentedreality.com.au">Beau</a>, I was able to get all the posts into the new system. Color advice from <a href="http://dangerousmeta.com">Garret</a> helped too.</p>
<p>One of the best new features in 3.0 that made this a much easier choice and solution is support for multiple blogs from one install of WordPress. Previously you had to install separate copies for each blog and do maintenance, plugin installs, design and so on separately for each. I already had two WP 2.x blogs, <a href="/politics">bill:politics</a> and <a href="/movies">Bill's Movie Reviews</a>, so I created new blogs for each in the 3.0 install and with a few clicks imported the old content.</p>
<p>Some of my old pages depend on custom PHP code and so either will take a bit more time to port or stay in the old format. C'est la vie.</p>
<p>Looking forward to nine years (at least) with WordPress.</p>
<p>And, oh yeah, one last thing: Comments are open, at least for newer posts.</p>
