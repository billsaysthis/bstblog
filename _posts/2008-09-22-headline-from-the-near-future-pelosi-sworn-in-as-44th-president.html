<p>(Washington, D.C., 21 Jan 09) Nancy Pelosi (D, California) was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7626471.stm">sworn in as this nation's first female President</a> by Chief Justice John G. Roberts on the steps of the US Capital building this morning after neither the House nor Senate were able to resolve last November's Electoral College tie between Barack Obama and John McCain.</p>
<p>"The people of America must be able to rely on their elected representatives to fulfill the responsibilities set out in the Constitution of the United States. I will serve as President until such time as Congress settles this great question, guided by the results of the popular vote, the advice of my Cabinet nominees and in consultation with the two candidates. As already announced my Cabinet will by drawn from the ranks of qualified women and men of both parties.</p>
<p>"However, unless informed otherwise by relevant legal authorities, I intend to retain my vote in role calls and the Presidental resolution as a member of the California delegation in the House of Representatives and to return to the Speaker's office once the House finds a majority will."</p>
<p>Under the Constitution, a new President must be inaugurated by January 20 and as Speaker of the House of Representatives Pelosi was next in line for the top job. This unprecedented event came after both candidates won 269 Electoral College votes in the Nov. 4 balloting, throwing the race into the hands of Congress. Senator Obama won the popular vote by a nearly 2,000,000 vote margin.</p>
<p>The House is required to elect the new President but with conservative Democrats throwing support to McCain neither party could muster the 26 state block votes to win the post. The Senate was caught up by parliamentary procedures that enabled several senators to block Democratic VP Joseph Biden despite his party's nearly 10 seat majority.</p>
<p>While both houses are expected to eventually make permanent selections, statements in recent days from Roberts clearly made today's dramatic interim outcome necessary. Obama and McCain separately told reporters they accepted Pelosi's elevation as important for an orderly transition from the Bush Administration but expect her's to be among the shortest of Presidential tenures.</p>
<p>"America must have a Commander-in-Chief sitting in the Oval Office and through the wisdom of our Founding Fathers the answer to this crisis is simple," said Senator McCain at the National Press Club this afternoon. "I thank President Pelosi for her prompt agreement to step in and expect the Congress to immediately put aside party politics and elect a new President and Vice President as their duty and the people of this great country require."</p>
<p>Legislators have only had two weeks to decide this issue since the new Congress was sworn in just after the new year. The House of Representatives appear closer to breaking the deadlock, with rumors and unattributed news reports claiming that either Nevada or Rhode Island will switch from the Republican to Democratic columns within days.</p>
<p>"America's Constitution has once again demonstrated its greatness and the foresight of its authors by providing for the difficult situation in which we find ourselves," Senator Obama said on CNN this afternoon. "President Pelosi has my full support and confidence and I will work with her to ensure the nation moves forward without respite to deal with the huge economic and security problems left to us by President Bush."</p>
<p>The Senate needs at least several days to perhaps a week to clear away several procedural matters presented by Republican senators from Wyoming, Alabama and Texas but once done Senator Biden should become Vice President with at least 53 votes. If this happens before the House completes work, he would immediately become acting President.</p>
<p>Should neither house be able to get a majority result, President Pelosi will remain in office until the 2012 elections. She can stand for the office in that race but under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">22nd Amendment</a> having served more than two years in the current term would not be eligible to run again 2016.</p>
