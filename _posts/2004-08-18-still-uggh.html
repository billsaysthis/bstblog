<p>Let's just say that yesterday's issue is still an issue. I'd reported it to Google Support and got a fairly useless response--the problem ticket generator form allows you to select whether the problem applies to one blog or none in particular and since this problem happens to me across blogs I selected the latter and the email I got simply asked which blog had the problem. And I sent my reply at lunch time but of course didn't hear back before quiting time. Now that's well-trained support, right?<br /></p>
