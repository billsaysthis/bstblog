<p><b>Where are the Chinese taking us?</b>
<p>Even though the <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/default-200144225218.htm">crew scurried to destroy data of 'crown jewel'</a> on the US spyplane that emergency landed in China, the Chinese may have advanced their tech several years by stripping the plane. Of course, that act and holding the crewmembers hostage violates several international treaties that both China and the US have signed.</p>
<p>Let's face it, wars have started over less. Now, <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,3-109461,00.html">China may put the plane's crew on trial for espionage</a>, something the US (and certainly the Bush administration rightwingers) cannot allow.</p>
