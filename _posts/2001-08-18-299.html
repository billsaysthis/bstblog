<p><b>Lies, Damn Lies, and Lobbyists</b><br />

<p>Lobbyists are people who are paid to espouse a point of view and to convince others that their position is the correct one. In <a href="http://glennf.com/blog/2001/08/13.html">Palm Power</a>, Glenn Fleishman writes about the successful work being done by a coal industry organization. Their position is that (a) we need more power generated to support the demand imposed by Palm Pilots [sic] plus other modern devices and (b) the best way to generate that power is by burning coal. This group is using ridiculous arithmatic but even as reputable an outlet as the New York Times is <a href="http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/news/aboutStory/about6_1_01.html">buying into it</a> even when scientists provide contrary evidence. Urggh and a half!</p>
