<p>Let's see, so far we have card stock for the invitations, a wonderful friend to perform the ceremony, a promise from my family to be here, and a possible date (in June). We have a best man and a maid of honor. Looking for a beautiful place to have our small yet elegant affair is next on the to do list. How about <a href="http://www.hakone.com">Hakone Gardens</a> in Saratoga, <a href="http://www.hornblower.com">Hornblower Cruises</a> in San Francisco (actually in San Francisco Bay) or the <a href="http://www.hoteldeanza.com/">Hotel DeAnza</a> in San Jose?</p>
<p>I will even break down and buy a brand new suit since I don't own even one any more, though I really dislike wearing them--that's one of the great things about working and living out in Silicon Valley. Something dark and tasteful, of course, with a nice red stripe tie. Vivian is gown shopping a week from Saturday. Flowers and a photographer, hmm. She's in the bedroom now, talking long distance to the maid of honor about all the details.</p>
<p>These and more must be investigated, planned, and put in place. The Sweet One is excited and anxious but I'm confident we can do this and do it well, have an amazing special day. And then spend the rest of our lives loving each other as much--or more--than we do today. Looby, hunnay!</p>
