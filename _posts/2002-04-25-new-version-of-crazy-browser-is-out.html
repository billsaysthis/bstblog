<p>To see what our benefactor has added, check <a href="http://www.crazybrowser.com/whatsnew.htm">Crazy Browser - What's New</a> or just save the time and go to <a href="http://www.crazybrowser.com/download.htm">the Download page</a> and get it. I have used this excellent Internet Explorer add-on since I became aware of it. Many good features not the least of which is the low, low price of FREE!</p>
