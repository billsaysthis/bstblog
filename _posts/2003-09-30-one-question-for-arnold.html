<p>This came to mind only yesterday, so perhaps I cannot fault the journalists and pundits who are following Issa's folly, but there's still a week left and I'd love to see someone ask Mr. Muscles this--of course he wouldn't give a meaningful answer, he rarely does. Even just putting this thought into the minds of the electorate may be useful, which is good enough. If Davis is recalled and he is elected, Schwartzenegger will have to work with overwhelming majorities in both houses of the California legislature. How, I'd like to know, does he expect to get any bills on his desk for signature that haven't been formulated to be amenable to all those Democrats?</p>
<p>Are there any journalists willing to stick a microphone in Ah-nuld's face and ask him this one little question?</p>
