<p><a href="http://www.etext.org/Politics/MIM/bookstore/index.html#M">Music reviews</a> from the Maoist International Movement, including <a href="http://www.etext.org/Politics/MIM/bookstore/music/metal/zep4.html">Led Zeppelin IV</a> and <a href="http://www.etext.org/Politics/MIM/bookstore/music/hiphop/fiftycent.html" title="If the title of 50 Cent's latest album, 'Get Rich or Die Tryin', doubles as his mission statement, it would be in the interest of social progress if he reached the latter fate. While this may seem a strong statement, it's nowhere near as strong as the evidence the 50 Cent's thinking contained on this album is as backward as humynly possible.">50 Cent</a>. You'd think they'd given Aussie rockers Midnight Oil a break but apparently Peter Garrett's politics <a href="http://www.etext.org/Politics/MIM/bookstore/music/alternative/midnightoil.html">aren't far left enough</a>.</p>
