<p>Bill O'Reilly is pathetic, which I'm sure you know, but Jim Gilliam provides <a href="http://www.jimgilliam.com/2004/08/bill_oreilly_protesters_terrorists.php">a clip from today's show</a> that demonstrates this so clearly its worth saying again. Bill, buddy, old pal, are you so afraid of terrorists that you would give up your right to protest? What if the tables were turned, the Democrats were running the show and you wanted to make some noise? That'd be different because, well, you're just always in the right, right?<br /></p>
