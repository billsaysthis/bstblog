<p>She wants to hold my hand, Daddy!<br />
<br />What do you want son?<br />
<br />What should I do, she wants to hold my hand!<br />
<br />What does your heart say, son?<br />
<br />She watches me across from the playground!<br />
<br />What does she see, son?<br />
<br />She passes me notes in class.<br />
<br />What does she write, son?<br />
<br />She whispers in my ear as we pass in the hall!<br />
<br />What does she tell you, son?<br />
<br />She giggles at me every morning on the bus.<br />
<br />What makes her laugh, son?<br />
<br />I KISSED HER DAD!</p>
