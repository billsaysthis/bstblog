<p>Finding ourselves free this afternoon, we took advantage of the matinee prices to see the latest big screen version of Alexander Dumas' <a href="http://bventertainment.go.com/movies/montecristo/count.htm">The Count of Monte Cristo</a>; IMDB lists at least six previous films with this title. Jim Caviezel, Guy Pearce, and <a href="http://www.canoe.ca/JamMoviesArtistsD/dominczyk_dagmara.html">Dagmara Dominczyk</a> (new hottie alert) are all strong in one of the oldest love triangles in literature. I also liked Michael Wincott as the warden Dorleac, he reminded me of a Michael Des Barre who could actually act, and Richard Harris as Dantes' prison mentor. Jay Wolpert  (screenplay) and Kevin Reynolds (direction) give us a nicely paced, visually attractive film with Reynolds definitely moving up in class after previously specializing in Kevin Costner bombs--Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and especially Waterworld. <em>Recommended</em></p>
