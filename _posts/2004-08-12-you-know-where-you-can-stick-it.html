<p>The <a href="http://www.sfgiants.com">Giants</a> suck. No doubt I hate baseball but tonight is even worse because the Giants game has gone into extra innings and pre-empting/delaying the (already tape-delayed) <a href="http://www.sjearthquakes.com">Earthquakes</a>-Fire broadcast. Both sides may currently be in last place in thier respective divisions but are still strong squads that match up well against each other and I was really looking forward to watching. Making it worse, FSN hasn't even bothered to have the announcers say anything or to run a crawl on the bottom of the screen telling us whether they'll join in progress.</p>
<p>As I wrote the last sentence, the Pirates hit a home run to <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/boxscore?gid=240811123">win the game</a>. 7:24. How long will it be before the soccer is onscreen? Oh sure, let's show some commercials (five) first, then back to the <del>idiots</del>announcers.</p>
<p>Looks like the entire match will be broadcast, at least, given that their opening with a normal pre-game run up.</p>
<p><em>Later:</em> We lost 2-1 when we should have won 3-1 or better. Landon hit the crossbar, Mullan hit the left post, the ref gave us one PK but completely missed a second (not to mention giving out cards like they were bites of chocolate). Mostly, even with a man advantage for the last 50 minutes, the Quakes just never got it together tonight. I would also question Coach Kinnear's decision to put Donovan on in place of Derosario to start the second half; I would have put Donovan on, for sure, but in place of Waibel and gone with a 3-5-2. Damn, with both Dallas and Colorado also losing tonight we blew a good shot to climb back into third and instead remain in the cellar.<br /></p>
