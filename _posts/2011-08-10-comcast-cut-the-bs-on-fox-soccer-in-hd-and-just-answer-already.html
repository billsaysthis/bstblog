<p>[This is the email I sent to Comcast, for all the good it will do.]</p>
<p>I'm getting fed up with the BS line the customer service people are told to give as an answer when I call to ask why I have to pay extra for Fox Soccer Channel and GolTV.</p>
<p>I was told, after waiting ONE FREAKING YEAR since my last call, the same BS: that Comcast cannot carry these channels in HD because the networks won't allow it.</p>
<p>Fox, of course, says that they'd be happy to have the ONE OF THE TWO LARGEST CABLE COMPANIES IN AMERICA carrying their network.</p>
<p>Clearly one company is not telling the truth. Given that Fox can only gain from carriage the logical answer is that Comcast is not being honest.</p>
<p>What, is $250 a month for TV and Internet not enough to be at least treated with respect???</p>
<p>As it happens last summer I spoke with a manager after getting the standard BS line and he told me that Comcast was planning a network upgrade that would increase HD capacity but it wouldn't be ready until about June of this year. Well, its August and I see I can get WGN and KCSM in HD but still no Fox Soccer Channel.</p>
<p>Why is Comcast not willing to answer honestly and openly? Look at the hottest thread on the customer forums, http://forums.comcast.com/t5/Channels-and-Programming/FSC-HD-Fox-Soccer-Channel/td-p/756830, over 400 posts from customers begging or telling of switching to a different provider and yet all Comcast Larry can say is he has brought the request to the team's attention.</p>
<p>Answer already!</p>
