<p>I didn't label this blog as Getting My Crank On for nothing, people. These jizzbots at ATT (the TV group this time, not the Internet access side) call me up to schedule an appointment to determine if my set-top boxes are subject to a manufacturer recall. They will come, or so they told me last Monday, between 10 a.m. and noon today. How surprised are you to read that they never showed?</p>
<p>Even better, when I called to see what was up their butt, I was told that the work order never got into the system. So the field tech never had my place on his stop list for today. "We're so sorry. But there's nothing we can offer beyond that apology. Not even credit for your time," said the ATT customer service rep. "When can I reschedule the appointment for?" he asked, revealing a shocking deficit in his understanding of proper English grammar as well.</p>
<p>I so wish there was a reasonable alternative to ATT service that was likely to be both better and still in business in, say, two years. This is far from my first post on these low wattage lightbulbs. <em>Uggh!</em></p>
