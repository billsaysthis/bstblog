<p>I was hoping, really hoping, that I would find something positive to write next in this blog, on any topic. Maybe funny, perhaps uplifting, even pleasantly pornographic. Instead, I am left with the following letter to the editor to the Mercury News:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/opinion/7880665.htm">Alma Taylor wrote</a> in today's letters section that <em>"Putting weapons of mass destruction aside, is there anyone naive enough to think that, if Saddam Hussein had not been removed from power, Libya and Iran would have come forward and revealed their weapons of mass destruction programs?"</em></p>
<p>Her statement, however, is a typical straw man argument that completely misses the key problem many Americans now have with the Bush Administration. My problem, echoed by many others with whom I've spoken, is that President Bush, cabinet members and others in positions of leadership in our nation lied to us. On many occasions one of them stood up in front of an audience and claimed that we needed to go to war in Iraq, NOW, because Hussein had significant quantities of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>If we cannot trust our President, Vice President, Secretaries of State and Defense, and so on down the list to tell us the truth in such a significant situation, when over 500 Americans and thousands of Iraqis have died as part of this war, how can we trust them to tell the truth on any subject?</p>
