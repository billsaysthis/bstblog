<p>The NY Times previews the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/17/movies/17SEQU.html">Summer of the Spinoff</a>, a look at the movies coming this summer and beyond, and asks if the corporate finance managers have taken control of Hollywood. The article points out that there will be no less than 16 movies released between now and the end of this summer that are part of a series, a spinoff from a cartoon or TV show, or a remake of an older hit. Not to mention the tie-ins from the movies to books, TV shows, and other entertainments.</p>
<p>Friday starts us off with The Scorpion King, a prequel to the Mummy movies, which stars the WWF's The Rock and will be accompanied by a History Channel documentary. May gets us the next Star Wars movie, which will have several TV shows built around it, and already has a group of fanatics sleeping out on the sidewalk waiting to see the first showing (of course they have a web page, though I can't find it just now) plus Spider-Man. In June that loony Crocodile Hunter moves to the big screen and Adam Sandler remakes the Frank Capra/Jimmy Stewart classic Mr. Deeds Goes to Washington, Austin Powers in Goldmember bows in July--yes, they made a deal with the Bond people and will show a trailer for December's Die Another Day--along with Men in Black II, and Spy Kids 2 follows in early August.</p>
<p>For years some people have argued that all these sequels, prequels, remakes, and TV shows and cartoons come to big screen lay bare the inability of the Hollywood studios to bring real, meaningful creativity to us. Bull doodoo, okay? For starters, independent and foreign art house films have never been as strong as they are today. Century Theaters, one of the bigger and smarter movie theater chains at least in the Bay Area, has created a new brand (CineArts) of theaters to show these films. Not to mention upcoming studio films like Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood and Salton Sea, both strong dramas with big name casts and backing.</p>
<p>I think with a couple of exceptions (*cough, Scorpion King, Spy Kids, cough*) I'll probably see most of the movies I listed above. Sure these are commercial films, no question about it! And some will probably fall through the cracks, what with more films than ever coming out. But I laughed my ass off through the first two Austin Power movies, loved most of Will Smith's films (even Enemy of the State), same goes for Sandler, and think Spider-Man will be terrific based n the trailers. Don't even go there for Star Wars and the big four coming in November and December: Harry Potter, James Bond, Star Trek: Nemesis, and Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. For the $9.00 and up per ticket I have to pay today, Hollywood will need to earn my business. They seem to keep on doing just that.</p>
