<p>[The following was as vivid to me as if I'd actually done it] I was climbing up cold, snow-covered mountain with three close friends, two men and a woman, none of whom I recognized. And I've never been mountain climbing, especially in winter weather, but thanks to the movies I knew what I was doing, and we must have been about two thousand feet up, maybe half way to the peak. Out of nowhere, wee saw another group of climbers a few hundred feet away. None of us knew there was another climbing party that day, seemed to be three young guys through binoculars, so we waved to them.</p>
<p>Instead of waving back, the other group took out rifles and started shooting at us! My friends and I immediately started moving down, kind of sliding (it was a dream, okay?) and none of us were hit. The shooters started moving down too, same as us, occasionally sending lead our way, and angling closer towards us. We, of course, did not have guns or anything similar, and focused on getting down the mountain as fast as we could. All of a sudden, maybe 100 feet off the ground, the two of the three shooters hit an outcropping of some sort and lost their grip; they got pushed out into the air, essentially, and plunged to the ground. The third guy was able to stay on the mountainside but then, just before reaching the bottom, he slipped and broke his neck as he hit the ground. Somehow, all four of us made it down safely.</p>
<p>We ran over to where our attackers had fallen and found them all dead. Without touching a thing, one of the guys ran for a phone to call the cops. When they showed up, we had another surprise. Keep in mind this is a small town in the middle of nowhere. The sheriff was the father of one of the three attackers, all three of the attackers were teenagers, and he was mighty pissed at us. I tried to explain to him what happeneed but he was so caught up in his grief he wouldn't listen. The sheriff kept taking his gun out of the holster and putting it back, sometimes just opening the restraining strap and closing it. Finally one of his deputies came over and took the gun away from him quietly, friendly, with one arm around the sheriff's shoulders, their two heads touching, whispering, and the sheriff didn't object.</p>
