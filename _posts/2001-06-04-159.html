<p><b>Today's book: The Postman</b><br />

<p>Before there was a <a href="http://www.thepostman.com/">Kevin Costner movie</a> that bombed, there was a novel, a good one, by <a href="http://www.kithrup.com/brin/">David Brin</a>. Now Brin has a better <a href="http://www.kithrup.com/brin/movie.htm">opinion of the movie</a> than many others, but I like the novel much better.</p>
<p>Anyway, the story is set in northwest America 16 years after a 2002 nuclear holocaust. Most people are dead, not only from the bombs and radioactivity but also from fear and distrust of each other, spurred by survivalists who shoot on site. Gordon, our lead character, has been stumbling west for years looking a for a community where American ideals are still alive. One day, he comes across a long dead, well preserved postman and, needing a warm coat, takes the corpse's leather beauty and some mailbags as well, having just lost his wordly posessions in an ambush. Coming to a small village, he begins to act his costume's role. From there, he becomes the hero he seeks and brings about the community he yearns for. Don't think I've spoiled the read for you, as I haven't come close to that. Highly recommended.</p>
<p><i>Bonus reading:</i> Brin has also wrote a very interesting pair of articles for Salon plus a follow up on the <a href="http://www.kithrup.com/brin/starwars.html">elitist, anti-democratic agenda of Star Wars</a>. He makes points that went right past many even though I've watched the movies many times.</p>
