<p>While I was composing the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_06_15_blog_archive.phtml#105605904812239529">previous post</a>, my blog got moved to the <a href="http://new.blogger.com">new system</a>. Which gave me a scare for a moment because when I tried to store the post into Blogger's database, I got a database error; fortunately my practice of clicking CTRL+A, CTRL+C before clicking the Post button once again saved my efforts from oblivion. You should see no difference on the published page, which is kind of unfortunate because that means the new system doesn't include either of the major new features for which I was hoping: <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/">trackback</a> and comments. <em>Oh well.</em></p>
