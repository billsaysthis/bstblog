<p>After winning the iPod (which has been great to have for the gym) I had a number of conversations with Steve Larsen, Mel Badgett and many others at <a href="http://krugle.com">Krugle</a>, who I think have a really solid team. One of the questions I asked them was, since this was around the time that Google Code Hosting debuted, what if the Big G steps into this space as an expansion of that project?</p>
<p>Their feeling, which was based on experience as well as conversations with staff at Google (and other big search engines), was that this niche is too small to be interesting. <a href="http://www.google.com/codesearch">Except that it isn't</a>: <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3636081">Google Launches Code Search</a>. From the linked article:<br />
<blockquote>"The two ways that source code lives on the Internet is in archives, things like Zip files, gzip, etc. And then in software-control repositories like SourceForge.net, <a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/">Google's code hosting</a>, and other places," Google product manager Tom Stocky told <em>internetnews.com</em>. "We'll be crawling all of that."</p></blockquote>
<p>I sure hope this isn't as big a disruption as it looks like for the Kruglers and similarly-focused startup <a href="http://koders.com">Koders</a>. Ken Krugler writes a <a href="http://blog.krugle.com/?p=182">pretty positive response</a> on their blog.</p>
