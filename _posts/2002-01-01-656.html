<p><strong>Lord of the Rings: Fan fiction</strong></p>
<p>Fan fiction has been around for a long time, mostly inspired by science fiction series like Star Trek and Star Wars, but others have taken the Lord of the Rings as their source. <a href="http://www.amazonsystems.co.uk/pony/pp.htm">Tales from the Prancing Pony</a> is one such story, allegedly recounting the 1886 vacation in Middle Earth by three English civil servants and includes photographs and other illustration. Gil Williamson wrote it in 1998 and posted it to the web the next year. Interesting effort but not having quite the appeal of the original as there is little drama in this travelogue.</p>
