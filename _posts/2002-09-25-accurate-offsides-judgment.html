<p>One of the weakest points in soccer, and most disputed by teams and fans, is the offsides call. Particularly when the referee's assistant who makes the call is not in good enough shape and consequently is a dozen yards upfield when raising his flag. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/sports/AP-SOC-Offsides-Computer.html">Germans Invent Offsides Computer</a> reports that the Cairos System, developed by the Frauenhofer Institute in Erlangen and Munich's Technical University, should be available for sale next Fall. The $245,000 system uses small sensors inside the ball and the players' shin guards to feed a piece of software that runs real time analysis; it will also tell the referee if the defender wall on a free kick is set back the minimum required distance.</p>
<p><em>Way cool!</em></p>
