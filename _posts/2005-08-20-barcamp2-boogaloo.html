<p>We're in a bit of a lull here. Microformats is the next session at 11, a joint presentation with Tantek Celik up at Foo Camp; wonder how they're gonna do that, possibly through <a href="http://macromedia.breezecentral.com/">BreezeCentral</a>. Wireless security is apparently a joke, which Jake Appelbaum demonstrated a few moments ago. I'm trying out Jiwire's <a href="http://www.jiwire.com/spotlock.htm">SpotLock</a> to see if I can improve LittleSteven's profile.</p>
<p>A few people from <a href="http://www.flock.com/">Flock</a> are here and promise a big demo tomorrow. I did get a bit of a scoop from <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog">Chris Messina</a>, if you can call it that, which is that Flock is a distribution of Firefox in the same way that <a href="http://www.knoppix.de/">Knoppix</a> is a distribution of Linux. <a href="http://www.siliconbeat.com/entries/2005/08/19/flock_and_wordpresscom_nifty_tools.html">Could be pretty cool</a>--Andy Smith is using it on the projector though not technically demoing it.</p>
<p>Very hot in here. Not in the Nelly sense. My contacts aren't handling it well.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">11:30:</span> I took the contacts out, it was just too much for me. I'm sitting with <a href="http://www.slashchick.com/">Erica Douglass</a>, CEO of <a href="http://www.simpli.biz/">Simpli Hosting</a> and also ex-Sun, listening to <a href="http://theryanking.com/blog/">the Ryan King</a> and <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/">Kevin Marks</a> cover the history, architecture and practicalness of microformats (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/niallkennedy/35526311/">photo of Kevin and Ryan</a>). Robert, Erica has a TabletPC too, a Toshiba!</p>
