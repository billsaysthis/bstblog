<p><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Corman,%20Roger">Roger Corman</a> made many forgettable movies. Many. But some were worth watching and 1979's <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Credits?0079813#directors">Rock 'n' Roll High School</a> was surely one of them. Corman films never have any budget to speak of but in <em>RRHS</em> he got a terrific mix of the Ramones (the concert scene has four of their songs alone), PJ Soles, Clint Howard, Mary Woronov and Paul Bartel in a 20 years behind the times story. By the late '70s, adults were no longer trying to ban rock music but that doesn't matter to the three directors and six writers who put this farce together.</p>
<p>Bartel and Woronov are most notable for the indie classic <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0083869">Eating Raoul</a>. The Ramones, of course, went on to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Howard appears in many of his brother's films, and Soles never got the stardom she deserved, though she has been happily married since 1984.</p>
<p><em>Recommended</em></p>
<p>Ice Cube and Mike Epps make an attempt to step up in class in last year's <a href="http://www.benjaminsmovie.com/">All About The Benjamins</a>. An action/comedy about a bounty hunter (Cube) hooking up with a small time con man (Epps) who get in the middle of a $20 million diamond heist while trying to retrieve the winning ticket for a $60 million lottery. Other than the fact that the leads here are Black, I don't see how the movie is any better than your standard Brian Bosworth/Julie Strain straight to video effort. And with Strain at least viewers get to ogle her awesome body.</p>
<p><em>Not worth the 90 minutes</em></p>
