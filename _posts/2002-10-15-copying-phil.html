<p>Face it, a lot of the web is all about copying. Copy somebody's images, some page's styles or look, copy somebody else's music. No worries, that's the way it's done.</p>
<p>One of my favorite guys to to play Follow the Leader with is <a href="http://philringnalda.com/archives/002348.php">Phil "I live in the middle of nowhere" Ringnalda</a>. I first encountered him in the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/bloggerpro2">Blogger mailing lists</a> where he has helped me and many, many others. So when he does something smart, like use Morten Frederiksen's <a href="http://purl.org/net/syndication/subscribe/">Syndication Subscription Service</a>, I don't hesitate, I just do it. Okay, he did switch to Movable Type, which I've pondered, but that's just too huge a change for me and unnecessary, but this one is good.</p>
<p>Frederiksen's service simplifies the current jumble of formats and tools used for publishing and reading RSS feeds. RSS is, arguably, Really Simple Syndication according to one of it's primary developers, Dave Winer, so I'll go along with that. If you are into RSS, then you can get mine by clicking the green SUB button at the top of this column.</p>
<p>Thanks again, Phil.</p>
