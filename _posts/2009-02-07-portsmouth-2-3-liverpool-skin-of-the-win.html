<p>Liverpool have played a lot of games, six in two and a half weeks, and Steven Gerrard is out for the next three weeks on injury so Rafa Benitez decided to give some younger players a chance to show value today against relegation zone Portsmouth. He also switched formations to three at the back, an interesting choice, though in the end I don't think it hurt us.</p>
<p>No, what hurt us was the inability of Ryan Babel and David Ngog to combine effectively in the final third. Babel has been looking especially week of late and today was little different as he muffed an absolute sitter that went past David James in the 61st minute.</p>
<p>Benitez was forced to bring on Dirk Kuyt, Xabi Alonso and finally El Nino, Fernando Torres and the trio were able to get the necessary second and third goals for the three points. Torres got the winner in the 91st on a header which was a virtual carbon copy of the winner he scored last Sunday against Chelsea.</p>
<p>The win puts us back at the top of the Premier League, at least until Manchester United play West Ham tomorrow and make up their missed game with Fulham on the 18th. Liverpool are off for two weeks for the international break and the FA Cup fifth round, the latter due to a heartbreaking goal from an Everton debutant near the end of extra time. One less trophy possibility but perhaps not too terrible since that means fewer games for a lean squad.</p>
<p>Chelsea, by the way, are spiraling out of control. They couldn't manage a goal today against Hull City, though Cech and Terry saved the point for them. With Aston Villa posting a strong win, the Blues dropped to fourth--six points ahead of Arsenal but the Gunners don't play until tomorrow and could have that against a staggering Tottenham.</p>
<p>If the last two league games are a real trend, the Reds fortunes are looking up. The boys are fighting hard until the very end and always going for all three points. Sweet!</p>
