<p>In general I believe the entertainment companies are going too far in their war to prevent piracy, hence the BST homepage links to Stop the CBDTPA and Stop Policeware. But in <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hollywoodreporter/music/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1455550">specific cases</a>, though, I'm <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hollywoodreporter/music/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1449721">all for it</a>. The Hollywood Reporter says that Celine Dion's new CD will <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hollywoodreporter/music/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1456095">crash PCs and Macs</a> it is played on due to the use of Key2Audio copy protection in Germany and several other European countries. Hey, this is Celine Dion! As far as I'm concerned, the CD ought to crash any machine it is played on anywhere in the world. Then I would never hear it.</p>
