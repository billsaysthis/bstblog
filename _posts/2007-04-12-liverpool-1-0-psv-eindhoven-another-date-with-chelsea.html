<p>PSV must have decided before the opening whistle blew that they were never going to climb last week's three goal hill visiting Anfield, or at least that's the way they played. The Reds weren't a whole lot more enthusiastic, with Craig Bellamy going off early with minor knee trouble lowering the motivation on the home side, but Peter Crouch was determined to keep his goal streak going and did.</p>
<p>Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler came on for Bellamy in the 17th minute and Fowler made the goal by getting the rebound off Crouch's first shot and passing it back to the beanpole. The 68th minute goal was about the only serious attempt by either side. Rafa Benitez, looking at an overloaded schedule over the next month, rested Stephen Gerrard, Jamie Carragher, Dirk Kuyt, Steve Finnan and Javer Mascherano and PSV boss Ronald Koemann had his own injury woes limiting his choices.</p>
<p>Chelsea scored an injury time winner last night to beat Valencia 1-2, coming back from an early 1-0 deficit, and so for the third straight season Liverpool will meet Roman Abramovich's team in a cup quarterfinal. We've won the last two and I would be thrilled to see the boys make it three, though with Michael Essien and Joe Cole coming back from injury and Andre Schevchenko and Shaun Wright-Phillips getting in good form this is no easy task.</p>
<p>No matter. The Reds' comebacks against Milan in the 2005 Champions League final and West Ham in last season's FA Cup final show they're a team that wants to win every time out.</p>
