<p><b>Sun admits it screwed up with NetDynamics</b></p>
<p>In a recent government filing, Sun Microsystems admitted <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-7383790.html">acquisition misfires</a> in purchasing NetDynamics, Diba, and even Encore. Duh! I think I could have told you that two years ago. We are still wondering why Sun bought us, then turned around and made the iPlanet deal with AOL, and then took a year to figure things out. Oh, it was not a stressful time at all, no! And the executives did not screw the pooch by taking so long and changing their minds 67 times. No! They did not fiddle while BEA burned us in the marketplace. At least the execs are starting to admit some culpability, to the tune of a $33 million writeoff.</p>
