<p>I called Apple Support this morning. The guy I spoke with was very considerate and friendly, nonetheless we still went 0 for 3 and I didn't even mention the fourth item. For each one the support rep said he simply had no answer but put support incidents into the system to create a record and get me an answer down the line if new information comes out:
<ol>
<li>After listening to music for a few hours the phone simply shut off. On first try even the holding down the combination of the power and sleep/wake buttons had no effect. After 10 minutes I tried it again and the phone powered up.</li>
<li>Events created on the phone's calendar app are not pushed back to iCal on my MacBook.</li>
<li>For a POP3 email account--the server doesn't have IMAP--I want to create a new folder on the phone for archives. Currently this does not seem to be possible.</li>
<li>After any one of a number of events, the music player loses its place in a playlist and further, there is no way I can see to choose the first song for shuffle mode play even though iTunes on OS X has this capability. (This is the one I didn't mention to the rep.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Lazy/Intarweb, can you help?</p>
