<p>When you've lost the capacity to be surprised by how self-centered and self-serving corporate chieftains can be. Dan Gillmor posted <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/000953.shtml">American Airlines' Betrayal of Trust</a> to his blog today and after reading it I just thought, so what? I mean, the choices made by American's executives and board are disappointing and sad but after the last couple of years, I just can't get the old indignation up for it any more. Thank goodness for the Sweet One and sports, eh?</p>
