<p>Welcome to the wonderful world of personal publishing, Miss Muller! <a href="http://nosenseworrying.com/">NoSenseWorrying</a> is a new blog from Yankee fanatic/season ticketholder, fellow SpoFite and <a href="http://www.spreadshirt.com/shop.php?sid=4792" title="She designed these shirts and promises more variations">design goddess</a> Jennifer Muller. Goddam, as <a href="http://www.sportsfilter.com/user.cfm/721">we call her</a> on the 'Fi, also helped with some advice on the still in progress redesign of this site.</p>
