<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Stanley_Robinson" title="Kim Stanley Robinson">Kim Stanley Robinson</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Years_of_Rice_and_Salt">The Years of Rice and Salt</a> is alternate history science fiction novel but different from the typical Harry Turtledove/Eric Flint books. While the normal changed event is something in America's (or at least Europe's) past Robinson bases his story on the idea that the Black Death kills 99+% of the people in Europe. In reality the plague, which originated in Asia and was transmitted into Europe from the Mongolian Empire's commerce system, only killed about 30% of the inhabitants.</p>
<p>The author also uses the Asian conception of reincarnation as a core factor, with time on Earth intended to follow the Buddhist path to nirvana. Interludes between lives are spent in the Bardo and souls are each part of a jati, or family, which are reincarnated together and then meet up in the Bardo to evaluate the previous life. The deities who control existence require everyone to drink a forgetting potion just prior to rebirth.</p>
<p>The jati which is the focus of the story has three main members, with a couple of others in much smaller roles. Their personalities are consistent while names change each lifetime (but always start with B, K and I) and I'm guessing each of the three represents an archetype. B is (almost) always the peacemaker and facilitator, K is aggressive and a leader, and I is inquisitive, a scientist; sometimes they're men, sometimes women, sometimes a mix.</p>
<p>The novel begins just after the Black Death makes its final pass through Europe. In this life B is a trusted lieutenant of Tamerlane (Temur the Lame) and encounters the vast emptiness while scouting the next battle, in or near Hungary. He soon 'meets' K, who is a 10 year old African taken as a slave by the Arab traders who already have him.</p>
<p>Robinson moves the group around, through China, India, Iran, Firanja (Islamic Europe, resettled 100 years after the plague) and a North America where the native tribes weren't conquered by Europeans and were able to largely fight off the Chinese and Muslim invasions of the West and East coasts respectively.</p>
<p>He covers the 600 years or so from the time of the plague until today--this is no shortshrifted or puffed up book but a solid, dense 700 pager. In his history the major powers are a consistently authoritarian China and a fractious, but much larger territorially, Dar es Islam, with a small but smart South Indian league taking a significant role. Robinson consistently picks interesting spots to set down the jati; generally close to, but rarely in, positions of power.</p>
