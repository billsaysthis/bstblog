<p>Mark Cuban had <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/1234000260025530/">the same idea</a> as I wrote up <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_12_26_blog_archive.phtml#110443071933041648">yesterday</a>: Cancel the party, extravaganza functions at Bush's inauguration.
