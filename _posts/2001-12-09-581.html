<p><strong>Goodbye: George Young</strong></p>
<p>One of the great football executives <a href="http://msn.espn.go.com/classic/obit/s/2001/1208/1292401.html">died today</a> after a short illness. George Young brought a semblance of peace to the feuding Mara family immediately after being named general manager of the Giants and then brought championships to a team that spent the '60s and '70s in the cellar by drafting Phil Simms and Lawrence Taylor and hiring Bill Parcells as coach. I remember spending many Augusts and Septembers debating the personnel choices he and Parcells made but in the end they delivered playoff wins and two Super Bowls. He was quiet and never looked for the spotlight. leaving that to his coaches, but he knew the game and how to win. AP sportswriter Stephen Hawkins has a <a href="http://wire.ap.org/APnews/center_story.html?FRONTID=FOOTBALL&amp;STORYID=APIS7G9S9CG0">nice remembrance</a> as well. Thanks for the memories George, I hope your lifting a brew with your dad in his new tavern in the hearafter.</p>
