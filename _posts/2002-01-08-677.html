<p><strong>Strange dreams</strong></p>
<p>I will tell you that I've had some strange dreams lately. Some people in a <a href="http://chat.msn.com">chat room</a> I frequent have been talking about going to Las Vegas in May. So the last few nights I have had dreams where I am in a casino but not nice ones like they have in Vegas. And each night something strange happens that wouldn't in a real casino. Like last night, I was playing craps and instead of paying me off on a small bet, like $20, the casino workers took me and my buddy (not Byron, oddly enough) and dragged us out into the middle of nowhere, punched us a little, and then left us there. We had to struggle to find our way back to the city and then confront them, which is when I woke up. The previous night I met a beautiful woman at the casino bar, a different casino, and she asked if I wanted to play (gamble!) with her. I said sure and she took me over to a section where they dealt out cards and then played some kind of bingo-like game, where players sat in tall chairs with no table in front of them. Very odd, eh?</p>
