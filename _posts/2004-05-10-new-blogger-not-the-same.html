<p>Honestly, I'm not sure I love the new Blogger editing interface. The old version, with it's split between an authoring frame and the recent posts frame, was more appealing to me and I've never been terribly interested in adding comments, with the recent comment spam wars only adding to my disinterest. The goofy graphic displayed while waiting for an article to publish seems like a waste. Here's a situation where having a personal installation might have made a difference.</p>
