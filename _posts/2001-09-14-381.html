<p><b>Martyrdom: perversion of Islam or mainstream view?</b></p>
<p>Many commentators, Islamic and otherwise, have said that suicide bombers are a perversion of the Koran. If that's true, then why is so prominent and presumably mainstream a cleric as the Chief Mufti of the Palestinean Authority extoll the glories of the bomber? Aluma Solnick in her paper <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/dunia-islam@yahoogroups.com/msg01032.html">The Joy of the Mothers of Palestinian 'Martyrs'</a> explores some historical background that clearly establishes martyrdom as a longstanding heroic role in Islam.</p>
