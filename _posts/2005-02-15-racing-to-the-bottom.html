<p>Are you living in California? Did you receive a letter last week from a company called <a href="http://www.choicepoint.com/">ChoicePoint</a>? If you did, I hope you paid attention and didn't toss it as just another piece of junk mail. MSNBC reports in <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6969799/">Database giant gives access to fake firms</a> that more than 30,000 people in this state may be identity theft victims after some smart asses posing as a real company bought personal dossiers from ChoicePoint. Of course the company is hardly saying anything, nor is it taking any responsibility, hiding for months behind the skirts of an "ongoing law enforcement investigation" excuse.</p>
