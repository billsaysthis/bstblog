<p>Don't let Shan and her evil posse do it to you! Resist <a href="http://caterwauling.com/blog/archive/2003_07_01_caterwauling_archive.html#105889708263907593">the urgings</a> to join them. Well, at least until you have the right guy to be more than just a donor. I hear too many people these days talking about "my baby's daddy" and that kind of trash. So just keep looking and tell Shan you'll be the best Auntie you can be. ROFL.</p>
