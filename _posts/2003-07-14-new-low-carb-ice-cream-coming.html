<p>I was invited to a taste test this afternoon at a market research firm's office in Redwood City (<a href="http://www.tragon.com/">Tragon Research</a>, if you want to sign up as a tester). I wasn't invited because I'm an Atkins blogger, but because I signed up to participate in their testing and I qualified for this research by answering four questions on the phone. The idea was to earn some extra cash for a bit of my time while still job hunting.</p>
<p>The test was not bad, took less than 30 minutes from walking to walking out. Very simple, too: I had to rate either two or four different flavors of sugar-free vanilla ice cream, first on about half dozen factors such as vanilla taste, color, sweetness, aftertaste, would I purchase it, and overall. I'm not sure how many flavors altogether because first I was given a small scoop of ice cream, filled the form out, and then repeated this. Then I was given, at one time, two separate bowls each with a scoop of vanilla, asked to taste each and then simply select which I preferred.</p>
<p>So the second set could have been the same flavors as the first but the flavors all tasted very similar. The ice cream was very good, no aftertaste, not too sweet, which is a problem with a number of low carb foods I've tried (such as the CarbLite chocolate bars). I wonder if someone else is planning to enter the low carb ice cream market. I hope it was low carb, otherwise I will be unhappy tomorrow when I weigh in! LOL, got paid though, got my $25 check!</p>
