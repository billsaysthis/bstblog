<p>My <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2005_05_15_blog_archive.phtml#111673736099682218">previous post</a> might seem like I watch too much TV. This is possibly true. That's just a prime time schedule. You may have noticed I seem to watch a lot of soccer too. This is also true, for instance I'll be taking Wednesday off as comp time so I can see <a href="http://www.uefa.com/competitions/UCL/FixturesResults/Round=1972/Match=1086988/index.html">Liverpool take on Milan</a>. There are no excuses, just what I do.</p>
