<p>I've been using Alessandro Fulciniti's terrific JavaScript library since redesigning this site last Summer. Now he's released <a href="http://pro.html.it/niftycube/">Nifty Corners Cube</a>, an even better implementation of his ideas, and I've upgraded the site to it. Unfortunately, at least for me, there seems to be a problem with one bit which breaks it on Internet Explorer--of course all of you are using Firefox, Safari, Camino or Opera and can't see the problem, right? Or reading via RSS, also no problem. Hopefully I'll get a resolution soon or drop back to the old version but if you know the fix or workaround, please do let me know.</p>
