<p><b>Math is based on certainty, right?</b>
<p>Everyone knows that mathematics is based on the pure rock of certainty, right? Sorry guess again: Gregory Chaitin, <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/features/features.jsp?id=ns22811">New Scientist: The Omega Man</a>, a mathematics researcher at IBM's T. J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, has shown that mathematicians can't actually prove very much at all. </p>
<p>Waiting for the brainiacs to publish the oh-so-close Theory of Everything? Don't hold your beath because until this gaping hole can be closed there ain't no such thing.</p>
