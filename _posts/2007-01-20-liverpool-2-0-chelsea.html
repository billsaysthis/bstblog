<p>In a crucial Barclays English Premier League home match today the Reds <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/6258681.stm">took cruel advantage</a> of Chelsea's injury troubles and squad disarray to score twice in the opening 18 minutes. The first goal came from Dirk Kuyt, off Peter Crouch's foot, and soon after Jermaine Pennant got his first goal for the club with a dipping blast from the right side of the penalty area.</p>
<p>Peter Cech made an early return from his fractured skull, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/6277719.stm">wearing an ungainly head protector</a>, but Jose Mourinho had to start Michael Essien and Paulo Ferreira in central defense as Khalid Boulahrouz has a knee injury, Ricardo Carvalho took ill over night and John Terry's back has still not recovered while left back Wayne Bridge also has a knee problem and Claude Makele was suspended from cards, and the Reds came out blasting against the improvised defensive core. Winger Arjen Robben had to leave after 20 minutes after twisting an ankle.</p>
<p>Today was Rafa Benitez's 100th EPL game so he knew the opening minutes were critical and had the team prepared. The precious three points pulls the 'Pool within five points of the Blues in the standings, only one behind in the goal difference tiebreaker, and leave a visit from hated Gunners at the end of March and a trip to Old Trafford two weeks later as the only remaining Big Four matchups.</p>
<p>The next three games, before the boys travel to Spain for the first leg of their Champions League tussle with Ronaldinho's Barcelona, are West Ham, a derby with Everton and Newcastle could yield 7-9 points if current form holds. Defeating the Spanish champions could give the team a real boost towards a second European trophy in three seasons!</p>
