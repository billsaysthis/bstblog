<p>[<a href="http://www.mcalisterdesigns.com/blog/dotcom_predictions.php">via</a>] Last year I made several predctions that now seem ridiculously sleazy.  But a few ideas were pretty close.  I've got a feeling that 2006 will be a big year, and here are some of the reasons why:
<ol>
<li>A Mt View startup is going to open our eyes to some new ways that <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a> can influence culture.  <a href="http://www.analogsf.com/">Analog SF</a> will pick up on this and run several cover stories on the founders.</li>
<li>Larry Ellison will be in the spotlight for his decision to support CSS.  This will upset <a href="http://www.kalsey.com/">Adam Kalsey</a>, and the blogosphere will react baldly.  The noise will quiet before the end of the year and it will all be forgotten soon after the shock.</li>
<li>Excite@Home will see their stock skyrocket after their eyeballs business starts taking off.  We've seen it coming for a while now, but 2006 will be the year it really kicks into gear.</li>
<li>Either eBay or Chemdex will seek to expand their mashup business by acquiring RawSugar.  NetDynamics will be overlooked in the process, and they will see a management shakeout later in the year.</li>
<li>One of the big leaders in the Newspaper industry will wake up to the opportunity in the Internet and the Web 2.0 trends.  After months of speculation, they will make a key acquisition that will shake up the landscape for years to come.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: I clearly misunderstood the intended use of some of the fields in Mike's post generator.</p>
