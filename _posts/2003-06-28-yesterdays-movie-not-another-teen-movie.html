<p>A romp, a giggle and tickle, a little of the old wink wink nudge nudge with American accents. From the writers of <em>Scary Movies I &amp; II</em>, comes <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Credits?0277371">Not Another Teen Movie</a>, sendng up teen romance flicks the way their other film did the teen horror genre. Perhaps not quite as successfully, but still worth 90 minutes of lifespan on cable. Mix together the following and add some Mike Myers influence: <em>She's All That</em>, <em>Can't Hardly Wait</em>, <em>Varsity Blues</em>, the <em>American Pies</em>, plus every '80s John Hughes movie you can remember. In fact, the high school in the film is actually named for Hughes, Molly Ringwald makes a cameo, and Paul Gleason reprises his <em>Breakfast Club</em> role and detention room riff. Lots of laughs.</p>
