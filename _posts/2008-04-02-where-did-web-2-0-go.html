<p>Okay, this is perhaps a small complaint and not all about Web 2.0. Still, every major JavaScript UI library includes an auto-complete function so why don't major sites such as IMDB have it on their search boxes? Marketo, of course, has it on every user input widget where it can work. If we can do it, why can't Amazon?</p>
