<p><a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCamp" rel="tag">BarCamp</a> just did a round of introductions and now people are sorting out some sessions for tonight and other logistics. Pretty sizable group though definitely going to be stragglers or people not showing until tomorrow. At least 40-50 so far, more virtually through IRC.</p>
<p>Mike Price from <a href="http://www.mobido.com/">mobido.com</a> is talking about his service. Allows ad hoc groups to exchange pictures and communicatons without exposing personal information (anonymizes everybody), mainly through camphones.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">8:00:</span> Ross Mayfield is talking/leading discussion about how we can capture the event for others/posterity and also <a href="http://barcamp.org/index.cgi?FooBarLink">link in people from FooCamp</a> and virtual participants. How to enhance communication inside the sessions as well. He's showing the site SocialText set up for <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/tsunamihelp/index.cgi">the Tsunami Help group</a> (in the wake of last December's Indian Ocean disaster)</p>
<p>Hey <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scoble</a>, I see someone writing on a TabletPC across the room.</p>
<p>Ross: There is no clapping at BarCamp!</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">8:40:</span> Niall Kennedy is starting a session on Blogging For Profit. Ads? Content for ads, ads for content? Different types of ads: text/CPC (Google, Yahoo), affiliate/CPL (Amazon, porn, eBay), CPL++ (mortgage, travel, jobs), salary++ (personal fame/fortune, new job/promotion). Different motivations for each, different presentation.</p>
<p>Salary, CPL can be monetized through RSS, ads not so much. Also, blog for hire (blogging as a job, weblogs.com, gawker) and personal merchandise are revenue sources suggested by kevinkurioso of <a href="http://www.ok-cancel.com/">ok-cancel.com</a>.</p>
<p>What is the appropriate level of disclosure when money is in play? Level of trust is important to establish. Ads on the site is implied disclosure but other instances may require explicit mention--talking about a product for a fee, or about competitors. (Slouching towards Xanadu...)</p>
<p>Since new media is disrupting ad spending, should advertisers look for new ways to get better content? Example: Getting better cameras to photobloggers. Measurement of traffic, especially inbound, is a key statistic. Look at previous new media, like pamphlets back in Franklin's time, same outburst and then flowed into a more sensible/mature space.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=family2&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=bill_at_barcamp1_081805.jpg">capture of me</a> from the webcam for posterity. In the white shirt, head over the laptop. Talking of meta... Here's the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/BarCamp">Flickr photostream</a> including Niall Kennedy's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/niallkennedy/35501573/">shot of me</a>, and the <a href="http://www.buzznet.com/buzzwords/BarCamp">Buzznet stream</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of the salary++ stream, Ryan King told of how he got his gig at Technorati because people there noticed his blog posts on <a href="http://www.microformats.org/">microformats</a>. Leading to a discussion of people posting their reviews to Amazon versus on their own blogs. The network effect of Amazon makes the reviews more appealing to readers while microformats like <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hreview">hReview</a> may allow similar aggregation while retaining the content locally.</p>
<p>When does someone cross the line between making content for internal reasons rather than because it may offer cash/reward. Many good stories about people making meaningful amounts off their blog but like most other things it's a small number capturing most of the cash.</p>
