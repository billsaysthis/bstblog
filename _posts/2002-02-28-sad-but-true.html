<p>Richard Cohen comments on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A2176-2002Feb25.html">Why Daniel Pearl Died</a>: "But I don't think I am being irrational when I say that the hideous murder of Daniel Pearl was not just the work of 'barbarians' -- the phrase du jour to describe his killers -- but the inevitable result of policy. Throughout the once-tolerant Islamic world, anti-Semitism -- hatred of Jews -- has become both common and acceptable." More and more, the truth about the Arab world, that the governments, the so-called peaceful moderates, are as much to blame for the hatred of Jews and Americans as the radical Islamists like bin Laden. The biggest difference is that the radicals aren't two-faced liars. Still bad though.</p>
<p>My father adds his two cents: "This is, indeed, very sad, and perpetuated in large part by those who would keep their populaces in ignorance and poverty, while blaming everything on a convenient scapegoat. What should happen is a program of using Muslim Americans who can carry a different message to those parts of the world. I don't know if it's possible, but it can't hurt a lot to try."</p>
