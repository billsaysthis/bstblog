<p>Five straight wins over Notre Dame. 33 straight home wins. 20-0 in November in the Pete Carroll era. Five Pac-10 titles under Coach Carroll. Three of the past four Heisman Trophy winners, even if no one stood out enough this season to even earn a trip to the ceremony.</p>
<p>What a game tonight! Three touchdown drives to open the game before the Fighting Irish managed to get a field goal. John David Booty did have a letdown in the second quarter, throwing a couple of INTs, but cleared his head during the half and lead the crew to another TD on the opening drive of the third quarter.</p>
<p>Mike Jarret on offense--Pac-10 career receiving touchdown record holder--and Dallas Sarks on defense were the standouts, with ND QB Brady Quinn throwing for 274 and running for 74 more battling as hard as he could despite finishing with an 0-4 mark against us. Amazing play of the game has to be Brian Cushing, a linebacker turned defense end, who returned Notre Dame's onside kick with 3:39 left in the game 42 yards for the final score--he caught the ball on the run and kept going, totally surprising the Irish kick defense.</p>
<p>Can't overlook UCLA, but we ought to get a shot at Ohio State in the BCS title game on January 8, don't you think? Fourth straight year we're in the title mix.</p>
