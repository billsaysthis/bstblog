<p>On the sad side of the ledger, my sister's father-in-law passed away this past weekend. I only met Larry Sr. a few times, him living in Florida, but no one could miss his terrific friendliness and appetite for life. I know from talking with my sister that he was a wonderful guy who made her feel like a daughter and not just an in-law, that when he loved you he loved you with all he had. My brother-in-law is a great guy and clearly the apple was dropped only inches from the tree. Only 65, he will be missed.</p>
