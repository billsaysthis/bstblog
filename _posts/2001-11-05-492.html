<p><b>Today's movie: Monsters, Inc.</b></p>
<p>We scare because we care. And how true and sweet that saying really is coming from the mouths of John Goodman and Bill Crystal. You can read plenty of reviews of <a href="http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/monstersinc/index2.html">Monsters, Inc.</a>, so I won't go into it here except to say that this movie is the first must see film in months. I read Friday that one of the reasons <a href="http://www.pixar.com">Pixar</a> movies are so consistently good is because the actual production is so demanding and lengthy that the script has to be great to justify the effort. As an extra treat, Pixar has posted <a href="http://www.pixar.com/shorts/index.html">several short films</a> to the site, definitely worth watching.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Lots of people agreed with my assessment as this film took in $63.5 million in its opening weekend, setting a new record for animated films (blowing past Toy Story 2's 1999 $57M bow) and reaching #6 for all films. Toy Story 2 ended up with a $485 million box office total and Disney execs are rubbing themselves silly with such an unexpected result. Jet Li's The One took second with $20M and I am going to disregard some friend's less-than-stellar reviews and see it anyway.</p>
