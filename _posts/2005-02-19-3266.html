<p>CD Review: <a href="http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/2005/02/10/pf-928078.html">Michael Buble: It's Time</a>. But not really. I mean, I saw this kid on <em>Las Vegas</em> a few months back and so what if his debut album sold three million copies, Daniel Sterdan's review is spot on without even hearing one track just for the bull's eye quip about producer "soulless svengali David Foster." Lennie Kravitz, whose <em>Stand By Your Woman</em>, is covered here, is certainly happy in the pocketbook but miserable in his soul if he had to listen to this version even once. Taste is subjective but damn, this is not possibly worth the cost of a blank CD to burn a copy dowloaded off a torrent!</p>
