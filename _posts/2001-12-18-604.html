<p><strong>Who will watch the watchers?</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to ragging on the man who takes himself just a mite too seriously, I depend on the Zaphods at <a href="http://winerlog.editthispage.com/">WinerLog</a>. But just when Dave comes up with an almost-too-easy target in the <a href="http://www.scripting.com/awards/2001/">Scripting News Awards</a>, they let me down and don't have a pie in the face ready. The Romans had a saying which I've used to title this entry, "Quis Custodiet ipsos Custodes?"</p>
