<p>While others seem to be enamored of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dylanesque-Bryan-Ferry/dp/B000LPR0SE/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-3138032-6507105?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1182999630&amp;sr=1-1">Dylanesque</a>, Bryan Ferry's brand new CD of Bob Dylan covers, I can't say the same. After hearing him do <span style="font-style:italic;">Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues</span> on last night's Letterman and another song (maybe <span style="font-style:italic;">Positively 4th Street</span>?) on the radio last week my question is why?</p>
<p>I'm hard-pressed to pick a good rock and roll singer less suited to Dylan's music than Ferry. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of both. I love listening to Ferry singing <span style="font-style:italic;">Jealous Guy</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Slave to Love </span>or <span style="font-style:italic;">Avalon</span> and his work with Roxy Music was great too. There aren't words enough to cover Robert Zimmerman's immense achievements.</p>
<p>But really, Dylan is all about rough edges, contrasts and keeping the music barely this edge of chaos while Ferry is smooth and polished, more at home in a tuxedo than just about any other rock star. There's almost enough stinging lead and slide guitar to push Ferry's interpretations into a good place, but I still come down on the side of the question asked in the post title.</p>
