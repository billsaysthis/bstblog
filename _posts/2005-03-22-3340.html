<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/4365951.stm">Liverpool hit by striker crisis</a>. Probably the least painful time for the remainder of the season this could have happened, with two weeks off until the next match and Baros' suspension not affecting the subsequent Champions League match in Italy, but one really has to wonder where this will lead. As in down the EPL table and right out of any European qualification for next season. As of now, the only strikers who can play against Bolton on 2 April are Anthony Le Tallec and David Raven and I don't believe either has ever started a regular game for the Reds.</p>
