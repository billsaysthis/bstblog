<p><strong>Forget the plasma TV, this is what I want</strong></p>
<p>How about a flying vehicle that can carry a single person 120+ miles at 70 knots? That's the promise of the <a href="http://www.solotrek.com/mjet/index1.html">SoloTrek XFV</a>:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/solonew_web.jpg" height="150" alt="artist drawing of the test SoloTrek" /></p>
<p>The machine can handle a payload of 277 pounds plus fuel, so I best be dieting soon, cause this will surely be the way to avoid those damn 101 traffic jams. It is a vertical take off and landing device, so no runway is needed, and the version that goes on sale will include GPS so pilots won't get lost and an ejector seat for when things go really wrong. The SoloTrek is still in the early test phase, so far the longest admitted flight is hovering three feet off the ground for 19 seconds and there is no published schedule for reaching production.</p>
<p>Millenium Jet, the company building this marvel, is over in Sunnyvale and I wonder when they'll need a test pilot.</p>
