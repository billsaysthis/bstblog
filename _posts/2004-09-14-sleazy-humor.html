<p>Some company named Pantheon is trying to take money from suckers via something called an EasyLink internet machine, or so I gather from their TV ads. Which star Ernest Borgnine. Which really makes me wonder how stupid the people running Pantheon really are if they think Ernest Borgnine has any meaningful credibility in regards to any kind of technology. Then again, their target demographic is people stupid enough to lay out a "minimal upfront investment."</p>
