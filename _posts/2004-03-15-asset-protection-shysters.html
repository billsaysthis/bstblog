<p>I've been hearing an ad on the radio, mainly on <a href="http://www.kfox.com/">KFOX</a>, for at least the last few weeks encouraging people who want to become independently wealthy to sign up for a program to learn to be an "asset protection consultant." There are billions of dollars to be had floating around helping other wealthy folks involved in lawsuits. One lawyer, Flyod Tapia, thinks such schemes are <a href="http://www.articlecity.com/articles/legal/article_38.shtml">fine and dandy</a> as long as "lifetime, incumbent judges and bleeding-heart juries [hand] out ludicrous decisions."</p>
<p>Not something that really appeals to me but it did make me curious. And so when I googled the phrase this morning, right at the top was <a href="http://www.quatloos.com/asset_protection_shysters.htm">this page</a> on a scambuster website. What a shock, eh? One might think that a station owned by the mighty Clear Channel Communications would be a bit more selective in who gets access to its air time but then again, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;c2coff=1&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=Clear+channel&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=www.metafilter.com&amp;safe=images">probably not</a>.</p>
