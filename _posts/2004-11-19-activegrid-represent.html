<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://home.pacbell.net/pyared/minires.html">Peter Yared</a>, who I worked with at NetDynamics (we bought his early all-Java IDE company JRad) and Sun, came out of stealth mode with his new company ActiveGrid and <a href="http://www.activegrid.com/news/pressrelease-111704.php">announced funding</a> from two major VC firms. Interesting, positive commentary from the <a href="http://www.looselycoupled.com/blog/lc00aa00074.html">LooselyCoupled blog</a> and <a href="http://phplens.com/phpeverywhere/?q=node/view/137">PHPEverywhere</a>. He also has a strong manager working with him, a guy I knew at Sun named Jeff Veis, and the two VC board members are tech legends: Mitchell Kertzman (Liberate, Sybase, Powersoft) and Jean-Louise Gassee (Apple, Be).</p>
<p>Best of luck to Peter and Crew, and best wishes that your next generation application server be even more successful than the one we all did together.<a href="http://www.looselycoupled.com/blog/lc00aa00074.html"></a><br /></p>
