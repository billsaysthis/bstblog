<p><strong>More on the East Palo Alto politicians</strong></p>
<p>Following up on the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_01_06_blog_archive.phtml#8554449">previously mentioned stupidity</a>, the City of Palo Alto terminated police seargant Robert Cole yesterday but no explanation of the reasoning behind this decision was made public. So the city has decided to defy a court order to rehire Cole, after already leaving themselves open to further liability for refusing to allow Cole to return to active duty. The city is appealing the court decision, spending more of the limited funds they have available in the Peninsula's poorest city. Cole's lawyer estimates his legal fees, which the city is almost certainly going to have to pay, at $250,000 and says the city has likely spent a similar amount for their lawyers. Now add a big chunk to both tabs for the appeal and possible damages and/or fines that will be assessed going forward and the East Palo Alto could easily be out a cool million. Dollars, that is. Bills. Bucks. Benjamins. Like they don't need the money desperately for schools, roads, hell they have had to cut spending on their police force in recent years.</p>
