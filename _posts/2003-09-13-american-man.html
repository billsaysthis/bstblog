<p>Johnny Cash is gone, not a surprise after long illness and the hole in his heart where June used to live, but he left behind some immense, moving works. Check out his video of <a href="http://www.losthighwayrecords.com/johnnycash/music.html" title="Click through, then scroll down for choice of media">Hurt</a>, his last video. A dark and heavy ballad, this is actually Johnny's take on a Nine Inch Nails tune transformed into slow country blues. The video compares and contrasts Cash at 70 with his younger self and since it was made a while back, June was still alive and is touchingly behind him, a profound presence.</p>
<p>A sad second loss this week indeed.</p>
