<p>I was supposed to go to <a href="http://startupschool.org">Startup School</a> today over at Stanford but, with apologies to Paul Graham and crew and despite the outstanding speaker lineup, after the past week I just didn't feel like sitting in a huge auditorium with five hundred or so not so close friends.</p>
<p>So TS1 and I took off late morning to drive to Half Moon Bay. I love driving on 280, it's always wide open and the scenery is just beautiful. Green hills, towering trees, low-hanging clouds riding atop the mountain ridge like frosting on a cake. Amazingly, my sweetie's never really been there despite living in SF or MtnVw her entire life. I lived a few miles north, in El Granada, just after moving out here but haven't been back much since.</p>
<p>We had a pretty nice lunch at Pasta Moon to celebrate my recent hiring and some good news of her own at work. One word of advice: the guy at the next table ordered the lasagna and it was fraking huge! Think of the huge piles of meat sandwiches served at, say, Carnegie Deli and translate that to lasagna. Seriously, the thing must have been six inches high or more. So if you want to have it, pay the $2 sharing charge and go halves.</p>
<p>Afterwards we walked up and down Main St., window shopping or browsing. There are few nice stores there, one in particular tempted us with fine wood offerings but our credit card stayed in the wallet. The downside to HMB is that, while it was a beautiful sunny day here the clouds were closing in there and since I'm still recovering from the strep we only walked for about an hour.</p>
<p>What a nice break, away from computers, work and TVs with my sweetie!</p>
