<p>The Sweet One made me some tasty ribs tonight. I love eating her cooking. Makes married life even more wonderful.</p>
<p>Mainly has been a semi-lazy day, as a good Summer Saturday ought to be. We did get up early and go the gym, eat some breakfast and then I drove TS1 to the office so she could earn some overtime $$$. I then enjoyed the Manchester United 2-1 victory over Newcastle. Really, I couldn't care which team won as they aren't Liverpool but I'm infatuated with ManU's new American goalkeeper Tim Howard and their awesome goalscorer Ruud van Nistleroy and both of them had excellent games.</p>
<p>I had to deal with far too many of the SoBig-generated emails. That was a midday downer.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I got an eBay tutorial from PowerSeller and buddy <a href="http://cgi2.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback&amp;userid=rogulus">Rogulus</a>--do you see that rating? <em>+2815</em> is very impressive. He gave me a bunch of good tips and I'll be putting them into effect this week with auctions on some extra equipment I have laying about, some clothes, maybe some music CDs. Just waiting for my PayPal account to go into effect.</p>
<p>To top off the day, the 49ers are beating the Saints at the half and after dinner coffee is brewing.</p>
