<p>One of the amusements found on the web is that many times an ad network (for instance, Google AdSense) will match opposite points of view. For instance, <a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/index.html">Bad Astronomy</a>  debunks junk science while advertising on its home page today is Michael Mozina's <a href="http://www.thesurfaceofthesun.com/">The Surface of the Sun</a>.</p>
<p>TSotS is a site using material (apparently images and movie files) from recent scientific missions (Hubble, Chandra and so forth) to explain that below the photosphere our Sun has a "hard and rigid ferrite surface." In an attempt to be fair to Mozina I skimmed every page on his site plus the PDF file of the article he submitted to <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/">The Astrophysical Journal</a>. Mainly I was looking for any signs of a mathematical formula underpinning the pretty radical assertions of this theory and of course found none, nor did he offer any in a <a href="http://www.christianforums.com/t1699184-the-surface-of-the-sun.html.">rather lengthy and argumentative thread</a> on a Christian message board when confronted by people who seemed to be actual scientists.</p>
