<p>Romantic comedy isn't easy. There are far too many ways to fall into cliches, to make plot movements through a simple wave of the hands or lose it by poor casting of the loving couple. <a href="http://www.howtoloseaguymovie.com/">How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</a> is not the perfect example of a romantic comedy but it doesn't fall off the pier due to any of those three common pitfalls and ends up delivering an enjoyable couple of hours.</p>
<p>Matthew McConaughey has the kind of relaxed, soft pace that lends itself well, as he's shown in <em>EdTV</em> and <em>The Wedding Planner</em> (though he was badly matched in the latter with Jennifer Lopez); he doesn't show nearly as well in the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141926/">big</a> action <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120769/">films</a> he apparently prefers. Kate Hudson gets a bit beyond the generic in this film, especially in the scenes where she's going bonkers on the guy, though I'd suggest she get some better advice in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0205271/">role</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318283/">selection</a>.</p>
<p>Director Donald Petrie has pretty bland oevre but seems to hit the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095690/">occasional</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107050/">double</a>, give him credit for a light touch here where he could have gone overboard--the bits with Mrs. DeLauer and Hudson's girlfriend pretending to be a therapist, for instance. The soundtrack was reasonably memorable too, and made nice use of the classic Carly Simon tune <em>You're So Vain</em>. An enjoyable diversion.</p>
<p><em>recommended</em></p>
