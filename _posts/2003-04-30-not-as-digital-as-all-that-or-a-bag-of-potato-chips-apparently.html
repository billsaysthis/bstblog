<p>You'd think finding some type of contact information for someone as public, digital, and visible as <a href="http://www.edge.org/digerati/brockman/index.html">John Brockman</a> would be simple but it's not. Even on the website for his <a href="http://www.edge.org">Edge Foundation</a>, the only kind of useful thing is a mailto link for editor@edge.org. He has/owns/runs a high profile literary agency called Brockman, Inc. but <a href="http://www.brockman.com">that website</a> is "under construction." So old fashioned but I had to look the company up in the <a href="http://yp.superpages.com/listings.phtml?WL=brockman,%20inc.&amp;N=brockman,%20inc.&amp;STYPE=S&amp;T=new%20york&amp;S=NY&amp;PG=L&amp;R=N&amp;PS=15">white pages</a>!</p>
