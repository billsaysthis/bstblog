<p>I haven't mentioned <a href="http://www.rawsugar.com/search/">RawSugar</a> lately but that's because I get so wrapped up in it during the day that I need the evenings to unwind, recharge and do my own thing for a few hours. But seeing <a href="http://rob.crabapples.net/2006/03/i-love-rawsugar.htm">Rob's sweet post</a> today, <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Techcrunch?m=647">Mike Arrington's post</a> on TechCrunch and <a href="http://www.rawsugar.com/links/dangerousmeta">Garret's increasing use</a> reminded me it was time to catch you all up.</p>
<p>The company's doing quite well. We had our official launch a few weeks ago <a href="http://www.demo.com/demonstrators/demo2006/63026.html">at DEMO 2006</a>, you can watch Ofer's presentation at that link, and so the BETA label is gone. No perpetual betas for this web 2.0 crew. You can get our fancy new Firefox extension, complete with toolbar, at <a href="http://www.rawsugar.com/lab">the new lab</a>. Also featured on the lab is extensive documentation on <a href="http://www.rawsugar.com/doc/api">our very comprehensive API</a> and you can see it put to good use in <a href="http://rob.crabapples.net/2006/02/rawsugar-plugin-update.htm">Rob Fahrni's add in</a> that lets you tag to your directory right from within .Net-based RSS aggregators like SharpReader and RSS Bandit. I just finished preparing a Help system so new it's still with the developers but trust me, it's much cooler than three day old cheese pizza.</p>
<p>Haven't been to RawSugar lately? You owe it to yourself to <a href="http://www.rawsugar.com">stop by</a> and see why I'm happy to be coming up on my one year anniversary working there in two short weeks.</p>
