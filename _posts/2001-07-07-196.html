<p><b>Yesterday's fun: moving boxes and couches</b><br />

<p>Okay, so it wasn't quite as much fun as, say, being slapped upside the head by an <a href="http://www.rapdict.org/terms/o">O.G.</a>. I spent the morning helping a friend move a truckload of an aunt's material possessions from another relative's backyard to a <a href="http://www.publicstorage.com/">Public Storage</a> space. We were told the space was 6'x12' and that would have been true if the space was rectangular, but it wasn't. More heavy lifting than I've done in a long, long time but oddly enough I didn't mind.</p>
