<p>1988 Australia, a drunken backup singer finds herself unemployed and stranded in a backwater town where she runs across her daughter in Gillian Anderson's <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0095305">High Tide</a>. Judy Davis, who's also done some work over here (last year she got an Emmy nomination for playing Judy Garland on Showtime), stars as the women who has to come to terms with her cowardice. Anderson has also directed some notable films--My Beautiful Career, Little Women, and last year's Charlotte Gray--but this one doesn't do much. The ending especially is a disappointment. <em>Not recommended</em></p>
