<p>Even Scoble says he cannot help on this but I want one nonetheless. This new machine is really tasty and then I have to run ugly old Office 2000 apps like Outlook and Word. Don't get me started on OpenOffice or Mozilla Thunderbird, I've tried them and let's just chalk it up to a "tastes great/less filling" situation. So who out there can snag me a copy? Someone? Bueller?</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.crabapples.net/rob/">Rob</a>, an MS staffer (Visio developer) and all-around Harry Potter fan, caught the post and asked why I just didn't . My response? <em>D'oh!</em> But then I also noticed that the beta copy 'expires' on Nov. 30th, which kind of defeats my 'get a free copy' strategy. Oh well, maybe next time.</p>
