<p><b>Today's Movie: Shrek</b><br />

<p>Want laughs? See <a href="http://www.shrek.com">Shrek</a>, it's as simple as that. There are constant jokes, many out of Donkey's (Eddie Murphy's) mouth. Mike Myers uses just the right amount of restraint on his Scottish accent (shades of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0108174">I Married An Axe Murderer</a>) as the title character, Cameron Diaz plays the princess with good ups and downs, and John Lithgow plays to form as the bad Lord Farquaad. Through in lots of pop culture references (Disney, Matrix, <a href="http://www.monkees.net/" title="Amusingly, these guys, minus Nesmith, are still touring">the Monkees</a>) and it's a 90 minute ride to Storybook Funnyville.</p>
