<p><strong>Gettin' biz-zay!</strong></p>
<p>A Santa Cruz woman named Lish Daelnar hopes to eventually chart every sexual pairing on Earth in ASCII in the <a href="http://www.attrition.org/hosted/sexchart/sexchart.9.25">Sexchart</a>. She also wants to get written up in Wired but Wired News will do as well, so she's <a href="http://wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,48997,00.html">achieved that</a>. Somehow I don't seem to be on the chart yet--I'm not BigDaddyBill--but I'm looking it over to see if I connected with anyone listed. Should you be on here? After all, Courtney Love, Drew Barrymore, and Jello Biafra are. All it takes is a wet kiss or better with someone already listed. Note: most folks (Goddess4U, shewolf, extrabob) are shown by their online handle so if I do get on, it will be as capspace.</p>
