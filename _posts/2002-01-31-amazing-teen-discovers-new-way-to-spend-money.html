<p>Sometimes I just wonder about my fellow humans. Not that they are <a href="http://www.larryellison.com">greedy</a> or <a href="http://www.cnn.com/resources/newsmakers/world/middle.east/saddam.html">violent</a>, which are cause enough for wonder, but that they do really stupid things like the girl in this <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/020131/168/11io0.html">Yahoo! News photo</a> and then go after publicity for doing it. Of course in this case the blame has to go to her parents for allowing the publicity. And yeah, like teenagers never found ways to run up huge phone bills before. Oh wait, they must have or else why would The Simpsons have lampooned it?</p>
