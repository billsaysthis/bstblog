<p>Just finished watching the <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/9_11/">9/11 documentary</a> by the <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/9_11/filmmakers.shtml">Naudet brothers and James Hanlon</a> on CBS. The effect was like going into shock once again but compelling, a show I wanted to turn off, wanted to pretend was a fiction but just could not as the pictures were all too real. The non-chalant bravery of the firefighters and other emergency services personnel as captured on tape was simply unbelievable; I know I could not have stood in there, climbing up the stairs, helping people, directing traffic, while the chaos was enveloping everything around me. Fighting fires takes a special kind of person and I'm glad there are many of them in America.</p>
