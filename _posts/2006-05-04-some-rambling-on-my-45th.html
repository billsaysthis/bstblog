<p>I will open by stating the obvious: I have had an easy, comfortable, enjoyable life.</p>
<p>My parents are still alive and married to each other and through their generosity and the lessons they taught I have never gone hungry for as much as a meal, never spent a night outside because I had no place to call home, never been cold on a winter day because I couldn't buy a coat. I've never broken a bone, seen anyone die in my presence, been the victim of a real violent crime, served in the military or even fired a gun in anger (or at all since summer camp when I was 12).</p>
<p>No life, of course, is perfect and so my years have had their downs. I was mugged by four teenagers in Asbury Park when I was one myself but other than being held by one and threatened with a big stick by another but only lost the $6.25 and an otherwise empty cheap wallet. I've suffered from anxiety for over 25 years and have barely adequate eyesight, and have chubby to fat since I was 10 despite years of efforts to get thin by eating right and exercising. Apparently too much and not enough respectively. I've been divorced.</p>
<p>Getting divorced, though, meant I was single when I met Vivian which I think is the most wonderful day in these 45 years. No one has made me so happy and feel so loved.</p>
<p>Gah, enough rambling. Life is good, enjoy every day you have and every person you meet.</p>
