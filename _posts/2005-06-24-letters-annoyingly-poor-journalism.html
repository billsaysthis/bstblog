<p>[<span style="font-style:italic;">I wrote this letter to the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/thepubliceditor/index.html">Public Editor</a> of the Times but their email server claims the <a href="mailto:public@nytimes.com">mail address</a> published on the guy's web page is invalid. Welcome to the 21st Century, right?</span>]</p>
<p>I'm writing not because of any partisan concern regarding today's article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/24/politics/24broadcast.html">Public Broadcasting Chief Is Named, Raising Concerns</a> but because it tipifies a failing in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> (and other major newspapers as well, to be sure): inserting a nearly new, though related, topic at the end of an article and not delivering the main dish of it. Specifically:<br />
<blockquote>In the floor debate, some Republicans continued to call for a trimmed-down public broadcasting budget. Representative Ginny Brown-Waite, Republican of Florida, said "Americans should be shocked" by how profitable the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is through its marketing of popular programs.</p></blockquote>
<p>That's a pretty significant assertion and one I haven't noticed any coverage of in other Times articles. Even if it has been, it's almost 90 degrees from the major point of the article. As a reader I expected to see the Next Page link where the reporter would add responses and elaboration of such a serious charge.</p>
<p>But no, the article ends in the next sentence with a cute mention of a Big Bird prop.</p>
