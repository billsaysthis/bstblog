<p>Just to be sure you readers understand this, I am a pretty happy guy and have been most of my life. This site may come across differently at times but that's for the same reason that news shows feature stories about death, destruction, and criminals--happy stuff doesn't give one much to write about. But I'm proud to say that <a href="http://www.crabapples.net/rob/archive/2002_07_21_default.htm#85285843">I won Rob's movieline of the week contest</a> this week, and happy that I did. Of course I used Google to <a>find the answer</a>, I didn't actually remember the Ah-nuld line. Still, a win is a win. And happiness is a good thing wherever you find it.</p>
