<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Jack and Bobby</span> is a decent TV show, with an interesting hook, but the scene that just ended is a strong example of why it's decent but not outstanding. Jack is at the doctor's office and begins chatting with a cute girl his own age. Who turns out to go to his school. Who sat behind him for last year's biology class. Who she is he has no clue. The dialog puts her at the opposite end of the social spectrum from him. The problem: she's far too cute and smart for Jack not to have noticed her, meaning the producers hired TV ugly and shined it on.<br /></p>
