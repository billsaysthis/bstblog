<div>One of the things I enjoy about watching English Premier League matches is the different jargon and language usage from over here. Phrases like on the trot and treating a club as plural. Another is seeing my beloved Liverpool win, which they did today, and not only was it their eighth straight league win but also the eighth without allowing the other team to score. Adding to the holiday joy of the Reds' 250th EPL victory was our defenders' total frustration of Michael Owen on his first visit to Anfield since joining Newcastle in August, not allowing Alan Shearer his 200th club goal and the continued improvement of Peter Crouch as the front man. Next up is the away derby to staggering Everton, in which I hope Rafa Benitez gives Djibrille Cisse a start over Fernando Morientes and/or Florent Sinema-Pongolle over Luis Garcia.</div>
