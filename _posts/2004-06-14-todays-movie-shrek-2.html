<p>Rack one up for the Sweet One, this was not a movie I would have chosen on my own. <a href="http://www.shrek2.com/">Shrek 2</a> is moderately amusing but nowhere near the revelation the original was. The whole scheming Fairy Godmother bit put me off though it drove the plot and I generally find Jennifer Saunders quite inventive. Eddi Murphy thumbs up, Mike Myers mostly good, Cameron Diaz okay, John Cleese walked through it. High quality animation is no longer anything more than the ante required to sit at the table--Katzenberg and company had better come up with much more for the <a href="http://comingsoon.net/news/shreknews.php?id=5114">third and fourth installments</a>. But my wife really enjoyed it and that's good enough for my Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p><em>mildly amusing</em></p>
