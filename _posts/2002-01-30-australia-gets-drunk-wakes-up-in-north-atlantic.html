<p>Humor is just a great thing. Not quite as good as sex with someone you love but hey. Check out SatireWire's <a href="http://www.satirewire.com/news/jan02/australia.shtml">Australia Gets Drunk, Wakes Up in North Atlantic</a> and you will be laughing for a damn long time.</p>
<p>And in other parts of the Commonwealth we can find completely different <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1789000/1789479.stm">unintentional examples</a> of the comic arts.</p>
