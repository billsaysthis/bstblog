<p>I'm pretty crap with predictions, except in gest, so I won't trouble you with a batch that are as likely as an elephant knocking on my second story door tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Instead, to all my friends, loved ones and readers, I will send my traditional wish:</p>
<p>May this coming year be the best of your life so far, and yet the least of all the many yet to come.</p>
<p>Thank you for your friendship, love or simple interest, all important and appreciated by me.</p>
