<p>However... here's one comment: Is <em>TV Guide</em> turning into TV Gossip? Nearly every issue over the last few months has featured an article that was worthless nattering and this week took the cover with speculation over how long the Simpson/Lachey marriage will last. The feature articles rarely rose above puffery--I've been reading or skimming for probably 35 years more or less regularly--but this is just sad and I'm glad the current subscription runs out in a few months.</p>
