<p>Wow, had this one sitting on the To Read shelf for three years, just kept passing&nbsp;the book by&nbsp;until it finally caught my attention the other day. Probably better than the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/italy/italy_tripbooks.phtml#vb3">first two</a>&nbsp;in the series, <a href="http://www.penguinputnam.com/static/packages/us/tomclancy/pointimpact.html">NetForce Point of Impact</a> is apparently the fifth title so I must have missed two somewhere. No biggie, <a href="http://www.dooyoo.co.uk/books_magazines/print_books/net_force_point_of_impact_tom_clancy/_review/308763/">short review</a> is more positive than I'd be but conveys the basics. Clancy's name and I suppose he participated in some brainstorming/editorial reviews but actual author Steve Perry is getting better as the books go on.</p>
<p><em>moderately interesting</em><br /></p>
