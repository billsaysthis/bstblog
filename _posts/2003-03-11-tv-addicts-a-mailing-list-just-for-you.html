<p>For the last couple of months I've been subscribed to <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RemotePatrol/">Tom Heald's Remote Patrol</a>. I get it as a daily newsletter but you can also read it on <a href="http://www.tvbarn.com/remote/index.html">TV Barn</a> or subscribe to the <a href="http://www.tvbarn.com/remote/index.rdf">RSS feed</a>. Oddly, even though the thing features Tom Heald's name in the title, it seems to be written by Jon Delfin.</p>
<p>Regardless of who does the writing, I like it. The newsletter/column is snarky and wacky, just the way I would do it. For example, sampling from today's installment:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Mysteries of Noah's Flood" (9 p.m., TLC) reveals that Ham just left the faucet on.</li>
<li>A Roman catapult is created by a team on "Building the Impossible" (10 p.m., TLC), and then snuck into Iraq to try to convince France to approve the current U.N. resolution.</li>
<li>"Wild Kingdom" (8 p.m., Animal Planet) suggests that meerkats aren't as sarcastic as Nathan Lane made them out to be in "The Lion King."</li>
</ul>
<p>If you watch more than two hours of TV a day and can spare three minutes for a bit of humor, read this regularly.</p>
