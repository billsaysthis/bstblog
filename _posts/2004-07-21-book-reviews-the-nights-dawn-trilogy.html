<p><a href="http://members.tripod.com/%7ENightsDawn/">Night's Dawn Trilogy</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_F._Hamilton">Peter F. Hamilton</a>: <em>Reality Disfunction</em>, <em>The Neutronium Alchemist</em> and <em>The Naked God</em>, each volume published in two parts in the US but originally one (each) in the UK.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.beowulf.org/overview/index.html">Beowulf cluster</a> named <a href="http://66.102.7.104/custom?q=cache:FYV--IZaL5oJ:home.hccnet.nl/j.m.heuft/+beowulf&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;ie=UTF-8" title="Unfortunately the original linked page is now offline so this goes to the Google cache">Night's Dawn</a>.</p>
<p>Possibly the best science fiction series of the 1990s, no kidding. You'd think that I would've read more of his work but no, never have. Rereading this every few years seems to be satisfactory.</p>
<p>An amazing story with the biggest scope one might imagine, 600 years in the future, Humanity spread across more than 800 star systems, friends with a few alien races, life is good for many though only great for a smaller number. Then the barrier between life and death is breached by some awesomely vile youths and everything is jeapordized.</p>
<p>Hamilton takes more than 3400 pages to tell his tale and I don't think he wasted a single one. There are wonderful passages of prose, technical inventions galore and characters that are realized and well-fit.</p>
<p><em>absolutely recommended</em></p>
