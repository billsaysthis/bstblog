<p><b>The Mirror Project</b></p>
<p>The web is spawning some interesting <a href="http://randompixel.com/">group projects</a>. Quite a few revolve around photography, including the Mirror Project, which "is a growing community of like-minded individuals who have photographed their likenesses in a variety of reflective surfaces." I was amused by the concept and had a <a href="http://www.mirrorproject.com/mirror/?id=2327">photo available</a>, so I decided to participate. There are <a href="http://www.mirrorproject.com/mirror/?id=22">quite</a> a <a href="http://www.mirrorproject.com/mirror/?id=174">few</a> interesting <a href="http://www.mirrorproject.com/mirror/?id=623">shots</a> and at least <a href="http://www.mirrorproject.com/mirror/?id=68">one to avoid</a> (just kidding, Marc).</p>
