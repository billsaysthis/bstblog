<p><b>$38 Million, plus or minus</b><br />

<p>Damn, that's a lot of money the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/news/2001/0817/1240961.html">NY Rangers are giving Eric Lindros</a>. And I guess it answers my question <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_08_12_blog_archive.phtml#5073282">How much is your brain worth?</a>. Lindros says that the lengthy time off--he hasn't played since May of last year--gave him enough time to recover from the series of concussions he's suffered over an eight year NHL career. Research is very unclear about whether time heals in this situation but they are very clear that concussions do cumulative damage to the brain. One of the holdups to this deal was the Rangers' ability to find insurance for the contract; I doubt it came cheap.</p>
