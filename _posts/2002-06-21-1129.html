<p>In the 70th minute, Brazil makes their first substitution, removing the offense of Ronaldo for an extra defensive midfielder, Edilson. England had subbed in Kieran Dyer for Trevor Sinclair five minutes before.</p>
<p>You wouldn't think England had the extra man the way the game has gone in the last 15 minutes. They've pushed too many long balls too far. Their shots are going high every time. Brazil is defending the corners or England is fouling before the ball comes in to end the opportunity. Time for another sub?</p>
<p>The game is stopped for a minute as Rivaldo recovers from a Sol Campbell finger in the eye. Rivlado is now tied with teammate Ronaldo and German sensation Klose for the tournament lead with five goals, by the way.</p>
<p>And Ronaldinho will miss the next game should his team win.</p>
