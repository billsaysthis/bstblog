<p>Back in the '70s teen chick rockers the Runaways almost pushed it over the top but, sadly all too common in the history of rock and roll, fell apart in a frenzy of intramural ego battles, drugs and external manipulation. Of all the members only Joan Jett really went on to realize her ambition and commercial success with Lita Ford managing a few hits. <a href="http://www.edgeplaythemovie.com/">Edgeplay</a> is a documentary made by Victory Tischler-Blue, better known as bass player #2 Vicki Blue, that takes an honest look back in surprising detail at what happened from the inside out.</p>
<p>The two biggest drawbacks are that Jett wouldn't participate and is heard only a few times on contemporaneous interview tapes and the other women, though clearly at times in physical proximity, never talk with each other (other than Blue's questions) in responce to sometimes startling revelations. Lesser evils are a general lack of performance footage and Runaways music as well as very strange interspersed comments from the very strange Svengali who put the group together, Kim Fowley.</p>
<p>On the plus side, putting <span style="font-style:italic;">Edgeplay</span> into the watchable column, the women are forthright in discussing the incidents and emotions which after all happened when they were between 14 and 20 years old. Drummer Sandy West tells us that during those years she was doing drugs and men to the point that after the band dissolved she was forced to become a mule and collector for dealers to support her habits, breaking down doors gun in hand. Original bassist Jackie Fox confirms longstanding rumors of a suicide attempt that sent her home early.</p>
<p>Lita Ford, still the hardbodied gorgeous blonde I remember from her late '80s/early '90s videos, comes across as less honest or perhaps simply remembers events from her own self-esteem supporting POV. I think the film's biggest miss is a conversation/confrontation between Ford and lead singer Cherie Currie, the second to leave after one too many feuds with the guitarist.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">recommended, barely</span></p>
