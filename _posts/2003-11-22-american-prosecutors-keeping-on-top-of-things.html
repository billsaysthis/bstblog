<p>What a load of crap: <a href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/031121/80/eemvv.html">Man gets "spam rage" over penis ad</a>. Prosecutors are charging a guy driven over the edge by illegal invasions of his computer while, I'm sure, doing nothing about the assholes who pushed him. But I'm thinking the official court papers or proceedings, should it come to that, will have to include identifying and contact information for the schmoes on the other end--they had to be the ones who contacted the US Attorneys, right?--at which point I think they'll find out from an outraged Net community that this was a poor decision on their part. But then I don't expect much in the way of brains from people who try to make money off messenger spam. And for sure if it wasn't after closing time Friday I would be putting in a call to San Francisco to give those lovely gentlemen in the Federal Office Building a not terribly polite word or two.
