<p><b>Someone actually published this book! Amazing! Funny!</b><br />

<p>I've never heard of a publisher called Writers Showcase Press (sounds like a vanity press from its name) but they've published Hiroyuki Nishigaki's opus <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0595094724/002-6171523-9541634">How to Good-Bye Depression : If You Constrict Anus 100 Times Everyday. Malarkey? or Effective Way?</a> This is just too hilarious. Sample quote: "Besides shooting out a big blank from your buttock, you can feel as if your root <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=chakra">chakra</a> leaked sweet hot mucus." His Amazon biography reads, in part: "A female inorganic ally gave the author the ability of space travel at age of 10 and 56. His first space travel was at the age of 56."</p>
