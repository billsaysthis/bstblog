<p><b>Lord of the Rings Media Kit</b><br />

<p>New Line Cinema has posted a really nice <a href="http://www.lordoftherings.net/media/pdf/cannes.pdf">LotR Media Kit</a> to the films' website based on the kit distributed during the recent Cannes Film Festival. Some good detail on the graphics and special effects work going into the trilogy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The American Prospect has a good article on <a href="http://www.prospect.org/print/V12/10/mooney-c.html">Tolkien scholarship</a> and the controversies it engenders today.</p>
