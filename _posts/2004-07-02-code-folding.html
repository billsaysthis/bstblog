<p>Reading through a recent <a href="http://www.idmcomp.com/dcforum/DCForumID2/324.html">feature request thread</a> in the UltraEdit forums, I saw repeated requests for Ian to add code folding. Guess my amateurness is showing but I couldn't understand what this is. Although I was getting an idea towards the end, I <a href="http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;q=code%20folding">googled the phrase</a> and found Matt Stephens' <a href="http://www.softwarereality.com/programming/codefolding.jsp">anti-folding rant</a> as the first result. Perhaps my coding efforts are not that complex but I agree with Matt--and I know at least one of my super coder buddies would too, especially:</p>
<p><em>If you're staring at your program and can't see the wood for the trees, code folding is the wrong answer. The answer is to structure your program better; encapsulate the details into different classes, use interfaces, small methods, and so on.</em></p>
<p>(Oh yeah, what is code folding then? The ability to designate a region--the MSFT term--of code and have the editor show or hide it as desired.)</p>
