<p><b>Work goes on, even when you're away</b>
<p>eWeek reports on <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/eweek/stories/general/0,11011,2709246,00.html">iPlanet efforts to woo developers</a>, specifically the new iPlanet Developer Pack and app server <a href="http://developer.iplanet.com/testdrive/testdrive_sp2.html">Test Drive</a>. The test drive was one of my major projects before beginning the leave I'm currently on. Having an evaluation version of the product easily available should help generate new business and not having it was a definite strike against us in competing with BEA.</p>
