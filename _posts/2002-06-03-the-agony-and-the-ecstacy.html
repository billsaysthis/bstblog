<p>They expect me to wait 57 freaking days for the <a href="http://robots.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Music/06/03/arts.us.springsteen.ap/index.html">new Springsteen album</a>? Someone up there either wants to drive me crazy or into serious agony! Shore Fire Media put out a press release today stating that a new Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band recording, The Rising, will be in stores on July 30. <a href="http://www.backstreets.com/news.html">Backstreets.com</a> has the track listing and some other tidbits; My City in Ruins will be on the disc but not 41 Shots. "The sound is very recognizable and very different," Springsteen said. "If you have all of our other records, you don't have this one. We picked up the level of intensity. I can't wait for people to hear this record." Gawd, this is going to be a long two months!</p>
