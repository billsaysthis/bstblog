<p><em>Bridge Over Troubled Water</em> has to be one of the most beautiful, uplifting songs written in the modern era. Art Garfunkle's voice just smoothly rising above a lovely piano part, <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/music/sandglyrics/bridge.htm">Paul Simon's lyrics</a> just offering the kind of warmth and brotherly love we all need from time to time. At the end, when the drums and voice are soaring, the reverb just reaches out and grabs at the heart. "If you need a friend I'm sailing right behind" may be simple words but a wonderful thing to be. One of my all-time favorites recordings.</p>
<p>The other night I was watching the duo's 1981 <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/music/sandglyrics/concert.htm">Concert In Central Park</a> on PBS and was reminded how much I enjoyed this music and when I went to Fry's this afternoon and saw this CD for $10.99 I couldn't resist! The new version of the CD adds a demo version of the title song, with slightly different lyrics, plus El Condor Pasa, The Boxer, and The Only Living Boy in New York. Softer than I usually like, really no electric guitars to be heard, but beautiful, terrific music.</p>
<p>In an sign I am getting older, both artists turned 60 last Fall. For those of you interested in answers to quite a lot of similar questions related to S&amp;G, either as a group, pre-S&amp;G fame, or as solo artists, I highly recommend the <a href="http://home.att.net/~sandg/faq/index.htm">Simon &amp; Garfunkel FAQ</a>, part of the <a href="http://home.att.net/~sandg/">The Simon &amp; Garfunkel Online Resource</a>.</p>
