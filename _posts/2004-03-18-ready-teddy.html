<p>I'm just a bit nervous this morning, normal pre-first day jitters nothing more, but the clock seems to be ticking very slowly just the same. I (want to?) blame Evan for not being willing to get up early enough to have a Morning Coffee Walk. I blame all the people in my RSS list for not writing enough last night to take my mind off things. Uggh, another half an hour until I have to leave to go one last time to a ProMatch general meeting and do the <del>perp walk</del>Success Story thing, then head over to the new office.</p>
<p>Speaking of <a href="http://www.promatch.org">ProMatch</a>, I recommend that any of you unemployed folks in the South Bay join. Although this job did not come directly out of the group, I think that the improvements in my resume and interviewing skills surely helped. Also, less tangible benefits such as getting myself out more, meeting people, being more open to what might come along resulted from participating. One of my goals in the near future is to keep my eyes open and see if I can help any of my new friends in their job hunt.</p>
<p>25 minutes...</p>
