<p>Two releases: <em>The Essential Bruce Springsteen</em> is a 3-CD set that has <a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/html_email/index_working.html#Essential">tracks from every record</a> The Boss has released over his career comes on 11/11 with one disc containing never before released and live tracks and <em>Live in Barcelona</em> is a <a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/html_email/index_working.html#Barcelona">two disc DVD</a> of his October, 2002 concert in the Spanish capital plus extra material including a Behind the Scenes feature is in stores a week later. Personally I'd prefer the DVD though the unreleased material is, of course, very tempting as well; I love his version of Jimmy Cliff's <em>Trapped</em>.</p>
