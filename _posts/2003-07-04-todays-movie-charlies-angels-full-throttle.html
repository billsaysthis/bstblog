<p>What a blast! This was a fun, wink at the audience, trash ourselves kind of movie with plenty of sexy bodies of both genders to fill out the slack. <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/charliesangelsfullthrottle/">Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle</a> has what it takes in a Summer movie, unlike, say <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_05_18_blog_archive.phtml#200313033">Matrix: Reloaded</a> or <em>The Hulk</em>: put the featured attractions on the screen and skip the rehash of Philosophy 201.</p>
<p>Sure most of the eye candy is barely-clothed women, especially the Angels and Bad Angel Demi Moore, but there are some hot guys; the script even uses Alex's (Drew Barrymore) predilection for bad guys to pick out targets. Terrific soundtrack, with a nice mix of current and classic tunes, lots of dancing especially from Natalie (Cameron Diaz), and an explanation of how Bernie Mac and Bill Murray came to be brother Bosley's. Eye twisting stunts but thankfully, except for some wire work, few special effects--there've been quite enough unnecessary impossible visions this Summer.</p>
<p>Best of all, writers John August and Cormac and Marianne Wibberly keep the plot simple and moving towards the climax. The few subplots, like Alex's inadequecies and assassin's target Max, are short and work to support the main story. Now don't get me wrong, <em>Full Throttle</em> isn't <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_04_27_blog_archive.phtml#200223356">literary quality</a> cinema, it's a <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_08_11_blog_archive.phtml#85335432">campy and fun</a>, get <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_07_28_blog_archive.phtml#85310078">out of the house</a> and enjoy a couple of hours movie.</p>
