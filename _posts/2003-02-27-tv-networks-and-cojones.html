<p>Lamont and Tonelli, the annoying new morning DJs on <a href="http://www.1077thebone.com/home.asp">107.7 The Bone</a>, were commenting on last night's <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/2020/Entertainment/2020_blake030225.html">interview of Robert Blake</a> by Barbara Walters. The allegedly funny duo made a joke that Blake would be starring in the next round of The Bachelor, of course with large and dangerous men incarcerated with him as the potential mates. Terrific joke. Still, they did make me think and I realized that as far as I know, none of the many dating shows currently on air (<a href="http://www.uni-television.com/BlindDate/index2.html">Blind Date</a>, <a href="http://www.mtv.com/onair/taildaters/">Taildaters</a>, whatever) has featured a same sex couple or competition. Why not have a gay version of <a href="http://www.1077thebone.com/home.asp">The Bachelorette</a>? I mean, I don't watch any of these shows, they're all just excruciating, but fair's fair. Somewhere around ten percent of Americans are gay or lesbian and why shouldn't they get a chunk of the humiliation TV is passing around to us heteros?</p>
