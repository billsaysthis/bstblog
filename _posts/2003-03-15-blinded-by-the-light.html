<p>CBS News asks <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/02/15/health/main540776.shtml">Was Atkins Right After All?</a> and gives a qualified ("so far...") yes as the answer. Reading the article, I asked myself if <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-02/acop-aco022403.php">these researchers</a> are today's equivalent of 19th century physicists, insisting on the unseen, undetectable ether even though all the evidence argued against them. As <a href="http://forum.lowcarber.org/member.php?s=&amp;action=getinfo&amp;userid=2">one poster</a> in the Active Low Carter Forums <a href="http://forum.lowcarber.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=87045">pointed out</a>, the establishment is stuck in a <a href="http://www.ee.scu.edu/eefac/healy/kuhn.html">Kuhnian</a> paradigm shift. Meanwhile, TS1 and I are losing weight and recent blood tests show good cholesterol results.</p>
