<p>Years have passed and the winds still blow<br />Memories of a sky choked with smoke will not fade<br />I can hear Art singing about troubled waters<br />Firemen still race up skyscraper stairs.</p>
<p>Tears still run down my cheeks<br />As families gather to hear their loved ones<br />Names read aloud--Ruth we miss your<br />Smile and wit, your always welcoming door.</p>
<p>Many more of us, humans of all kind, have<br />Gone from our companionship, gone from our<br />Company, but never gone from our hearts, their<br />Memories etched into our hearts.</p>
<p>Missions have been launched, lessons<br />Have been learned, but what has truly been<br />Accomplished? Six years gone and the dead are<br />Still dead, and terror still haunts the world.</p>
