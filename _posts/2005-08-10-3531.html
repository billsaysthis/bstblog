<p>I've never had the pleasure of meeting Anita Rowland but have enjoyed and respected her through her blog for the past few years--enough to keep reading her without an RSS feed ;)--so I was sad to read her <a href="http://www.anitarowland.com/gmarchives/00002212.html#comments">Bad News, Again</a> and find that her cancer's decided she needs another workout. So send your good thoughts and well wishes towards Seattle tonight.</p>
