<p>Some day I will get the hang of date arithmetic in PHP. Until then I'll be spending an extra hour or two for every class I try to create that needs it. In the end, I did triumph and create a new class that manages a countdown list of events such as the one in the right hand column on my main pag: bstCountdown. The events themselves are stored in a database table and filtered by list name (category). The code will be posted soon but I'm still working through an issue with a subclass. Take my word for it, this is very cool.</p>
