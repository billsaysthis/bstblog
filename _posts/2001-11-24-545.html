<p><strong>Call Noah, get the boat!</strong></p>
<p>Okay, so I may just not be used to big storms of any kind these days but the rain this morning is <em> heavy</em>! Coming down in proverbial buckets. Here, see if you believe me:</p>

<p>Do either of these show how nasty the weather is here in Mountain View this early Saturday morning? I wonder if the rain has anything to do with my not getting a <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/">paper</a> delivered. The forecast says the rain will stay fairly strong until afternoon, when we may get (oh joy) thunderstorms, with the precipitation petering out overnight--but then rain again Monday night and later in the week.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Well, it's 3:00 and the rain is still coming down, we had some thunder and lightening within the last half hour, but my house has floated away. Maybe it will still be here tomorrow.</p>
