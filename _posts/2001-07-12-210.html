<p><b>Cringely on the next wave of startups</b><br />

<p>I love Cringely. He wrote great stuff years ago at <a href="http://www.infoworld.com" title="I used to read this religiously but not for years">InfoWorld</a> but got canned after a fight with his editor. Then he wrote a <a>great book</a> and some cool PBS specials. Now he writes a weekly column on the PBS website. Recently (while I was in Italy) he wrote a very insightful column on <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20010614.html">why startups fail</a>. Biggest reason: founder and/or VC greed.</p>
<p>p.s. Cringely is a <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=pseudonym">pseudonym</a>.</p>
