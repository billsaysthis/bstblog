<p>The NY Times has an interesting article today, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/06/technology/circuits/06ADWA.html">Gnat or Parasite? Angst Over Adware</a>, which gives a pretty up to date and reasonable look at the state of spyware/adware. What I find so amusing is the quotes from executives of all the companies shoving this crap down our throats; none of <em>them</em> are doing anything bad or unwanted, it's always someone else. Of course!</p>
