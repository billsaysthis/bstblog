<p><a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/posts/02/20020814">garret</a> may be fourth for "greasy, grimey gopher guts" but I'm eight for something a lot weirder: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=2003+xxx+women+sex+men+photo">2003 xxx women sex men photo</a>. Especially because I don't have any sex photos on this website. Sorry. Especially to the guy who was searching in Arabic and came visiting here. I see lots of referals for restaurant searches (I come out first in Google for Bucca di Beppo Palo Alto, for example), George Carlin, Springsteen, and song lyrics and movie quotes. I'm #1 for <a>my own name</a>. All those are fine with me. Just keep your dirty <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=ar&amp;inlang=ar&amp;ie=windows-1256&amp;q=sexland&amp;btnG=ÈÍË+Google&amp;lr=">sexland.com searches</a> to yourself!</p>
