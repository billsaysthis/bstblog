<p>With MacWorld Expo coming soon (I have a pass and expect to get up there for one day), the fools at <a href="http://www.insanelygreattees.com/">Insanely Great Tees</a> put up a fun Jobs Keynote prediction contest which <a href="http://www.bureauofcommunication.com/sent/13008384">I entered in the humor category</a>. I welcome your puny attempts to outwit me!</p>
<p>TS1 and I are waiting to hear what the Reality Distorter actually does announce since she's up for a new computer, which will most likely be whatever ends up being the low end Apple laptop after the show. Will there be a sub-notebook/tablet, LED displays or just memory, speed and or battery upgrades?</p>
