<p>Just want to put this in for down the line. I saw <a href="http://www.mlsnet.com/games/04/tracker.php?gamename=04172004_DCMET&amp;version=pvp">Freddy Adu's goal</a> this afternoon, the first of his career in the 75th minute of the United/MetroStars matchup at the Meadowlands, and while the shot was fairly routine I remain impressed by his maturity, creativity and energy. Sure his team lost, 3-2, but he played well and made no obvious mistakes--I put he loss down to DC's backup keeper, Doug Warren, and poor central defense. Plus props to the MetroStars!</p>
