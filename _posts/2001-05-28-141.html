<p><b>Yesterday's Movie: Laughter on the 23rd Floor</b><br />

<p>Neil Simon has written some incredible plays and movies over the last 50 years, including The Odd Couple and The Sunshine Boys. In this made for Showtime film, Simon looks back at the <a href="http://sho.com/product/frame.cfm?titleid=110743">place he started</a>, working as a staff writer on the Sid Caesar TV shows of the 1950s. The reviews were pretty good but I was disappointed; the script couldn't decide whether to go for pathos over the booze and pills decline of the show's star and the amazing humor in the writers' room.</p>
