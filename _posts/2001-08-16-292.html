<p><b>Tonight's movie: Bait</b><br />

<p><a href="http://www.jamiefoxx.com/">Jamie Foxx</a> is stupid but he can run fast and, just when he needs it, he pulls some brains out of his back pocket in <a href="http://baitmovie.warnerbros.com/">Bait</a>. <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/nv/dmifc/index2.html">David Morse</a> is a hardass Treasury cop looking for <a href="http://www.doughutchison.com/">Doug Hutchinson</a> and using Foxx as, wow, a surprise, bait to get him. This is a sharp looking film and the plot almost holds together but inconsistencies like Foxx's varying level of <a href="http://jir.janes.com/">intelligence</a> make it hard to take.</p>
