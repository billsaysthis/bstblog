<p><strong>Football coaching merrygoround: Gruden to Tampa Bay?</strong></p>
<p>The Raiders get rooked once again, in their opinion, by biased NFL officiating and the next day <a href="http://msn.espn.go.com/nfl/news/2002/0121/1315059.html">Gruden rumors are flying</a>. A player (Pro Bowl db Ronde Barber?) and a draft pick from Tampa and Al Davis will rid himself of the hottest pro coach? Maybe, stranger things have happened. And this would give Al Davis a way to hire Denny Green, which (more) rumors say he wants to do. I still think, especially after Saturday's win over Green Bay, that the Bucs would be best served by waiting for Lovie Smith to become available. The latest <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/rumors/coaches.html">ESPN coaching rumors page</a> shows that Carolina has the most interesting list of candidates, mostly good assistants like John Fox, Marvin Lewis, and Ted Cottrell. San Diego, while considering run and gun god June Jones, is mainly looking at WWBs (washedup white boys).</p>
