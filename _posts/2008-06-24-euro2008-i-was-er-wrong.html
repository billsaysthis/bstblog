<p>The quarters are over and boy am I surprised! Three of the four group winners lost, with Spain surviving on a (thick) thread. Germany over Portugal was easy to understand as soon as the sides lined up for the pregame anthems, the Germans towering over Cristiano Ronaldo and crew. Turkey pulled another ridiculous comeback out of their asses, scoring on literally the last kick of the match.</p>
<p>Most annoying, the Dutch left their exciting, winning style in the dressing room and Russia did the business to move on. In all three group stage games the Orange were fast, aggressive and made their opponents look like B squads; Saturday Marco van Basten changed tactics and his players never really gelled with it. Russia could have been taken, particularly in the first half, but Sneijder, van der Vaart, Kuyt and van Nistlerooy just didn't have it.</p>
