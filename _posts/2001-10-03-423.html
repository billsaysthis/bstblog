<p><b>Holy Crapoli</b></p>
<p>Okay, maybe I'm just in a mood but those words were my exact reaction to Kay O'Connor in <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/134347570_woman29.html">Women's suffrage called 'mistake' by conservative Kansas politician</a>. O'Connor is a Kansas state senator but does not believe that women should need the right to vote. She is paraphrased in the article as saying "if men were doing their job of taking care of women and children, women wouldn't be required to vote." See what I mean? Then again, Kansas is the state where politicians decided that creationism rather than evolution should be taught in the state's public schools.</p>
