<p>I used to read and love every new Spenser novel <a href="http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,0_1000024618,00.html">Robert B. Parker</a> turned out--you remember Spenser, the characters and general mileau were the basis of the Robert Urich TV series <a href="http://television.aol.com/in2tv/spenser_for_hire_tv">Spenser: For Hire</a>--but after about 20 Parker seemed to get stuck in a going through the motions rut and I stopped reading. He finally realized it himself I think and decided to create two other characters so he'd have to keep the muscles stretching.</p>
<p>The tactic must have worked because <a href="http://bullets-and-beer.com/Bad.html">Bad Business</a> (2004) is definitely a return to form. This story throws our favorite PI into the middle of an Enron/WorldCom situation when the widow of a murdered top exec comes for help clearing her name. Turns out the books aren't the only thing cooking at Kinergy: there's also a free love party hosted by a radio love doctor to confuse the motives.</p>
<p>Parker makes a couple of glaring continuity errors but they were easy to forgive since I read these novels for the wordplay, especially the clash of Spenser's literary verbal style against expectations generated by his appearance and background. Also, his completely wonderful devotion to life partner Dr. Susan Silverman. Spenser gets the bad guy at the end, of course, but the ride there was fun.</p>
