<p>So does sleep beckon to you<br />
<br />In the middle of an afternoon,<br />
<br />Waving arms, wriggling fingers?<br />
<br />Almost jumping up and down to<br />
<br />Get your attention when Sleep<br />
<br />Realizes that so much action<br />
<br />Would simply drive you away.<br />
<br />What it wants is your REM cycles,<br />
<br />Energy from your dreams powered<br />
<br />By all that tossing and turning.<br />
<br />When you do wake up, still<br />
<br />Tired and the aches embedded<br />
<br />Deeper in your shoulders, chalk<br />
<br />It up to the demands of Sleep.</p>
