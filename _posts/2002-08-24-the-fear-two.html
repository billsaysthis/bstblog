<p>Jamie usually drove straight to the office but on the spur of the moment stopped at Starbucks for a triple Macchiato. The thought of dealing with those clowns decided it for him. The email he'd gotten that morning was typical, from another programmer who had an amazingly high opinion of himself, in that it showed a total lack of understanding of programming quality: "It does not make much sense to throw an exception just for the reason that you don't want to change code." How someone could be hired into a major computer company without understanding that throwing exceptions was the language designer's way of passing errors from one place to another was mystifying.</p>
<p>"Excuse me!" was what came in his ears just as he realized there was a really cute blonde woman in contact with his elbow. This was after his elbow had been in contact with her coffee cup and fairly concurrent with the coffee splashing out onto her sweater. Apparently the coffee was still really hot. "Owww" was the next sound. He cringed.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, just lost in thought," Jamie said, "but can I buy you a replacement?" She signalled her agreement before stomping off to the ladies room to try and repair the damage to her outfit.</p>
