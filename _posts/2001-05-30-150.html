<p><b>A place to relax or get snookered</b><br />

<p>IT online news source The Register has an update today on the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/28/19314.html">burgeoning Atlanta Gold Club case</a>. Management claims its simply an upscale place to relax and enjoy strippers; the US Attorney says, no, it's a front for mafia conmen. How does IT fit in? The defense attorneys claim a long list of famous customers, including Bill Gates plus such other outstanding Americans as Ted Turner and Michael Jordan. For those interested in cheking the scene and not living in Atlanta, the Gold Club also operates in <a href="http://www.goldclubsf.net/">San Francisco</a>, New York, New Orleans, and other cities.</p>
