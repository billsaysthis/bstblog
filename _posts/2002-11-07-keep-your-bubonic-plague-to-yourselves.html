<p><a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/posts/02/20021106">garret says</a> that "hantavirus and bubonic plague are things we live with every day" in New Mexico (in regards to the article I sent him) and my reply is: keep it in New Mexico, don't get on a plane to New York when you're infected. That's just sick.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> via email, garret explains that Bubonic plague and Hantavirus are both pretty common down his way, carried by the local insects, and usually treatable when caught early. Residents do need to be fairly careful with their pets; he has an on-going rodent problem and uses gloves to load mousetraps, a respirator when cleaning the garage. <em>Eek!</em></p>
