<p>No scoring in the first or third quarters, lots in the second and fourth. I have no explanation except perhaps in the third the players were still stunned by the halftime entertainment; I'm not just talking about the pasty on Janet's breast but the overall <em>who cares</em> of the whole show. For those of you expecting something creative with the ads, sorry, there weren't really any ads worth watching, much less writing about. Amusing <a href="http://www.sportsfilter.com/lockerroom/comments.cfm/423">in-game SportsFilter thread</a> though.</p>
