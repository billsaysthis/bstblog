<p>I lied, I'll tell you right now: I hate radio commercials for local car dealers that try to grab attention by starting off with that phrase in a very deep, serious voice. If that's the one thing I <span style="font-style:italic;">want</span> to know from the ad then you've written a poor ad and I'm not wasting 60 seconds of lifespan waiting to hear it.</p>
<p>Of course, that's not really the only selling point that ad will try and make. But since I've already decided your ad sucks the next tuner button's been pressed. Because I hate your ad.</p>
