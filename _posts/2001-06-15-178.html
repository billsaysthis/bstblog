<p><b>Entangling of macroscopic groups of atoms experimentally demonstrated</b><br />

<p>Well, if that isn't a mouthful, what is? This <a href="http://arstechnica.infopop.net/OpenTopic/page?q=Y&amp;a=tpc&amp;s=50009562&amp;f=174096756&amp;m=6270952202">link</a>, pointing to an <a href="http://www.arstechnica.com/">ars technica</a> article, one of the cooler amateur techie sites around, covers a report on a <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0106057">paper submitted to Nature</a>. As <a href="" title="Hi Hon-nay!">regular readers</a> have seen, quantum physics is probably my favorite topic outside of Star Trek. In this paper, Brian Julsgaard, Alexander Kozhekin and Eugene S. Polzik report that they have been able to experimentally show quantum mechanical entanglement between "two separate samples of atoms containing 10<sup>12</sup> atoms each". In plain English, a trillion atoms interacting for half a millisecond, which is far more, by several orders of magnitude, than any other researcher has previously achieved.</p>
