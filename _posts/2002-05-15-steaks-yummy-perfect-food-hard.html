<p>I love watching cooking shows, like Great Chefs and Molto Mario, but the Times article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/15/dining/15NONO.html">Cooking Like a 3-Star Chef in Your Own Home (Almost)</a> sets out the truth about what really goes into such top level cooking. Just not going to happen in a home kitchen, the equipment and the ingredients are too much. simple tip: cook hot and use extra butter. But hey, they also have the recipe for a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/15/dining/151NREX.html">perfect steak</a>, so it's cool.</p>
