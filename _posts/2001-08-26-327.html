<p><b>Tonight's movie: Down to Earth</b></p>
<p>Hit me with a big stick, this was one funny movie. I didn't expect to like it but someone decided to get it without asking me (and what's up with that?) so I went along with the thought. Damn if <a href="http://www.downtoearthmovie.com/flash/flash.html">Down To Earth</a> isn't funny, especially <a href="http://www.hbo.com/rock/">Chris Rock</a> and <a href="http://www.i5ive.com/article.cfm/male_celebrities/14196">Chazz Palminteri</a>. This is a superior update of the mid-70s <a href="http://www.seeing-stars.com/StarIndexes/WarrenBeatty.shtml">Warren Beatty</a> flick <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/click/movie-1009427/reviews.php?critic=all&amp;sortby=default&amp;page=1&amp;rid=9106">Heaven Can Wait</a>, which is fitting since Beatty co-wrote his version and Rock is credited for the same here. Brothers Chris and Paul Weitz show their usual strong touch with comedy--they directed American Pie (and <a href="http://www.foliesdegraduation2.com/">AP2</a>) and wrote Antz and Nutty Professor II.</p>
