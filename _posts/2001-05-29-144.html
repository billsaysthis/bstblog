<p><b>Today's Movies: Coyote Ugly, Finding Forrester</b><br />

<p>Take five gorgeous women and put them in a rowdy bar as the bartenders, with one as an <a href="http://www.piper-perabo.net/">innocent, aspiring songwriter</a> and you have the basics of <a href="http://video.go.com/coyoteugly/htmlsite.html">Coyote Ugly</a>. Lots of dancing by the 'Coyotes' on top of the bar and a sweet love story for the innocent songwriter and you have the rest. A fun, if predictable, movie with a nice cameo by John Goodman as a dad.</p>
<p>Gus Van Sant found a very profitable, critic-friendly story to tell in <a href="http://www.un-official.com/GWH/GWMain.html">Good Will Hunting</a> and it is hard to understand why he and the studio decided to tell it again in <a href="http://www.spe.sony.com/movies/findingforrester/">Finding Forrester</a>. Our protagonist (Matt Damon/Rob Brown) is buried in obscurity until found by an academic (Stellen Skarsgaard/unknown) and with the help of an outside tutor (Robin Williams/Sean Connery), finds his way to (at least the potential for) a successful life. Very Hollywood but done well both times. Matt Damon, the lead in Good Will Hunting, has a small role at the end in this one. GWH had a few more artistic touches (such as the Ben and Casey Affleck roles) and FF more closely hews to the Studio Rules.</p>
