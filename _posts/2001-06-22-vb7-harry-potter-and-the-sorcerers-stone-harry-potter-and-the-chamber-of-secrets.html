<p>What can I say? When I'm wrong, I'm wrong. I've avoided these books because I thought they were for kids, they generated so much hype, and they were fantasy. Well give <a href="http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/author/index.htm">J.K. Rowland</a> her due (and believe me, the money has been flowing freely) because she's written books that are just instant classics. The stories are like the best animated shows, they appeal to both kids and adults, there is broad use of humor, and our hero gets to eat a feast at the end.</p>
<p>         These are books every kid (say around age seven to nine) ought to read along with <a href="http://www.geocities.com/last_companion/hobbit.html">The Hobbit</a> and the <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/%7Etiktok/">Wizard of Oz</a> to put a spark of creativity, of the fantastic, in their minds.</p>
