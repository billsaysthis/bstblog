<p>Though the manufacturer claims it will only be sold to governments, <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,61616,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_9">New Gun Shoots Around Corners</a> will turn into another case which gun owners and <a href="http://www.nrablacklist.com/">the NRA</a> will push and push for their rights to bear one. As if we didn't have enough problems, now people will literally be able to shoot other people without even the tiny bit of visibility even a sniper has to show. How thrilling!</p>
