<p><b>TopFive today: Beer</b></p>
<p>Today's list is <a href="http://www.topfive.com/arcs/t5092101.shtml">The Top 16 Marketing Slogans for Dung-Flavored Beer</a>. It was inspired by the news that a new beverage on sale in the Orkney islands off northern Scotland is a "Stone Age" beer flavored with animal dung, recovered from a 5,000-year-old pub and brewery. I rarely log these even though the daily lists are usually pretty good but this one is too much. Sample:</p>
<p>14. It's *Still* Better Than Budweiser<br />
<br />7.  Tastes Like John Travolta's Acting</p>
<p>There are others funnier but also more scatalogical. Go see for yourself! Geez, I laughed more at the runner up and honorable mention lists than the top choices.</p>
