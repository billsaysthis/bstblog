<p><b>Zaphod: the anti-Dave</b></p>
<p>Dave Winer is an <a href="http:/www.scripting.com">interesting guy with a weblog</a> who is also Chairman and CEO of Userland Software, Inc. As with many people who write things worth reading, though, sometimes he crosses a line that pisses people off. As Dave has been <a href="http://scriptingnewsarchive.userland.com/1997/04/01">writing for years</a> he has pissed <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/webloggerusergroup/message/282">certain people</a> off, or at least amused them no end, so that some of them are now documenting Dave's follies (the folks behind <a href="http://winerlog.editthispage.com/">WinerLog</a>, led by the mysterious <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/guide/zaphod.shtml">Zaphod</a>, choose to remain anonymous for some reason). Even some <a href="http://tim.oreillynet.com/stories/storyReader$70">big</a> industry <a href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2000-09-11-010-21-OP-CY-DP">names</a> have had it up to here with him. I have to admit, I admire Dave most of the time but he can <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/webloggerusergroup/message/142">piss me off</a> as well; one telling point about Dave's attitude towards this topic is that even though he proclaims openness as majorly important, he shut down the discussion group associated with his weblog a long time ago. OTOH, WinerLog is hosted on EditThisPage.com, which is owned and operated by <a href="http://www.userland.com/">Userland Software, Inc</a>.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> The swell folks at WinerLog give BillSaysThis a <a href="http://winerlog.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$355">little love</a>, thanks guys. Only a few hours since their link to this article went live and a dozen hits already!</p>
