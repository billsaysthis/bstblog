<p><strong>Bill may be offline</strong></p>
<p>Due to stubborn or poor negotiators, the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2001/11/30/technology/excite/">AtHome network may shut down tonight</a> after a bankruptcy judge (the apparently not-so-wise Thomas Carlson) gave permission today. So while this site would be unaffected, since it's <a href="http://www.phpwebhosting.com">hosted independently</a> in Indianapolis, my personal access and therefore ability to update may be interrupted. ATT Broadband (my cable modem ISP) has promised that it has a backup solution in place but there could be a delay of a couple of days to a couple of weeks before I get back online. The judge has suggested that the contesting parties (ATT versus a bunch of creditors) ought to be able to manage to not shut off the service but why should they be able to do it? Who's representing the customer? Will Bill get screwed once again by his highspeed vendor (after getting left in the lurch by the Northpoint bankruptcy back in March and the inability--incompetence?--of Pac Bell in July)?</p>
