<p>Clearly, some people have more patience than others and certainly more than me. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have spent over 30 years and are just about ready to release <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/07/0723_020724_cuneiform.html">Sumerian Dictionary v1.0</a>. Lots of the source material, cuneiform tablets, comes from a boys' school and so not surprisingly mcuh of it concerns heroes and women's body parts. Still, I cannot imagine spending my entire career on a single project such as this but very cool that some people can.</p>
