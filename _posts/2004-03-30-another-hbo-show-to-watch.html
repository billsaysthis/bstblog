<p>I was going to take a pass on <a href="http://www.hbo.com/deadwood/">Deadwood</a>, at least until HBO repeats the run before the second season premieres, but curiosity and the great reviews got the better of me. After two episodes, I must report I'm intrigued and will be watching weekly. Don't know how HBO does it but they almost always hit the target dead center. Timothy Olyphant and Ian McShane really stand out but so many of the cast are making a meal of their characters.</p>
