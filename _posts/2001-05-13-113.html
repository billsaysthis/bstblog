<p><b>Today's Book: From a Changling Star</b><br />

<p>This is a cool <a href="http://www.starrigger.net/carvstre.htm#changeling">1988 novel</a> by Jeffrey A. Carver that includes nanotechnology, cosmic strings, and Machiavellian interstellar politics and is the first in the Starstream series. Very well plotted, beginning with the assasination of our hero and his escape from death but not from an almost complete memory loss. I'll definitely be reading the sequel Down the Stream of Stars. Carver has also posted an interesting essay entitled <a href="http://www.starrigger.net/Faith.htp">On Faith and the Difficulty of Writing"</a> on his site.</p>
