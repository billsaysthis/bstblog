<p><strong>Another reason to love the Internet: Informed debate</strong></p>
<p>Steven began the conversation with a <a href="http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2002/01/fog0000000148.shtml">post</a> on the US dollar, the money supply, and the dollar's status as global currency in respect to this <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A34226-2002Jan11.html">Washington Post article</a> on the Argentinian situation in which he (Steven) points out some scary future possibilities if certain trends continue. Russell Leslie, an informed Australian phycisist, started a discussion <a href="http://denbeste.nu/ubb-cgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f=1&amp;t=000546">M3 and other monetary aggregates</a> which was just great, going from monetary statistics to the benefits of a gold-based currency to <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=delineation">delineation</a> of the difference between the Keynesian and Austrian schools of economics. (Which comes down to a difference in goals, apparently.) Not mention the possibility of other to put commentary into <a href="http://andrewhofer.com.sabren.com/archives/000794.html">their own blogs</a>. Sort of what I'm doing here.</p>
