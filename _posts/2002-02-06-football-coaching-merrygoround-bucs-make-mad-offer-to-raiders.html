<p>The funhouse show continues in Tampa Bay as the owner's sons and their general manager, who was almost booted a couple of weeks ago when Parcells was on the way in, can't seem to agree on a new coach. Latest rumor is they have made an <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2002/0205/1323283.html">offer to the Raiders</a> for right to talk to Jon Gruden. A big offer. But old crank Al Davis has to take it by today or it's off the table. Then we have Ravens DC Marvin Lewis, the most discriminated gainst man in football (seriously), who is the first choice of GM Rich McKay; Lewis has no choice but to sit and twist in the wind publicly if he wants to break through the barrier. For sure he better not say anything impolitic. You have to figure this exemplifies the hidden reasons why the Bucs have never made it into the Super Bowl despite having had a quality team the last few years.</p>
