<p>I linked <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/1450204">this speech by Seymour Hersh</a> the other day but just now got to reading the transcript. You thought Abu Ghraib was bad but Hersh is a serious man with a serious track record going back over 30 years and when he says we haven't seen nearly the worst of it yet I cannot see a reason to disbelieve him. Read or watch it.</p>
