<p>One thing that I have tried to be mindful of for many years is just how fortunate I am. I have a good family and we all love each other very much. I have never wanted for food or material things, or a place to live; in fact, I've done quite well for all three of those. Not better than everyone but surely better than a very high percentage of all the human beings who've ever lived. I've known, and know, the happiness that the love of a good woman can bring. The simple pleasure of waking up in the morning next to someone who smiles back at you. I am thankful, today and all days.</p>
