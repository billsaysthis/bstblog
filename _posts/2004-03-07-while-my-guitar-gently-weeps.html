<p>Just got a chance to watch <a href="http://www.concertforgeorge.com/">Concert for George</a> via PBS (<a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_11_24_blog_archive.phtml#385731648">previous entry</a>). Some awesome performances from Clapton, McCartney, Jeff Lynne, Joe Brown (a musician from Liverpool who was just a little bigger than the Beatles back in the day, got to do <em>Here Comes The Sun</em> and lead all the rest in the closer, <em>I'll See You In My Dreams</em>) but I especially loved <em>My Sweet Lord</em> which featured Billy Preston on vocals and organ and Clapton on acoustic guitar before the rest of the band came in towards the end. Harrison's catalogue is like an iceberg and he suffered badly in comparison to his two much more famous badmates but he made plenty of gems too. If like me you're not oging to buy the CD or DVD, try and see if any accessible PBS station will be rebroadcasting this and dig it!</p>
