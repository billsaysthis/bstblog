<p>Yes, for thos of you keeping count, this was my third viewing of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120737">The Fellowship of the Ring</a> and I enjoyed it as much as the first two. What an incredible movie! I was able to focus on details that slipped by in my eagerness to see everything in the previews views. Jackson does some excellent foreshadowing and mirroring, for example. Aragorn/Boromir, Frodo/Sam, Frodo and Sam/Pippin and Merry, Aragorn/Uruk-Hai (more of this relationship in the next two films will provide lots of fireworks and excitement) are just some of the relationships Jackson highlights to give us depth of character. If you haven't seen it yet, get off your ass and go!</p>
