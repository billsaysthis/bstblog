<p>A modern variation on Catcher in the Rye, <a href="http://www.miramax.com/tadpole/">Tadpole</a> sets an upper west side Manhattan 15 year old boy on a Thanksgiving school break he'll never forget. Mature beyond his years, capable of discussing Voltaire in the original French and so worldweary he has no difficulty being served in a bar, Oscar Grubman (Aaron Stanford, who'll follow this up by playing Pyro in X-Men 2) has taken the train home from his Connecticut prep school to tell his stepmother Eve (the always alluring <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Weaver,%20Sigourney">Sigourney Weaver</a>) that his father (John Ritter) doesn't treat her well enough and he is in love with her. Hijinks, of course, ensue though this is not major studio teen romantic comedy.</p>
<p>No, in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0271219">Tadpole</a>, director/co-writer Gary Winick has created the latest intelligent independent comedy, a worthy follower to <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_06_23_blog_archive.phtml#85208240">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</a>. Stanford and Weaver are excellent, Ritter is a weak link, Bebe Neuwirth is luscious and lascivious as stepmom's best friend and even Robert Iler (Tony's son on the Sopranos) is quite good as the Grubber's best friend.</p>
<p>Note that although there is no nudity or blood splatter (well, no violence at all) and essentially no cursing, Tadpole deserves at least the PG-13 rating for it's sophisticated subject matter.</p>
<p>Another Dollar Movie Night excursion that more than paid off!</p>
<p><em>Definitely recommended</em></p>
