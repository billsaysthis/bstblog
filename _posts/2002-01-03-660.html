<p><strong>Elections do make a difference</strong></p>
<p>Columnist David Broder weighs in on President Bush's <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A49723-2002Jan1.html">Stealthy Pursuit of a Partisan Agenda</a>. Safe workplaces, using law enforcement to make points on a social agenda, gutting ghetto programs that make a difference. Thomas Friedman, writing in the NY Times, makes the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/02/opinion/02FRIE.html">same point from a different angle</a>. Important reads, this is precisely why I didn't want Bush elected. Thank you very much, Supreme Court Justices.</p>
