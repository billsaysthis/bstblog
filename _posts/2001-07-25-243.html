<p><b>Suicidal poet haiku</b><br />

<p>A <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml?type=humannews&amp;StoryID=133482">study led by James Pennebaker</a> and reported in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine claims that analysis of the poetry of writers who committed suicide gives clues about their eventual fate. Were their poems like this haiku?</p>
<p>When his necked snapped<br />
<br />Falling down from a great height<br />
<br />He sighed with relief</p>
<p>Is that too obvious? Well, that fanciful UK paper The Register <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/20703.html">weighs in on the research</a>.</p>
