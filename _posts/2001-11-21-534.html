<p>For the twelfth time since 1977, George Carlin brings his <a href="http://www.hbo.com/carlin/more.html">Complaints and Grievances</a> to HBO this week. After a humorous five minutes on 9/11, he blasts just about everyone in America. Guys named Todd (and Kyle), parents who put honor roll bumper stickers on their cars, and guys who fly hot air balloons around the world all qualify to have the sh$t beaten out of them, are missing chromosomes and ought to be thrown out of helicopters. Of course, it's all funny funny funny! The NRA are dickless lunatics--damn I love him! And don't miss this <a href="http://www.hbo.com/carlin/img/promo_graphic.jpg">wild caricature</a> of the man, it truly captures his wild irascibility.</p>
