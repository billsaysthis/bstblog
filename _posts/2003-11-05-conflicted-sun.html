<p>I realize that Sun's best path to profitability is selling as much hardware as possible, but the fact that they'd do a <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/031105/sfw062_1.html">press release</a> with Oracle exclaiming that Oracle's application set a performance record still strikes me as odd since Sun has its own application server. And from what my contacts inside Sun tell me, the managers of that product put no pressure on the developers to deliver performance, or even quality. Just release new versions on some picked from thin air schedule, or close to it, and upper levels are happy. One is tempted to agree with Merrill Lynch's Steve Milunivich that SUNW still has about 20% too many employees.</p>
<p><em>Later:</em> Just to add to the amusement over management at Sun regarding their expertise with software: the brand name for the enterprise software line is changing. Again. SunONE was only unveiled last year but in a flash of brilliance TPTB have decided to throw out that investment, just like they threw out the iPlanet brand the year before. Not sure exactly how the renaming will play out but <a href="http://www.idg.com.sg/idgwww.nsf/unidlookup/E2886EDA213E0A2C48256DD40020D0CC?OpenDocument">Java System Web Server</a> is the new name of the web server, so one would think that Java System Application Server will follow soon.</p>
