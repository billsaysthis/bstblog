<p><b>Rebuilding</b></p>
<p>This is the right idea, as far as I'm concerned. The Pentagon is jumping to it, with a <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?print=1&amp;guid={E4357572-9379-4EBD-B6AC-CB7A723F6E4A}&amp;siteid=myyahoo">contract awarded to rebuild</a> already (although I don't quite get why it will take 11 years). WTC landlord Larry Silverstein says <a href="http://cnnfn.cnn.com/2001/09/14/news/silverstein/">to help rebuilding the center</a> although not necessarily exact replicas. <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/comments.mefi/10277">Lot of debate</a> on the 'Net over the latter idea but I think the heart of the financial district is a place to have offices.</p>
