<p>Have you tried Dano yet? It's the beta of the new version of Blogger, available only to newly-created blogs at this point as far as I can tell. I created a new blog and the new version looks nice though some of the features one would hope to see, such as trackback and categories, aren't in it. The new UI is cleaner and more attractive and, given, a completely rewritten, re-architected code base, one can only hope the performance will be much improved too, curtailing the calls for help on the various mailing lists.</p>
