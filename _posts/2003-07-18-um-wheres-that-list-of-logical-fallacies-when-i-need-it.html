<p>Steven goes a bit off the reserve with <a href="http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2003/07/Tellingthetruth.shtml">today's brief post</a>: "You know, it's odd that no one is accusing Bush of lying about how brutal and vicious Saddam was." Of course, no one (at least in the US) disputed that Saddam was brutal and vicious, but then again that was not the given reason for the war. There are plenty of governments, indeed some of which the US supports, which are brutal and vicious but we're not pre-emptively invading them either. Steve, please, I know you've been sick lately but keep on track.</p>
