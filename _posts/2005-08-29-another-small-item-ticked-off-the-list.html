<p>One of the to-dos on my site redesign was to allow readers with JavaScript-enabled browsers to read book and movie reviews in place while allowing those without to click straight through to the blog archive page with the review. Win-win. Got that one last week.</p>
<p>However, what about readers with JavaScript turned on who want a real URL where they can come back and read the review again, directly? All the way down the food chain where the review gets pulled out of the Blogger database I don't know that I have access to the necessary information. Maybe yes, maybe no, but too hard to drill in through OPC (other people's code) and figure it out. So added a new page, singlepost.php, which calls into the same retrieval function as the review pages and gets (a ha!) the post text AND the post (book or movie) title. <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/singlepost.php?id=111095193944318669">Et voila</a>, to be fancy about it.</p>
<p>Still a few more edges to sand down but the finish line for this rev of the site is coming into view.</p>
