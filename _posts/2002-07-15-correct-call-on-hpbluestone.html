<p>Early last month I <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_06_02_blog_archive.phtml#85145449">commented</a> on HP's rumored plans to sell off their application server product line. They may yet find a sucker out there but don't bet on it. CNet News reports today that HP has <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-943905.html?tag=fd_top">formally announced the "retirement"</a> of this product line and plans to transition existing customers to BEA products. No one's going to pay for this, and I quote myself, "skanky ass software."</p>
