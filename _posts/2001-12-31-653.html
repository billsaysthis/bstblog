<p><strong>Naked Slashdotters, run scared now</strong></p>
<p>[Continuing the sex theme] Commander Taco, the man who launched a thousand flames, asks <a href="http:slashdot.org">Slashdotters</a> the <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/12/31/1456244&amp;mode=thread">question</a> "So for those of us who don't go "Out" for holidays and prefer sitting on our asses...What are you gonna do?" While he was mainly thinking of television marathons (and got mostly predictable results), some responses were quite frightening. As TomC <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=25487&amp;cid=2767980">says</a>, "The thought of slashdotters naked is frightening." One married poster is hopeful a Sex and the City marathon might lead to some for his own self, which leads one to wonder what kind of marriage he has.</p>
