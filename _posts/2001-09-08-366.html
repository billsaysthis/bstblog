<p><b>The problem of pleasure</b></p>
<p>Philosophers have for centuries (and ordinary folk for millenia) been wondering why, if there is a God, suffering exists in the world. Sin alone cannot be the answer since large events (such as hurricanes) can have the same effect on large groups, all of whom cannot have committed the same 'quantity' of sin. But the opposite question is rarely explored. Steven DenBeste, writing in his USS Clueless weblog says <a href="http://denbeste.nu/entries/00000658.shtml">pleasure is easily explained in mechanistic terms</a>: "We enjoy things because creatures who enjoy the right things are differentially better adapted to survive and breed. It's as simple as that." Read the whole essay, it's worth it. Steven was writing in response to <a href="http://www.seanmeade.blogspot.com/archives/2001_09_01_seanmeade_archive.html#5540984">Sean's post</a>, so I guess I'm just adding a link in the chain.</p>
