<p>This is the song, not yet released on any album, that <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/entertain/rating_bruce.phtml">Bruce Springsteen</a> played on the Tribute to Heroes special. Lyrics only: <a href="http://www.ametrano.net/bruce/mcorlyrics.html">My City Of Ruins</a>. If you have an MP3 of this, please let me know. According to <a href="http://www.backstreets.com/news.html">Backstreets</a>, a Springsteen fan magazine, this is the fourth time Bruce has performed the song, and though many viewers must have assumed the song was inspired by the tragedy, it was actually written about, and performed the three previous times in, Asbury Park, NJ. Springsteen debuted the song at the 2000 holiday shows in Asbury Park.</p>
