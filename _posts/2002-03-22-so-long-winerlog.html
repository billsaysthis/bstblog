<p>Zaphod and the gang are gone, apparently for good: <a href="http://winerlog.weblogger.com/">UserLand Frontier Server Error</a> is what you get when visiting the site. These nasty, somewhat anonymous folks had been punching holes in the <a href="http://scripting.com">self-loving one</a> for quite some time. Got old and repetitive for them, I was told, and so the site that sent me so much traffic is gone.</p>
