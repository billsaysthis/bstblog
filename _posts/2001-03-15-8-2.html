<p>The Big Dance just started, with Kentucky vs. Holy Cross late in the first half on the tube. I may be making an easy pick here, but I think the winner comes down to Duke or Stanford. Stanford beat Duke in the Bay Area back in December but having seen a little of Duke the last few weeks (including their awesome win over North Carolina in the ACC Final without Carlos Boozer), I think it's too early to pick between them.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> Kentucky won by four.</p>
