<p>Jerry Kindall is doing something I've wanted to do for years, <a href="http://www.jerrykindall.com/2005/08/13_laser_beard_removal.asp">permanent beard removal</a> using, in his case, Candela GentleLase laser process. Takes a few trips to the doctor to cover the entire face, since only actively growing follicles are killed each session, though the  result is what I want: to never shave again! Cool.</p>
