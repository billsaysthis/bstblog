<p><b>Yesterday's Book: Genesis Wave, Book Two</b><br />

<p>Star Trek novels continue to have a hold on me, as I await the fall debut of <a href="http://www.startrek.com/production/seriesv/default.asp">Enterprise</a>. In the <a href="http://www.psiphi.org/cgi/upc-db/0743411811.html">second half</a> of the story, <a href="http://www.sff.net/people/Vornholt/">John Vornholt</a> picks up where he <a href="http://www.psiphi.org/cgi/upc-db/074341182X.html">left us</a>. The Genesis Wave is blasting through the Alpha Quadrant and life on Earth is less than two days from the end. Picard, Data, and LaForge team up with Romulans, Klingons, and a finally awakened Carol Marcus, finally figure out the moss are the bad guys, and find the way to end the threat. (Of course they do, did you think this was the end of Star Trek and all the profitable publishing?) Oddly enough, the story seems to come to a complete resolution but the PsiPhi database lists a <a href="http://www.psiphi.org/cgi/upc-db/0743443756.html">Book Three</a> coming in January, but no description of what the story is.</p>
