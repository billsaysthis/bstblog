<p>Did Liverpool lose the Champions League today? Not unless amateur refereeing, headlined by Herbert Fandel, is the legitimate standard in this ultimate level of European club football. The first goal for the Rossoneri, just before half time, clearly came off the arm of Pippo Inzaghi yet was allowed to stand; even ESPN's Tommy Smith called it as the second coming of Maradona's Hand of God score in the '86 World Cup. And the German whistlebearer seemed to think every foul was on a red shirt, even when Gennaro Gattuso bundled under Harry Kewell after Kewell took possession, and he held off our last sub for nearly five minutes despite numerous stoppages when Arbeloa could have come on.</p>
<p>The Reds certainly had enough chances to score and went wide, high or soft and Milan made the most of the few which came their way. I have to question Rafa Benitez's decision to hold Peter Crouch until the 75th minute because our attack was completely different once the tall boy was in.</p>
<p>All in all, a good season for Liverpool Football Club. Third place in the Premier League and runners up in the Champions League by the skin of a bad officiating crew. The new American owners have promised a big stack of money for bringing in new players and I hope the squad will be big enough to challenge for both titles again next year.</p>
