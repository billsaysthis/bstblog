<p>I am such a curmudgeon! Even today means little to me except that we get craptastic repeats and <del>more</del>less on TV plus all the stores are closed; if I was working I'd be happy to have the days off and of course I don't begrudge others that pleasantry or their chance to worship the invisible man in the sky. Still, I was completely peeved <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/30395">to learn</a> that the National Park Service is caving to the Religious <del>Wackos</del>Right by allowing the display of three bronze plaques bearing biblical verses at the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>So I sent the following letter to <a href="mailto:gale_norton@ios.doi.gov">Gale Norton</a> (Secretary of the Department of the Interior), Deputy Director Donald Murphy (through his mouthpiece <a href="mailto:David_Barna@nps.gov">David Barna</a>) and <a href="mailto:GRCA_Superintendent@nps.gov">Joe Alston</a> (Superintendent of the Grand Canyon National Park) to express my thoughts:</p>
<p>I am writing to express my personal disgust at recent actions taken by your organization to approve the display of religious symbols and Bible verses, as well as zllow the sale of creationist books giving a non-evolutionary explanation for the Grand Canyon and other natural wonders within national parks.</p>
<p>I would like an explanation of how this does not violate the First Amendment in a huge way. And if the ACLU had not already done so, I would have been on the phone with them tomorrow to volunteer as lead plaintiff in such a legal action.</p>
