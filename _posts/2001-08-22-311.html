<p><b>An open source Clipper</b><br />

<p>You stumble around the web, looking for random things, and you find stuff you never expected. Just now I was looking up some old friends in Google and found the <a href="http://www.harbour-project.org/">Harbour Project</a>. Harbour is "a free software compiler for the xBase superset language often referred to as Clipper (the language that is implemented by the compiler CA-Clipper)." I made my living, and a good one at that, for the first half of the '90s developing Clipper applications for telecoms, pharmaceuticals, and insurance companies back East until the Windows surge became overwhelming and I moved, at management encouragement, to Visual Basic. But there are still people doing Clipper for a living in 2001, otherwise why this project, which appears to have a <a href="http://www.harbour-project.org/crew.htm">large number of participants</a>? Really surprising to me, but Computer Associates is still <a href="http://ca.com/products/descriptions/clipper.htm">maintaining and selling Clipper</a>! The web remains cool.</p>
