<p><b>Cute Joke: Husbands and headaches</b>
<p>A husband emerged from the bathroom naked and was climbing into bed  when his wife complained, as usual, "I have a headache." "Perfect" her husband said. "I was just in the bathroom powdering my penis with aspirin. You can take it orally or as a suppository,...it's up to you!"</p>
