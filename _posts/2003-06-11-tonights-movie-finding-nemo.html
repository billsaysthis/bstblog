<p>What a great film! So much fun and just beautiful animation. <a href="http://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/nemo/index.html">Finding Nemo</a> is a terrific addition to the Pixar list, possibly the best since their <a href="http://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/ts/tale.html">first</a> eight long years ago. Excellent casting of the voices, a range of different and interesting actors even in the supporting roles like Brad Garrett, Geoffrey Rush, and good old Bill Hunter Of course John Ratzenberger is in it, he's Pixar's so-called good luck charm. The software geeks over in Emeryville haven't been sleeping at their workstations either, as <em>Finding Nemo</em> has even better rendering than <em>Monsters Inc.</em>. The story itself is funny, creative, touching, and works on levels for both children and adults; we saw a weekday evening screening with only other adults in the audience and everyone was having a blast.</p>
<p><em>Absolutely recommended</em></p>
