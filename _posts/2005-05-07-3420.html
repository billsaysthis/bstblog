<p>So much for separation of Church and State, though not in the expected direction. Over in North Carolina, a <a href="http://newsobserver.com/news/ncwire_news/story/2378881p-8756854c.html">Baptist minister is excommunicating</a> members of his congregation who don't support George Bush. That's not only truly wild, it also violates federal law and the IRS should be showing up any day now to revoke the church's tax-exempt status. A good test case for political independence.
