<p>As if you didn't already know. You did, didn't you? Let's just say you did.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5ul7prwoiM&amp;eurl">Cocaine and self-cleaning toilets</a> are not a good combination even for hot blondes (YouTube video)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jewsrock.org/">Jew Rock</a> - while, despite the name, we can't claim Mr. Springsteen (he's Dutch/German) we do have--among many other--E Street drummer Max Weinberg, Bob Dylan and his sometime sideman Al Kooper, David Lee Roth, Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley of Kiss, Carol King and her early '60s songwriting partner Neil Diamond, country rocker/Texas gubernatorial candidate Kinky Friedman, glam rocker Marc Bolan, Clash guitarist Mick Jones and poet/folkie Leonard Cohen.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/">McSweeney's Internet Tendency</a> is a true web institution with enough funny bits to occupy a guy for an entire weekend, or week.</p>
<p>Still proving it has legs, but <a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/">Funny or Die</a> is a web startup co-founded by fellow USC alum Will Ferrell and Adam McKay (who wrote and directed the SNL star's hits <span style="font-style:italic;">Anchorman</span> and <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/movies/2007/06/talladega-nights-the-ballad-of-ricky-bobby">Talladega Nights</a>). This is probably why Ferrell gets sideline passes to Trojan football games and I do not.</p>
<p>Even the grey old NY Times tries to get in with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2007/12/10/arts/music/20071210_KUO_DYLAN.html">this MBA-style appraisal</a> by Andrew Kuo of Tod dHaynes' very strange recently released Dylan bio-pic <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368794/">I'm Not There</a>.</p>
<p>You can laugh now.</p>
