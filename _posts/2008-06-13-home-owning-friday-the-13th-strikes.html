<p>What a surprise! Our lovely new appliances arrived nice and early this morning and the wonderful, simply wonderful, past construction here raised yet another unbelievable annoyance: the cabinets next to where the refrigerator goes are not installed correctly so the fridge doesn't fit.</p>
<p>I'm talking to a <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/HomePageView?storeId=10051&amp;catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1">Home Depot</a> associate right now to see what can be done. A swap for the next size smaller? We'll see.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Later:</span> These guys treated me right. Though they apparently had no obligation to help me since the manufacturer refused to take the return (admittedly, per standard policy), the store manager agreed to do so. Plus he's letting us keep the first fridge until the new one comes Wednesday so we have a place to keep food cold. (It's sitting in the garage, fortunately for us located on the other side of the wall from the kitchen.)</p>
