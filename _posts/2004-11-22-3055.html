<p>Christopher Byron, a business reporter building quite a reputation in my eyes, has the kind of article in today's NY Post (<a href="http://www.nypost.com/business/34728.htm">Not So Fast, Eddie</a>) that you really want to see more often in more newspapers. Byron looks closely at Ed Lampert, an investor behind the emergence of KMart from its recent bankruptcy as well as the in-process merger of KMart and Sears. For starters, his hedge fund is the controlling investor in both companies. Anyway, sounds like some pretty shady dealing that I'm surprised to see in this post-Enron, Elliot Spitzer atmosphere. Maybe Byron's piece will open the relevant eyes.</p>
