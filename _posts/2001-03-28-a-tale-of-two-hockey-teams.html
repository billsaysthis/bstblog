<p>When the season started, only Colorado and St. Louis were better than the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/clubhouse?team=san">San Jose Sharks</a>, who are guaranteed their first over .500 season in franchise history, while defending Stanley Cup holders <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/clubhouse?team=njd">New Jersey</a> couldn't get out of the mud. In the last two months, though, the Devils made <a href="http://espn.go.com/abcsports/s/nhl/njdstreak.html">a run</a> at the all time win streak mark and the Sharks have been in a massive, 1-9-2-2, rut. The Sharks may fall out of the playoffs altogether unless they can get it together tonight against Los Angeles, while the Devils look strong to repeat as champs.</p>
