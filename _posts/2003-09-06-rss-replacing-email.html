<p>Lately there has been much commentary on the 'death of email' and such as people realize that spam and anti-virus filters are probably going to be less and less effective as time passes. Having read this, I have some questions for these commentators suggesting RSS as an alternative. Maybe John Robb, formerly an industry analyst and Navy jet pilot, can pose some answers since it was <a href="http://jrobb.mindplex.org/2003/09/05.html#a3599">his post</a> that inspired this.</p>
<p>I'm a bit confused by recent comments on using RSS in place of email. What I'm picturing as intended is an RSS feed that I publish to  instead of sending email. But I don't send all my emails to everyone, so that means publishing a separate feed for each individual and crossposting to the appropriate feeds when there's more than one recipient for a given message. I suppose I could use a single blog with multiple categories, one category per recipient but a) this is an implementation detail, b) categories wouldn't be very secure since one would would almost certainly use a mnemonic naming system, and c) Blogger doesn't support categories.</p>
<p>Anyway, this means that all my recipients would need to subscribe to the appropriate feed; perhaps I could send them an email with a link to get started? Also, each new person with whom I want to correspond would require much more initial effort than is currently required. Would the system use Trackback to maintain a conversational thread?</p>
<p>John? (or perhaps PhilR wants to comment?)</p>
