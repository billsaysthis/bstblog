<p>One of my hot buttons, I guess you'd say, is companies that attempt to hype their offerings in stupid ways. Case in point is this weekend's FX Network movie <a href="http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/redemption/main.html">Redemption</a>, an original production that tells the life story of Crips gang founder Stanley Williams. I don't know much about Williams beyond the bare facts and an apparently astonishing reformation after spending years on Death Row, but I do know that all the advertising (and even the one newspaper review I've seen so far) make a huge deal about Williams having been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
<p>Woopty fucking doo! Tons of people are nominated every year for that award and being nominated and $1.35 will get you a medium cup of coffee at Clocktower! Now perhaps Williams has come to understand how sad, bad and tragic his younger life was, how much harm he's done to other people in this world for so little good. Maybe he does regret all this and wants to spend his remaining years trying to put some good back into whatever he can.</p>
<p>But the FX executives ought to be ashamed of themselves for hyping the quality of this movie, or the story behind it, based on something as meaningless as this.</p>
