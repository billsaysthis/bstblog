<p>[A letter to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercury News</span>]</p>
<p>Gary Wallace (<a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/opinion/9848036.htm">letters, 10/6/4</a>) writes that John Kerry is a waffler who would let other nations dictate to America and instead would prefer the re-election of George Bush despite his faults. I would prefer a president who would tell us the truth and whose supporters and associates would also tell the truth.</p>
<p>Perhaps Wallace, for instance, could provide the facts behind his assertion that Kerry would defer to the UN since John Edwards last night explicitly stated that was not the case. Also last night, showing the stark contrast between our choices, Dick Cheney lied yet again on the subject of the Administration's assertion of substantive association between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda; NBC showed the evidence of this lie in their post-debate review with video of Cheney appearing a year ago on Meet the Press and saying exactly that.</p>
<p>There are more examples one could include but I would settle for just this one.</p>
