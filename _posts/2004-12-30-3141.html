<p>Now I think Amazon is to be commended for being the first (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/12/29.html#a9056">AFAIK</a>) commercial web site to open up a generally available, easy to use, right on the front page donate to tsunami victims functionality. I thought enough of this to actually use it. Since my finances are not what they would be if I were actually employed, TS1 and I agreed to use a gift certificate <span style="font-weight:bold;">from Amazon</span> that we recieved as a gift last week.</p>
<p>But nooooooo, Amazon is only set up to accept credit cards to pay for donations. I wrote to ask why, since they already actually have the money in their bank account that paid for the certificate but the only answer was "sorry we're not set up for that." How lame! Anybody want to <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/contact.phtml?sub=Buy%20Amazon%20GC">buy the certificate</a> (for face value) so I can have the cash to donate?<br /></p>
