<p>Cry: Republicans use their far deeper pockets to transform politics across the country, as described in this NY Times OpEd essay <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/23/opinion/23WRIG.html">from texas, coming soon to a statehouse near you.</a> [<em>via <a href="http://dangerousmeta.com/posts/03/20030523#j">garret</a></em>]</p>
<p>Wonder: Israel <a href="http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20030521-112245-2333r">broaches the idea</a> of joining the European Union, though this would be years away and only after a resolution of the Arabs' war against them.</p>
