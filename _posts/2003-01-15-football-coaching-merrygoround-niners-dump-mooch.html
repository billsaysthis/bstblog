<p>I <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_01_12_blog_archive.phtml#90178140">knew it</a>, I fucking knew it! <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/columns/ratto_ray/1493234.html">Mariucci was fighting a winless battle</a> and he was shown the door today by the 49ers! Regardless of his record the past two seasons, the disloyalty Steve Mariucci showed the organization last year combined with the ridiculous job he did against Tampa Bay Sunday was too much for ruling triad John York, Terry Donohue, and Bill Walsh swallowed the $2.25 million owed for the last year of his contract.</p>
<p>At the conference announcing the news, Donohue claimed the break point was Mariucci's demand to be named vice president of football operations--in other words, more control over the team--and this was not something the triad was willing to give. After hearing about this from reporters, the ex-coach said he was stunned and had never made such a request. In any case, he's free to head on down to Jacksonville for the only other current vacancy, no compensation owed to the 49ers. He might face some stiff competition for the job from Panthers defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio (an outstanding linebacker in his day at USC!) and Pittsburgh offensive coordinator Mike Mularky, both of whom would command less pay and ask for less control from an owner who wants to bring in a strong general manager after eight years of allowing Tom Coughlin to run everything.</p>
<p>Who will the Niners turn to? They claim to have no short list and will launch a thorough search but speculation is already focusing on Denny Green, who's probably had enough fishing by now, and current defensive coordinator Jim Mora Jr., who learned from one of the best, his dad. Wonder if he would bring Sr. in as DC if he gets the gig. Or maybe we'll see the third coming of Bill Walsh? Nah.</p>
<p>In a semi-related note, the Bengals announced Marvin Lewis as their new head coach. Lewis is the third African-American HC and the first Bengals coach not promoted from within in 23 years. He's long wanted, and deserved, a shot at running a team. But seriously, the Bengals? Are they actually an NFL team or just football's version of the <a href="http://www.harlemglobetrotters.com/news/faq_generals.php">Washington Generals</a>? Lewis will have to be a real wizard to reach even the six win plateau in Cincinnati. Given Lewis' defensive pedigree, could his hiring be a godsend for previously rumored to be a lock number one pick USC QB Carson Palmer? Will Lewis push for a potential defensive superstar instead? We'll find out April 26. The Washington Redskins, losing their DC for a fourth straight year, promoted linebacker coach George Edwards to replace Lewis.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0115.html">on this day 36 years ago</a>, the Green Bay Packers beat the Kansas City Chiefs in the first Super Bowl.</p>
