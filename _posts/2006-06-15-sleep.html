<p>I slept at the doctor's office last night. No, TS1 didn't give me the boot or anything like that! I've been tired in ways that simply can't be chalked up to not getting enough sleep, eating right or exercising, and it's been happening for a long time.</p>
<p>I first went to see the neurologist nearly two years ago. A technician gave me the equipment, and instructions, to do an at home diagnostic test and then a week with a CPAP machine but it didn't work for me, even at the end of the trial I couldn't sleep more than a couple of hours wearing the equipment. I started on a treatment for a different issue--which masked the sleep apnea--and put the idea aside.</p>
<p>But your body rarely lies and in time the issue came back so after some urging from my primary physician I went back. This time I insisted on meeting with the neurologist, not just a technician, and if nothing else she made more more comfortable and confident in the possibility CPAP could help. Plus the next alternative is nasty surgery to reduce the size of your tongue.</p>
<p>So last night I went to the clinic to try a new machine; this one uses distilled water to make the air easier on the intake and has a smaller, less intrusive mask about the size of a roll of quarters with two openings that fit over nostrils. What I didn't expect was to be wired up with 21 sensors but with the help of a couple of Ambien tablets went pretty much right to sleep.</p>
<p>The technician woke me up around 5:45. You can imagine my impatience as she slowly, carefully removed all the sensors. Most guys my age have a little something to do right after waking up, if you get my drift. The Ambien has a serious after kick, turns out, so it was a good thing that I was working at home today because right after lunch I fell asleep for most of the afternoon.</p>
<p>I don't get the results for four weeks. Keep our fingers crossed, okay?</p>
