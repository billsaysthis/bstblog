<p>[Note: I actually read this as a four part serial in <a href="http://www.analogsf.com">Analog</a>, the book version will be out in June]</p>
<p>Robert J. Sawyer has written a terrific story in <a href="http://www.sfwriter.com/exho.htm">Hominids</a>. Different experiments in quantum physics cause a connection to be formed between the Earths of two parallel universes: one quite similar to ours and one in which Neanderthals rather than Cro-Magnons persisted and developed into a technological society. One of the scientists from the Neanderthal's Earth, Ponter Boddit, is conveyed into ours to begin the tale. One might expect an X-Files or Men in Black story to unfold but actually the authority figures somehow stay out and allow private individuals to direct the activity; this is the reason I said "one quite similar to ours" since this would not be possible even in our Canada (the story takes place there).</p>
<p>The differences in the societies--not only do we get to see Ponter's view of us but the story alternates between our world and his--are well thought out but in many ways not too surprising. I think much of the author's depiction is based (as well it should be in <em>science</em> fiction) on extrapolations of current day anthropological theory with a nice mix-in of quantum theory. Which is a better hypothesis, Copenhagen or Many Worlds? Sawyer proposes a reasonable compromise that incorporates elements of  both in the guise of telling us Ponter's worldview. The scenes set in our world are mainly a chance for him to talk about society and some of it's ills and I am hardpressed to believe that the contrast drawn is intended to suggest a better way; all the action takes place in the other Earth as Ponter's loved ones try to determine what happened to him and to retrieve him. The writing is excellent and, at least at this length, the flow and movement keeps one's interest.</p>
<p>Sawyer has an <a href="http://www.sfwriter.com">excellent website</a> with just about anything one might want to know about him and his writing but one piece of missing information is any explanation of the difference between this serialized version and what will be published in the June hardcover edition. I doubt that the serial amounts to even half the word count of the novel. Still, don't want to fuss on this point since I did enjoy the read. Hominids is the first book of the Neanderthal Parallax trilogy so what I'll probably do is wait until 2004, when all three books ought to be out in paperback, and buy the lot then to read in one sitting.</p>
