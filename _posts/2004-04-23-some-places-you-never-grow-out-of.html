<p>The NY Times takes a look at the New Jersey town where I grew up: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/18/realestate/18LIVI.html">On Stagecoach Route, a Commuter Haven</a>. Interesting, hasn't changed as much as I would have guessed--still has six Jewish temples, for instance--but the home prices continue to rise. I guess kids look at the world differently but as a teen I never really thought I'd live anywhere else after college yet of the four homes I've owned, none was in Livingston.</p>
