<p>We're here in the new place. Pretty spacious, our big stuff seems to fit fine. Have to wait until the unpacking is done to judge the smaller things' fit. Though the kithen is bigger than at 67G, and the cabinet and drawer space looks bigger, the reality is not necessarily so. For now, until we spend some time and get to experience the neighbor noise levels I'm happy.</p>
<p>No word on LittleSteven from the PC hospital yet so I'm still using the craptastic Compaq. The keyboard and mouse are significant contributors to my namecalling along with annoyingly slow switching between applications. Could it be the insultingly small 256MB of memory? Probably.</p>
<p>Both of these seem trivial complaints in light of the horrors in London earlier today. We're just very glad the toll wasn't higher. Still, our lives are our lives and we move through minute by minute dealing more with what's at hand than across the world.</p>
