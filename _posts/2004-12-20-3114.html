<p>I can hardly think of a greater contrast, within the realm of very well-made American TV, than the two shows I just watched back to back. First was <a href="http://www.docmakeronline.com/heiferproject.html">Heifer</a>, a PBS documentary about a stunningly innovative charity called <a href="http://heifer.org/index.htm">Heifer International</a> which I recommend you consider any time you're in the giving mood. Second was the third season (series?) finale of HBO's <a href="http://www.hbo.com/thewire/">The Wire</a>. Some pretty serious similarities too.<br /></p>
