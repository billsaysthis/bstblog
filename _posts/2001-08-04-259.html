<p><b>Enterprise: Can this be true?</b><br />

<p>The folks at <a href="http://www.ironminds.com/index.shtml">Ironminds</a> tend to poke at things with an odd sense of humor. However, there are often nuggets of truth buried among the fascia. Can Rick Chandler's assertion in <a href="http://www.ironminds.com/ironminds/issues/010723/cafe.shtml">Exploring PlanetOut</a>, that all the characters of the new Star Trek series are gay, be true? Well, September 26 isn't that far off.</p>
<p>By the way, an excellent new commercial for the series has been digitized and posted, find out about the download sites at <a href="http://talk.trekweb.com/articles/2001/08/02/996793015.html">TrekWeb</a>.</p>
