<p>In the 66 minute, Landon Donovan put a terrific header into the net and the US up 2-0. Only a minute later it seemed like Mexico would have a penalty shot on a foul in the goal box against Luis Hernandez. Instead the yellow card went to Hernandez for taking a dive.</p>
<p>And the yellows are flying, five in the second half alone. The US took three in the first eight minutes of the second half and Blanco, Mexico's star, just got one for giving a knee to an American player trying to get up on his feet.</p>
