<p>Galen Gruman, a friend and classmate of mine, is the subject of Wired's article <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/wireless/0,1382,50407,00.html">What's a Wireless Editor to Do?</a> Galen was the editor of the <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/wireless/0,1382,50381,00.html">suddenly defunct M-Business magazine</a>, a CMP Media publication. My sister, who just got a new publishing gig herself (congats, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=mom70&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=joanne_dinner_mom70_10_01.jpg">Jo</a>), also got left in the lurch by this company when her Network VAR magazine was shut down a couple of years ago. Anyway, Galen was a pretty cool guy back in the school days and worked on some of the seminal VideoText projects back in the '80s. What a small world!</p>
