<p><b>Today's movie: Planet of the Apes</b><br />

<p>We were looking for some action, some chest pounding, screaming action today. And hoping a bunch of apes could deliver. Did they? You bet. Tim Burton has reimagined <a href="http://www.planetoftheapes.com/site_index.html">Planet of the Apes</a>, going back to Pierre Boulle's original novel and mostly ignoring the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0063442">cheesy Charleton Heston version</a>--although the main character is American, not French, and he travels in time, not to another star. Mark Wahlberg keeps pushing the memory of his days as a <a href="http://www.markwahlbergfan.com/ckad.htm">Calvin Klein underwear model</a> further and further into the dim recesses, Helena Bonham Carter shows the complexities of being an ape with a  conscious, and Tim Roth is positively <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=vicious">vicious</a> as the human-hating general. Is Burton making a movie about <a href="http://www.brothermalcolm.net/">racism and ignorance</a> or an action flick?</p>
<p>Did you know Boulle also wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0517207419/002-6171523-9541634">The Bridge over the River Kwai</a>, made into an excellent movie with Alec Guinness?</p>
