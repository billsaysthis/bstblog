<p>If you think I've got a typo in the post title, if you're seeing "Barcelona 1-2 Liverpool" then there is no typo. Just 90 minutes of atypically poor defense and confusion in the final third from the reigning European and Spanish champions who did indeed <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/6371395.stm">lose at home to my wonderful Reds</a> today in the first leg of their Round of 16 Champions League match.</p>
<p>Though the home side scored first with a good header from Deco off a cross by Gianlucca Zambrotta in the 14th minute and my guys looked to be mired in a swamp for the next 15-20 minutes, we persevered and took over the run of play for the least third of the half, with the payoff coming on a beautifully weighted cross from Zabi Alonso to Craig Bellamy left in space at the far post. Victor Valdes tried vainly to keep the ball from crossing completely over the line as he slid backwards into his own goal but only pushed it weakly to the feet of Dirk Kuyt, who tapped in for insurance, though the officials credited the equalizer to Bellamy's effort.</p>
<p>In the second half Frank Rijkaard tried to use his world class firepower to get the winner, bringing on Iniesta (who after all got the winner in the recent Spain-England friendly) and then Giuly in place of his two central midfielders and, towards the end, swapping a tired, frustrated Saviola for Eider Gudjonson, but this just put too many cooks on the field and did nothing to strengthen the questionable back line.</p>
<p>Of course my favorite Merseysider, John Arne Riise, pushed up as a fifth midfielder, was the one who blasted home the winning goal in the 74th. Dirk Kuyt got in alone at the center of Valdes' 18 yard box, neither centerback taking him on, and though the Barca keeper stopped our Dutchman, Rafa Marquez's header dropped right at the feet of Bellamy 16 yards out. Bellamy one touched to Riise, all alone at the other side of the box, and the Norwegian spun his powerful right leg to slam the ball in.</p>
<p>Even with four minutes of injury time and screams of the Nou Camp faithful the Spainards barely caused any work for Pepe Reina. I have to say, I was screaming at the end, in joy.</p>
<p>Bonus glee: I watched PSV Eindhoven defeat Arsenal 1-0 yesterday. There was no magic in Henry's boots and, as with Ronaldinho today, the world class star never really got into the game.</p>
<p>Second leg of this round is in two weeks. On March 6, if Liverpool get a win or draw, no matter the number of goals, or even lose 1-0 or 2-1, they will go through and Barcelona is done. GO REDS!!!</p>
