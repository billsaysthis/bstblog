<p>[Started this over two years ago and just found i lying in the dusty bins...]</p>
<p>The window in the shower in my bathroom<br />Looks out over a driveway high up and<br />Across the way to the matching windows<br />My neighbors' bathrooms but usually they're<br />Dark or closed and frosted, sometimes the<br />Wire mesh screen obscures the view</p>
<p>Hot water feels so good coursing over the top<br />Of my head, running down my back and legs<br />So many times I get lost in thought,<br />Far enough away from where I stand<br />To make me lose my place in the cleaning</p>
<p>Once, for three days in a row, one window<br />One floor down one apartment to the north<br />Was open and the light was on so I could<br />See into the bathroom from a high angle<br />But no one walked in, no naked body presented<br />Me with a stalker's thrill</p>
<p>My window brings in fresh air and cools<br />The Summer heat, offers a path for the air<br />To flow across the apartment instead of<br />Standing and dying in place but in<br />Winter all the windows are closed<br />Against the cold, but I shiver still.</p>
