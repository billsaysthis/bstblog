<p><b>Programming in tongues</b></p>
<p>Joey deVilla is building an interesting and impressive programming reference site called <a href="http://www.kode-fu.com/rosetta/index.html">The Rosetta Stone</a>. In this effort, deVilla is compiling a piece-by-piece cross-language reference for programming in C/C++/C#, Java, Python, Real Basic, Visual Basic and VB.NET. He has created conceptual sections (language overview, data types, loops, sting functions, and so forth) and for each section describes how each language implements the concept, with examples.</p>
<p>As a one person effort this is quite impressive. One wonders how much more comprehensive the reference could be if deVilla <a href="http://www.opencontent.org/">opened his work</a> to other contributors. Also, there are <a href="http://www.kode-fu.com/offline/rosetta2/data_types.html">nagging link errors</a> that should be fixed. Finally, one might quibble with the way in which the navigation hierarchy is implemented; opening one of the conceptual sections completely changes the left hand navigation menu instead of, say, adding the submenu for that section.</p>
<p>Still, deVilla is making an important contribution that can be very useful for programmers migrating from one language to another and to those working in multiple languages.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> In an email, Joey says he will be fixing the broken links this weekend and is working on a way to allow others to contribute to the project. As <a href="http://www.eurekanet.com/~suprphreke/ateam/hannibal.htm">the man</a> says, "I love it when a plan comes together!"</p>
