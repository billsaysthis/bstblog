<p><strong>Read my lips, part two</strong></p>
<p>Some years ago we had a president who said very publicly and emphatically "Read my lips, no new taxes." Then he had to take those big words back when it was obvious that taxes needed to be raised. Now his son has made a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml;jsessionid=ZSEOWDMZN5TKOCRBAEKSFEYKEEARMIWD?type=topnews&amp;StoryID=494344">painfully similar vow: over my dead body</a> will he allow new taxes or tax hikes. Will GWB end up on the same trash heap as GHWB?</p>
