<p>Don't you find it amusing that the Yankees, who asked for a forfeit of the first game of a scheduled doubleheader on Monday when the Devil Rays didn't arrive in time because of a hurricane (instantly denied) and then protested against having to have the doubleheader today instead, finally ended the mess when both of today's games were erased by rain? The teams have no more scheduled meetings this season after tomorrow though I doubt we'll see a tripleheader to catch up. The only day they can make up the missed game--assuming two can be played tomorrow--is the day after the end of the season and that'll only happen if the Yankees and Red Sox continue playing the way they have the last few weeks to make it meaningful.<br /></p>
