<p><b>Hornby on the Billboard Top Ten</b><br />

<p>Nick Hornby, author of favs <a href="http://www.salon.com/weekly/litchat961014.html">About a Boy</a> and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/arts/hornby.htm">High Fidelity</a>, looked at the gap between <a href="http://www.housing.wisc.edu/crc/people/bios/marshd.html">aging</a> rock <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/arts/hornby.htm">critics</a> and popular taste and cast a <a href="http://newyorker.com/THE_CRITICS/A_CRITIC_AT_LARGE/?010820crat_atlarge">critical eye</a> on the <a href="http://www.billboard.com/billboard/charts/bb200.jsp" title="Only current week's chart is available">Billboard Top Ten</a> (from July 28, 201) for The New Yorker magazine. One might get the impression that Hornby didn't care for much of the music or the lyrics of Staind, P. Diddy, D12 featuring Eminem, or even Melissa Etheridge but he certainly gives them a fair hearing.</p>
