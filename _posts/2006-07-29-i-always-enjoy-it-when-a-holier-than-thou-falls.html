<p>Mel Gibson, who earned a permanent spot on my blacklist with his hateful movie, got busted for drink driving in Malibu and then <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/439046p-369834c.html">cursed at the cops and, of course, blamed the Jews</a>. We're all out to get him, you see. Frankly I think his religious views and booze combined with the  megalomania natural to any huge star and the success of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/09/magazine/09GIBSON.html/partner/rssnyt?ex=1154318400&amp;en=3339f642d19fa0be&amp;ei=5070">Passion of the Christ</a> so that now Gibson thinks he's the Second Coming. At least after knocking back a few.</p>
