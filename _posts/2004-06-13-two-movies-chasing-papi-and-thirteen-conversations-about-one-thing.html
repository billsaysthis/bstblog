<p>Watched parts of both <a href="http://www.chasingpapi.com/">Chasing Papi</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268690/">Thirteen Conversations About One Thing</a> today but couldn't get my head into either; surprisingly both were efforts from women directors. The first was mainly about showing off <a href="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0323572/Ss/0323572/CP-41.jpg?path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Sanchez,%20Roselyn" title="This one photo captures the essence of the entire film">the feminine assets</a> of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0323572/Ss/0323572/E34-6.jpg?path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Sanchez,%20Roselyn">Roselyn Sanchez</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0323572/Ss/0323572/A5-21.jpg?path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Vergara,%20Sof%EDa">Sofia Vergara</a> (my favorite) and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0323572/Ss/0323572/G45-21.jpg?path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Velasquez,%20Jaci">Jaci Velasquez</a>. The latter was some kind of babble featuring Matthew McConaughey, John Turturro, Amy Irving, Alan Arkin and a boatload of others in a film that was all about talking and never about doing, as far as I could tell; I turned it off to watch this week's season premiere of <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/reno911/">Reno 911</a>.</p>
