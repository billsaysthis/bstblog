<p>If you have never eaten at this wonderful <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/entertain/pr_rests.phtml">restaurant</a>, do it. Do it soon! But go with a big group as the portions of food from the salad (the small Ceasar can feed 4-6 people easily) to the entrees (spaghetti and meatballs for six?) and even desserts (chocolate cannoli) are huge and served family style. Delicious but huge. I made the "mistake" of eating there last night with only one buddy. No room for a dessert course, strangely, but we did split a small Ceasar salad and the new Buca Per Due special of veal parmaggiano and baked maniccoti. Apparently it's part of <a href="http://www.bucadibeppo.com/">this chain</a>, with nearly 20 locations in California alone; other area locations include Campbell and San Francisco. <em>Yum!</em></p>
