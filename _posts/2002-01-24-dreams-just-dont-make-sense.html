<p>Ev's <a href="http://www.evhead.com/archives/2002_01_01_arch.asp#8984674">mention of a dream</a> today reminds me that I wanted to write up my own dream from my last sleep. Of course, several hours later, the details are beginning to slip away but.. I was in college, I think as a student again, and a group of 15 or 20 of us were taken hostage. Our keepers were quite brutal and harsh although I was fortunate (it was my dream, right?) to escape most of their anger. Towards the end, though, one of the bad men was focusing on a woman close to me, emotionally close, though not anyone I recognized from waking life, and I put myself in between them. The man spoke quite angrily to me, pushed a gun in my face and asked if I wanted to move. I didn't. He slapped me in the face with the gun and the woman jumped to me.</p>
<p>All of a sudden there was chaos, I heard gun shots and screaming. A rescue attempt. I jumped at the man who was menacing us, landing my head square in his stomach and knocking the wind out of him. We were near a door and I grabbed the woman's hand and we raced out. Didn't stop running for about five minutes when I was about to keel over. Some police came over to us and then I woke up. Didn't even stick around to find out how grateful the woman might have been.</p>
