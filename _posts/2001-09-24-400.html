<p><b>Jordan returns</b></p>
<p>While I might be referring to the Kingdom of Jordan's return to a place of respect for standing with America this week, I'm actually referring to Michael Jordan. MJ apparently <a href="http://msn.espn.go.com/nba/news/2001/0923/1254443.html">will announce today that he will return</a> to the court with the Washington Wizards, the hapless team of which he has been the president and part-owner since January 2000. I have no real idea if this is a <a href="http://msn.espn.go.com/nba/columns/may/1251908.html">good thing or not</a>, although it can hardly hurt a team that finished pretty much at the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/standings?season=2001&amp;group=league&amp;column=gamesBehind&amp;order=null&amp;seasontype=2">bottom of the pile</a> since <a href="http://nba.com/history/unseld_bio.html?_requestid=65024">Wes Unseld</a> retired, but some entertaining stats came out with the stories. The most interesting, IMO, is that Jordan has <em>scored more points</em> in his playing career to date than the combined total of all 16 current Wizards players, 35,265 to 34,391.</p>
