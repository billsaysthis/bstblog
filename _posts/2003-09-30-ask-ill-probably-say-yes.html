<p>Not being very skilled with photography, whenever kind words come in for my modest efforts I'm quite happy. So the call and email this afternoon asking for permission to use one of my <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=mv0901&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=flyinghigh_092101.jpg">photos</a> (from the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?pg=gall&amp;gall=mv0901">MV City Hall Post-9/11 Gallery</a>) was a definite pick-me-up. That the photo will (probably) be used as the background image on the title page on the upcoming State of the City Address by Mountain View Mayor Mike Kasperzak, a nice guy I met just this past weekend, makes it even better.</p>
