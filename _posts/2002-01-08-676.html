<p><strong>The words "oh" and "bugger" seem appropriate</strong></p>
<p>No, not the <a href="http://www.blackadder.com/information.htm">old school whisky</a>. I recorded <a href="http://www.blackadderhall.co.uk/specials/back_and_forth.htm">Blackadder Back and Forth</a> a few nights ago and got a great reminder of why <a href="http://www.rowanatkinson.org/">Rowan Atkinson</a> can be so funny. Except, of course when he plays the idiotic Mr. Bean. "A dung ball in a dress." "As thick as clotted cream." What great villainous language. Imagine Baldrick inventing a working time machine. If the PBS station or BBC America is broadcasting one of the four Blackadder series or one of the specials, catch it and laugh.<br /></p>
