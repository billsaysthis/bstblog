<p>Several weeks ago, the weblog of a Mr. John Robb, formerly of Userland, disappeared of the web. Not really, sites like Feedster had it cached, but the original site (Userland.com) had pulled off the pages and left an empty directory behind (<a href="http://jrobb.userland.com/">still there</a> as of this writing). Now JRobb, as I believe he prefers to be called, went out and found himself <a href="http://jrobb.mindplex.org/index.html">another site</a>--one he owns--and using the capabilities of his blogging tool, simply republished the back matter and started adding to it.</p>
<p>I was curious to see what his former partner, the volatile DaveW, would do when JRobb asked that people link to his new site. True to the rollercoaster nature of his personality, DaveW not only didn't link the new site (when the old one was given a lofty location in the blogroll) but he hasn't even mentioned the situation. Just seems to me that, having read DaveW's postings for several years and his frequent calls for friendship, forgiveness, and consideration of the good of the blogosphere over the personal, JRobb would have gotten some kind of mention.</p>
<p>Apparently not. <em>Bling!</em></p>
