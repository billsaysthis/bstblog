<p><strong>TV Alert:</strong> New <a href="www.bbcamerica.com">BBC America</a> drama from the creator of <em>Cracker</em>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/28/arts/television/28JAME.html?ex=1395810000&amp;en=1c80d365d9a41184&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">State of Play</a>, premiering Sunday, April 9.</p>
<p>They sure do things different down in Louisiana: <a href="http://www.2theadvocate.com/stories/032604/new_searches001.shtml">Warrantless searches OK'd, sometimes</a>. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, man those guys just suck.</p>
<p>Amuses me no end that the last two weekends have seen movies featuring the undead unseat that nasty Gibson flick on the top of the charts.</p>
<p>But speaking of service, this weekend was the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_04_13_blog_archive.phtml#200164260">annual call</a> from my mortgage broker. I didn't realize mortgage rates had gone back down again, after rising through the summer and fall, but she says I can go from five percent to 4.5% on a five year ARM and save nearly $100 a month. Still no cost to me, just have to turn in the past month's bank statements. Also restarts the clock on that five year countdown until the rate can change for the worse. If you live in the South Bay and want a referral to a great broker, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/contact.phtml?sub=Mortgage%20Broker%20referral">let me know</a>. <em>Nice!</em></p>
