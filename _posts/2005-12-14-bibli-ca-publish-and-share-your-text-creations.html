<p>My friend and co-worker Guy Tavor <a href="http://tavor.us/myway/2005/12/biblica-publish-and-share-your-text.html">has pushed</a> a new sharing site called <a href="http://bibli.ca">Bibli.ca</a> to the live web. On Bibli anyone can publish and share text creations, the same as one can share photos on Flickr or search on RawSugar. <a href="http://bibli.ca/users/billsaysthis">I added</a> a few of <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/poetry/poetryhome.phtml">my existing poems</a> to the site and it would be great to see more people get into this early. You can post any of your own writing, poems, stories, lyrics, essays, or anything that's public domain like some older texts Guy added such as Sun-Tzu's <a href="http://bibli.ca/creation/show/2">The Art of War</a>. Very cool look, very easy to use.</p>
