<p>Hard to pass up a movie with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/mptv/1235/Mptv/1235/1321_0109.jpg?path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Eleniak,%20Erika">Elena Eleniak</a> and another hottie (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0238914/">Julie Du Page</a>), late on a Sunday night with nothing much else on, and TiVo often knows what I like, so I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303758/fullcredits">Betrayal</a> (issued on DVD and cable as <em>Lady Jayne: Killer</em>). Sadly, Eleniak never so much as took off her shirt and Du Page only got down to her panties and bra once, early on.</p>
<p>This is certainly a 'B movie' and the kind of film that makes you wonder about the business judgement of film company executives; in any case, director Mark Lester has certainly made <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0504495/">a career</a> out of such decisions. Here we have a basic plot: mafia hitwoman (Du Page) has the chance to grab a briefcase holding $1 million, she does but somehow hooks up with Eleniak and teen son for a road trip to Texas, the mafioso and a corrupt cop find where they've headed and the day is saved, sort of, when FBI agent James Remar makes his play.</p>
<p><em>not recommended</em><br /></p>
