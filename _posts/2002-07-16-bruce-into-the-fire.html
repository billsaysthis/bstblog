<p>Country blues revving into a slow booming rocking country blues, simple chord pattern layered and layered, growing as <a href="http://demand1.stream.aol.com/ramgen/aol/us/aolmusic/artists/sony/brucespringsteen/aspli34399940987cthulufish_web.rm">the song</a> goes along. A meditation on someone who gave his all on 9/11. Between Bruce, Steve, and Nils, who's playing the acoustic slide guitar part? I'll be looking for this during the concert! When the electric guitar and other instruments join in after the first chorus, a chill ran down my spine. Of the three songs out so far, this could be my favorite; listened to it three times without stop. Check out these lyrics (or <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~maroen/engels/lyrics/intothef.htm">the entire song</a>):</p>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">May your strength give us strength<br />
<br />May your faith give us faith<br />
<br />May your hope give us hope<br />
<br />May your love bring us love</div>
<p>and</p>
<p><span style="margin-left:20px;">Then walked into the darkness of your smoky grave</span></p>
<p>Tallent's bass moves up the register to beautifully support Bruce's near yodel on the line "I need your kiss." Quibble: backing vocals mixed too high up.</p>
<p>Incredible, just why you love Bruce! Can't wait to listen to <em>Mary's Place</em> next Monday and the whole album in 15 days!</p>
