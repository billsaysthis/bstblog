<p><b>Linux guys need laughs too</b></p>
<p>Another case of a smartass with too much time on his hands--<a href="http://bofhcam.org/co-larters/">O'Really &amp; Associates</a>, a parody of <a href="http://www.ora.com/">O'Reilly &amp; Associates</a> with "computer book parodies, not much else." But they did make t-shirts out of some of the book covers and, me being easily amused, I ordered some.</p>
