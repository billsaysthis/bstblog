<p><b>Banner ads pushing into real usefulness</b><br />

<p>While I don't know how widespread this use is, I'm impressed (and a little surprised) that Ford is using web banner ads to promote their massive <a href="http://fordfirestonewildernessatprogram.ford.com/">Firestone tire recall program</a>. I saw the ad on a NandoTimes.com web page but since ads are generally rotated, making it impossible to point to it directly, I downloaded the ad and included it here. Bravo to Ford for not ignoring the web in this major safety program!</p>

<p><i>6/5 Update:</i> Ford is also running recall program ads on Yahoo, but this one is text only.</p>
