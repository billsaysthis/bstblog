<p>Congratulations to my new brother-in-law, Chris Brandenburg, on marrying into Vivian's family via her sister-in-law Vina. The bride was beautiful, the groom was handsome and the party was above average. I took <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?pg=gall&amp;gall=vinas_wedding">a few photos</a> and my only complaint is that her family lives far enough away that we don't see them often enough--that and a few of the more overused, cliched songs (*cough* <em>Always and Forever</em> *cough*) the otherwise decent DJ used. Have a great honeymoon in Hawaii!</p>
