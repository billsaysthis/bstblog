<p>I'm sure <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/05/tim_draper_musi.html">Tim Draper music video</a> is all that and a bag of potato chips but throwing around the claim that it was produced by a member of the Eagles, when in truth it was produced by the guy they hired to play drums while Don Henley preens upstage is not exactly the same thing. Even if you are a hugely successful venture capitalist.</p>
