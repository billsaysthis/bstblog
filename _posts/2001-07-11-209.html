<p><b>3 Billion Years and Turn the Lights Out</b><br />

<p>It's true. While the Universe may live on for billions of more years, our own beloved Milky Way will be destroyed in <i>only 3,000,000,000</i> years by colliding with nearby galaxy Andromeda. Astrophysicists Lars Hernquist and John Dubinski ran <a href="http://www.npaci.edu/online/v4.9/galaxies2.html">Galactic Collision Simulations</a> to see what it will look like. I can't wait to see it with my own eyes. Okay, eyes may be stretching the point, I'm sure I'll be using some advanced sensory technologies by then.</p>
