<p>"Over 150 Sun Partners Attest They Do More with Java Technology" is the title of a <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/030612/sfth028_1.html" title="Link may not work after 6/20/03">press release</a> issued today by Sun Microsystems. Attest? That's the best word the high paid flacks at Sun can come up with? Just a quick look at a <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/thesaurus">thesaurus</a> gives better choices like assert or testify. How do they sound to you: 'Over 150 Sun Partners Assert They Do More with Java Technology' or 'Over 150 Sun Partners Testify They Do More with Java Technology'. Either is much stronger.</p>
