<p>As in, "You can fool...": <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/03/business/03WATE.html?8hpib">Bottled Water Is Still Pure, but It's Not Simple Anymore</a>. Please tell me that none of you reading this page are foolish enough to believe that these waters are going to improve your health in anyway, other than the general benefit of drinking water. 64 ounces a day is the recommended amount of plain old water. These bulked up waters are just expensive snake oil, don't let yourself believe otherwise.</p>
