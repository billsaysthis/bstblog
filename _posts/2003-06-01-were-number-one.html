<p>Woohoo! America's goin' whoopass on every other country on the planet once again, and aren't you proud? We've <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/printedition/bal-te.journal01jun01.story">got more people locked up</a> in jails and prisons than any other country on the face of the Earth. Over two million total, over 700 per 100,000 population, beating out number two Russia which only locks up 655 per 100k--take that you stupid ex-commies! This is one piece of wonderful news that the Bushinations can't take credit for, since it's local and state politicians who've thrown the doors wide open over the years with additions like the Three Strikes laws.</p>
<p>We're number one! Hey! We're number one! Hey! We're number one! Hey!</p>
