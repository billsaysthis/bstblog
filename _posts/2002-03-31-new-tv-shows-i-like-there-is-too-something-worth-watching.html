<p>Enterprise - Great show, re-inventing the Star Trek universe while respecting tradition and what's gone before. Knowing they have seven years to fill, 175 episodes, Braga and the writing crew have spent time developing the characters and the backstory, while remembering they need to entertain every week. Bakula turned out to be a good choice for captain and most of the regulars are growing into their roles.</p>
<p>Alias - Sure Jennifer Garner has a pretty face but a I don't see her as the hottie everyone is screaming about. The show, though, really moves and the capers are dense, nary a wasted moment. The continuing thread of retrieving the writing and inventions of 15th century genius Marco Rambaldi is a strokeof originality that helps tie the weekly stories into a bigger whole. Plus the ongoing plot to unravel SD-6 and the Alliance, of course. Tingling!</p>
<p>The Agency - More spies, real ones this time, as we see how hands on the people who run the CIA really are. Okay, that's got to be totally unrealistic, for the head of the agency and his direct reports to be directly involved in most operations. Daniel Benzali and Gil Bellows really drive this show but I like most of the cast and fortunately for the writers (but unfortunately for us) they have plenty of topical material and the have the brains to use it well.</p>
<p>Jeremiah - Showtime's new science fiction series, Luke Perry and Malcolm Jamal Warner try and sort out life in a post-apocalyptic America with all six billion of the people over the age of 13 killed 15 years ago. J. Michael Straczynski has really done a good job thinking through the underlying story; this week's episode was a good example in the way the Burners introduction was handled, since I expect them to play a much larger role down the line.</p>
<p>Greg the Bunny - Seth Green, Eugene Levy, and a bunch of fabricated Americans put on a whacky PBS children's show. The Fox website, at least, sucks although the show doesn't.</p>
<p>Andy Richter Saves the Universe - An officeworker and his office buddies stumble through life with the ability to stop time and fantasize about love and violence plus our semi-hero conjures up imaginary people to criticize him. Good thing Andy Richter is funny and Irene Molloy is a dream.</p>
<p>The Shield - Sopranos meet NYPD Blue in Los Angeles. Stretching the boundaries of what is acceptable on a basic cable network in terms of language, nudity, and violence. Michael Chiklis was mediocre as The Commish and totally out of place as Daddio but so far he's totally coldhearted, scheming, and effective as Vic Mackey. His antagonist, the station's captain (Benito Martinez), is a little weak so far but hopefully the writers will figure out how to strengthen him without losing focus on his ambition.</p>
<p>The Job - A disappointingly short yet artistically successful second season wherein Dennis Leary unleashes an alcoholic, pill popping, adulterous detective on Manhattan with a strong ensemble of actors backing him up.</p>
<p>Six Feet Under - After a slow start last year, this show picked up steam about halfway through and is now really tops, focusing on a family that owns a mortuary and their close friends. Doesn't shy away from anything or any topic. Death, drugs, self-help quacks, prostitutes, gay sex, straight sex, underage sex, crime, and more death are all on the storyboard.</p>
