<p>Yes, it won or was nominated for a boatload of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327056/awards">the 2003 awards</a>. Even so, <a href="http://mysticrivermovie.warnerbros.com/index.php">Mystic River</a> is a decent movie. Not a great one, though, and I think the two Oscars to Penn and Robbins were more a result of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Academy_Awards_USA/2004">not so strong competition</a>; then again, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_12_14_blog_archive.phtml#107187423268071244">Return of the King</a> should have gotten more than the 11 Oscars it did.</p>
<p>Somewhat of a murder mystery, this film attempts to be more an exploration of what a tragic childhood event might mean to the lives--dare I say psyches?--of three boys from a blue collar Boston neighborhood, played as adults by Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon. The ending doesn't answer the core question all that well and I do wonder if Dennis Lehane's novel does it better, particularly since the screenplay was written by the less than stellar <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001338/">Brian Helgeland</a>.</p>
<p>Clint Eastwood directed, but does not appear onscreen, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000142/#director" title="As a director, that is">his oevre</a> is hit and miss. <span style="font-style:italic;">Unforgiven </span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Play Misty for Me</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</span> were terrific films but what about dreck like <span style="font-style:italic;">Space Cowboys</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rookie</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridges of Madison County</span>? I don't see much value added from his hands in this one. For instance, he uses a recurring motif of panning from the ground up to blank, generally grey sky. Wow, that's a psychovisual for you!</p>
<p>Still, my qualms are mainly in reaction to the abundance of awards and hyped reviews accorded to <span style="font-style:italic;">Mystic River</span> that I think are based on the original novel's reputation, Eastwood and Penn, and the topical, touching subject of the childhood tragedy instead of what's in the celluloid. I did like this movie.</p>
