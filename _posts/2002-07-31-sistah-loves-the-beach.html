<p>My sister Joanne loves the beach even more than I do. For the last few summers, she's gotten out of the New York City heat by taking a share in a beach house with friends. They've experimented with the Hamptons and the Jersey Shore but seem to have settled on Fire Island as the favorite. I've never been there myself but maybe one of these days...</p>
