<p>One of the primary architects of the Neocon movement controlling America today <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/16/opinion/16wolfowitz.html?ex=1253073600&amp;en=4dc3d29fd5a4ccf0&amp;amp;amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">takes Indonesia to task</a> over the prosecution of one of its citizens: "There are few powers that a democratic state possesses that are as awesome as the power to prosecute its own citizens lawfully. And few things are more threatening to a true democracy than the abuse of that prosecutorial power."</p>
<p>This is one of the same guys who believes the Federal government can hold American citizens in jail without charge or access to legal counsel.</p>
<p>(Mind you, I do agree with Wolfowitz's position in this case. I just think the man needs to use the same logic when doing his day job.)<br /></p>
