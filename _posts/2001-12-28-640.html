<p><strong>Snow</strong></p>
<p>Hmm, one of the reasons I moved to California was to get away from shoveling and the muck. But garret is out <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/posts/01/20011228">looking for snow</a>. Here's the advice I gave him, somewhat amended for weblogging:</p>
<p>1. Get in <a href="http://www.geocities.com/toml242001/">car</a>, start engine<br />
<br />2. Get on highway, head east on I-40 and I-44<br />
<br />3. Eventually, at I-70, turn north<br />
<br />4. At Buffalo, get off highway <a href="http://weather.yahoo.com/forecast/Buffalo_NY_US_f.html">if you can</a><br />
<br />5. Get out of car and look around at <a href="http://www.buffalonews.com/editorial/20011228/1001309.asp">72+ inches of snow</a>.<br /></p>
