<p>This was the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_02_17_blog_archive.phtml#9930590">sixth</a> or <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_01_13_blog_archive.phtml#8705468">seventh</a> time I've seen <a href="http://www.lordoftherings.net/film/trilogy/thefellowship.html">Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</a> though only the second time for the Extended Edition. The previous <em>EE</em> viewing suffered from a severe case of pause, rewind and review at the hands of my host (who will go unnamed but let's just say drives a real fancy sports car), while this one benefitted from being a lovely new print on a big screen at the <a href="http://www.metreon.com/">Sony Metreon</a> up in San Francisco.</p>
<p>We'll be up there again next Saturday for the Extended Edition of <em>The Two Towers</em>. This version of <em>FotR</em> is about 30 minutes longer than the original and, if your butt can stand the length, works better for me; not having seen <em>TTTee</em> yet, I'm definitely looking forward to finding out if that has the same quality with its extra 43 minutes. These are complex stories and characters JRR Tolkien gave us and, butt be damned, the extra time allows for more of that to come through.</p>
<p>What I'm really looking forward to is seeing <em>Return of the King</em> in 13 days, if not sooner, and then late next year getting a complete, deluxe, Extended Edition DVD set.</p>
