<p>Another piece I've written for the Intransa website: <a href="http://www.intransa.com/products/casestudies.html">Atempo Customer Success Story</a> (<a href="http://www.intransa.com/products/Atempo_cs061404.pdf">PDF</a>, <a href="http://www.intransa.com/products/casestudies.html">webpage</a>). This is the first of several such whitepapers I'm preparing. I also wrote, or substantially rewrote, all the datasheets linked on the lefthand side of the <a href="http://www.intransa.com/products/ipsan/index.html">IP SAN</a> page, and more of those will be posted soon. Plus a new design for the page hosting them so you can better understand what you're clicking.</p>
