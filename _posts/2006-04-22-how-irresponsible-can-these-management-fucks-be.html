<p>Taco Bell's new ads are pushing something they call the fourth meal. Yeah, another feeding time--between dinner and breakfast--because Americans aren't fat enough yet. This comes on top of their "I'm full" campaign bragging about how much food they can stuff into a cheap meal. The leadership of this company is simply sick!</p>
<p>Unless they put exercise machines next to the tables, the most suitable punishment for people like Bill Pearce, Taco Bell's Chief Marketing Officer, and David C. Novak, Chairman, CEO &amp; President of Taco Bell parent company YUM! Brands, Inc., is that they must eat 80% of their meals off the standard menu. Heck, I bet the company could make some serious cash webcasting the last meal of the week and that would be generating real shareholder value.</p>
