<p><b>Gone long</b></p>
<p>I've never been a big baseball fan, the game just moves too slowly for me. But having grown up in the post-Maris era, there is a special place in my heart for the guys with the big hammers. So hats off and a big cheer to Barry Bonds and <a href="http://giants.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/sf/news/sf_news_story.jsp?GXHC_gx_session_id_=b8d26794ec08ed18&amp;GXHC_servergroup=1073&amp;article_id=sf_20011005_bonds_news&amp;team_id=sf">his 72 homers</a>, which go nicely with the other two records he has smashed this season: 177 walks and .847 slugging percentage, both set by Babe Ruth. Bonds is 37 and you might think that Hank Aaron's career mark, 189 away at 755, is out of reach for him but Bonds is in the best shape of his playing career and, barring injury, four more seasons are not impossible. All in all, this has been a season for <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/2001/1005/1260081.html">breaking records</a>, with Rickey Henderson moving past Ty Cobb with 2,245 runs and past Babe Ruth's career walk mark. <a href="http://denbeste.nu/entries/00000955.shtml">USS Clueless says</a> Henderson is the greatest offensive player in the history of the game but I think we need to wait a few years and see how Bonds and McGuire finish their careers.</p>
