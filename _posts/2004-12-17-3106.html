<p>Very good news that the baby was found alive and apparently healthy but what really struck me as odd was the multiple uses of the word fetus to refer to a <a href="http://www.fox41.com/news/news_detail.asp?id=20162&amp;section=2">baby cut from her mother's womb</a> (of course killing the mother by doing so).</p>
