<p>Back when I was in high school, I don't know if there was a funnier movie or one I wanted to live in real life than <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077975/">Animal House</a>. John Belushi, with his awesome body language, eyebrows that had a life of their own, and nasty, witty dialog, set a standard with Bluto Blutarsky that as yet no college comedy has come close to matching. John Landis, Harold Ramis, Douglas Kenney and Chris Miller created amazing farces, characters and situations that just blew our minds.</p>
<p>That's the standard that <a href="http://www.oldschool-themovie.com/">Old School</a> is competing against and by that standard, fails. But if you want 90 minutes of laughs and aren't in the mood to watch Belushi and crew again, you might watch this anyway. Todd Phillips, who co-wrote and directed here, is developing a touch that continues to grow in the current <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335438/">Starsky and Hutch</a> and, one can hope, do even more in the upcoming Jim Carry version of <em>The Six Million Dollar Man</em>. Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn team up here with a display of behavior that tittilates and amuses. A boatload of hijinks and eye candy.</p>
