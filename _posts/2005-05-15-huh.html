<p>In the neverending, unwinnable war against spam I have no email address exposed on this site (as far as I remember) but instead offer a contact form. Very little comes through this and usually the messages are questions about movies or suggestions that I add someone's upcoming favorite. Occasionally though I get puzzlers, messages that I can make no sense of, not connected enough to any specific blog post to trigger understanding.</p>
<p>Such as one just now received, which the sender chose not to even supply an address to which I could reply. Here I quote in the entirety:</p>
<p>"its about some scum buying my club nothing else we will break this club so  we can buy it back and make it big again you watch"</p>
<p>Perhaps the author will see this and amplify. Possibly not and so I'll suffer to the ends of time.</p>
