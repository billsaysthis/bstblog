<p>Oy! Karl <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/weblog/kmartino/archives/004686.shtml">tagged me</a>, and like him I share too much so five things might be a little tough.
<ul>
<li>New people I meet always get the benefit of the doubt and will be treated as a friend unless and until they demonstrate they are not.</li>
<li>I hung out at the Mudd Club, CBGBs and a few other Manhattan punk clubs back in the late '70s with a buddy named Brian Karlman. During the winter months I was pretty much the only one wearing plaid lumberjack shirts and, no, I never dyed my hair.</li>
<li>I'm a big <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?P=amg&amp;sql=11:yi0xlf0e5cqq%7ET1">Buddy Rich</a> fan thanks to a <a href="http://amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A6FZZ43GZPF9J/ref=cm_aya_pdp_profile/002-6756309-1197626">good buddy</a> of mine from Jersey who was also an awesome drummer (and has perfect pitch to boot). Second and third favorite non-rock musicians are Beethoven and the King of Swing, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Goodman">Benny Goodman.</a></li>
<li>My biggest regret about living in California for nearly 11 years is still the distance from my parents, sister and my sister's family. But my biggest regret career-wise is not recognizing the opportunities in Silicon Valley when I visited here in my senior year of college for my cousin Larry's Bar Mitzvah.</li>
<li>Like <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/12/18/Five-Things">Sam</a>, I have an irrational fear of heights and also must have the aisle seat on planes and in theaters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there anyone left to tag? Well, <a href="http://rob.crabapples.net/">Rob</a> and <a href="http://www.pamslife.com/">Pam</a>, for sure, and <a href="http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/">Rogers</a>, <a href="http://www.danshafer.com">Dan</a> and <a href="http://kalsey.com/">Adam</a> make an even five, go to it folks.</p>
