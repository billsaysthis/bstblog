<blockquote><em>"President Bush will make certain that we are combating terrorism at the source, beyond our shores, so we can reduce the risk of having to confront it in the streets of New York. John Kerry's record of inconsistent positions on combating terrorism gives us no confidence he'll pursue such a determined course." -- Rudy Guiliani at the 2004 RNC</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So, Rudy, you're saying that George Bush, a man with zero foreign policy or defense experience before becoming (I won't say 'elected') President should have been given the benefit of the doubt when he was a candidate but John Kerry, a man who has actually served his country in a war, should not. Set aside the eighteen years of dealing with national issues in the Senate, because those don't count either.</p>
<p>Rudy, I know you're a Republican and one who has a lot of political capital, but don't go down that Swift Boad river! </p>
<p><em>Later:</em> Garret went off on Guiliani (and McCain) in <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/?p=4420">far greater detail</a>.</p>
