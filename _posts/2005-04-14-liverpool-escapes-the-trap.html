<p>Full-time Report: <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=180738&amp;cc=5901">Juventus 0 - 0 Liverpool</a>. Liverpool played to a scoreless draw at Juventus in the second game of their home and home Champions League series without Steven Gerrard but with the surprise early returns of Xabi Alonso and Djibrille Cisse from injury. Since they won the first game last week 2-1, the Reds make it to the Final Four. Of course, the competition doesn't get any easier because the next opponent is Chelsea (best team in the EPL by far this season) in two weeks and then the week after, the day before my birthday--what a wonderful birthday present winning this match up would be! But W00T for today, because almost nobody expected us to come home from Italy with this result.</p>
