<p><strong>Death of the West</strong></p>
<p>Sounds kind of Lord of the Rings-ish, but Patrick Buchanan is <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/mattpjb.htm">writing about us</a> in his new <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=polemic">polemic</a>. His new book "contends that the U.S. will be a Third World nation by the year 2050 [and...] predicts Europe will be inundated by an Islamic-Arab-African invasion and most First World nations, including Japan, will have begun slowly to vanish from the earth." Lots of demographics to back him up but then we get to the crux of his explanation:</p>
<p>"Buchanan argues that the death of the Christian faith in Western countries is a primary cause of their dying populations. Whenever faith dies, the people die. A new atheistic civilization is arising, he argues, and is using its dominance of the culture and the courts to drive Christianity out of the temples of our civilization."</p>
