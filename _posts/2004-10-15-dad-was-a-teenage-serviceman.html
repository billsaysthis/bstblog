<p>There's an interesting story behind the fact that my dad was in both <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=family2&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=1dad_germany3.jpg">the Army</a> and <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=family2&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=1dad_navyuniform.jpg">the Navy</a> (one stint in each, not overlapping). [When I talk to him next I'll try and get the facts straight to post here.]<br /></p>
