<p>Gotta love FoxSportsWorld for bringing every game of the ChampionsWorld Series to us live and in repeats. So far there's been three matches and I've watched them all. Chelsea over Celtic 4-2 on Saturday was a good game where you could see some of Roman's millions paying off and a good young Celtic striker trying to show he can be the man with the departure of longtime star Henrik Larrson to Barcelona. Manchester United and Bayern Munich was less of a game than 90 minutes of kicking the ball up and down the field, though I blame the Germans since they had a real team on the pitch and not a bunch of teenagers; expect Sir Alex to have a very different lineup Wednesday when the Red Devils take on Celtic.</p>
<p>But the real joy for me was this afternoon, getting home just in time to see my beloved LFC take on (yes, they're playing a lot) Celtic. What a blast, five goals against a supposedly quality opposition.</p>
<p>True, Celtic had plenty of youngsters on the field, including a 19 year old in goal, but most of the Reds' scores would have just as likely gone in against regular keeper Marcus Hedberg as well. Our goal was kept by Chris Kirkland and he only had to make one real save the entire match--the only ball he let in was a fairly tough PK from that terrific young striker (Craig Beattie). Kirkland has a lot to show if he wants to keep the starting spot over Jerzy Dudek after missing most of the last two years from injury, perhaps Rafa is giving him that time on this tour.</p>
<p>The first two scores came early from my favorite players, John Arne Riise and Michael Owen, the first on a 30 yard free kick Riise blast and the second a 40 yard beautiful through ball over the defensemen's heads from Riise to Owen who lobbed it over Marshall on one touch. The Scots never really got any offense going in the first half, with commentator Giorgio Chinaglia constantly calling for them to pick up the pace.</p>
<p>Wholesale changes for LFC to begin the second half, except for (continuing disappointment) Harry Kewell the whole front side changed out. Cisse and Pongolle took over up front, Murphy, Gerrard and Salif Diao came on in the middle. Henchoz replaced Hyppia in the back. And there was no let up in the pressure and pace, Cisse banged a ball off the far post inside of 90 seconds and did score minutes later on a give and go from Danny Murphy. Henchoz got the fourth when Celtic forgot to mark in the box on a corner and Cisse finished the matter with another off a Murphy cross from the right.</p>
<p>Don't want to put too much weight into two exhibition matches but I like what 'Pool has shown so far. Two more matches on this side of the water and then home for the 14 August season opener and Champions League qualifiers. Benitez was up and directing play right to the end, according to Chinaglia, and that has to be good.</p>
<p>The leavers who are no loss: Emile Heskey, Markus Babbel, Bruno Cheyrou (loan), El Hadji Diouf (probable) and Anthony Le Tallec (loan). Heskey is muscular but not a speed man and was never able to convert his physicality into enough goals; Diouf couldn't even push Heskey off the field for playing time and is simply not suited to the wing where he got most of his playing time last season. Cheyrou showed a few sparks last year but at 25 is getting too old to break into the first team. Babbel was simply surplus and Le Tallec wasn't going to get enough playing time this season and at 19 years old needs it to continue growing into his potential.</p>
<p>In: Djibril Cisse, Josemi (Jose Miguel Gonzalez Rey). Cisse showed tonight he will give Milan Baros a hard time for the 'other' forward spot. Baros, mind you, played quite well in the first half but hard to argue with two goals and two near-misses. Florent Sinama Pongolle also showed he is more useful than Le Tallec, Diouf or Heskey and will spell the first three as needed. The Reds will have an awesome strike force if these four stay healthy! Josemi is an unknown quantity, not quite signed yet, but presumably is slated to partner Hyppia in central defense; where this leaves Stephan Henchoz I'm not sure.</p>
<p>So let's consider a potential regular 4-4-2 starting squad:</p>
<p>Goalkeeper: Kirkland, at least for now<br />
<br />Center Defense: Hyppia and Josemi, with Igor Biscan as primary sub<br />
<br />Fullbacks: Riise and Finnan, though I'm not that impressed with Finnan and could see Jamie Carragher getting plenty of play, and Djimi Traore may push as well<br />
<br />Defensive midfielder: Dieter Hamman<br />
<br />Center midfield: Steven Gerrard<br />
<br />Left wing: Harry Kewell<br />
<br />Right wing: Danny Murphy<br />
<br />Strikers: Owen and Cisse, though Baros may yet leave because of it</p>
<p>Some players who seem to have outlived their usefulness: Salif Diao, like fellow Senegalese natinal teamer Diouf, was possibly the least of the team tonightnor does&nbsp;Vladimir Smicer do anything for me. I could also easily see Kewell going, perhaps in the January transfer window if his play doesn't improve. Riise was a winger earlier in his Anfield days, still has pace and excellent passing skills, and I'd love to see him getting a chance on the left with young Jon Otsemboor coming on in the back.</p>
<p>A word of caution: even though this team looks to break out of the gate and has firepower to score many goals, the competition at the top of the EPL will be as stiff as last year, with all the other clubs except Arsenal making significant signings and since the Gunners were of course undefeated in the last campaign, why would they? Could be a very scary year all around&nbsp;with injuries and career years determining the final standings.</p>
