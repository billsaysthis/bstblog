<p>"The opening stages of the disarmament of the Iraqi regime have begun. The President will address the nation at 10:15." With those few words, 105 minutes after the deadline, Ari Fleischer told the nation, and the world, that the coalition of the willing have begun the attacks to separate Saddam Hussein from this mortal coil.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Apparently the target of opportunity was Hussein himself and would that be a massive stroke of good fortune if he was taken out of play with one shot. Somehow I doubt the fates will allow such an easy win.</p>
