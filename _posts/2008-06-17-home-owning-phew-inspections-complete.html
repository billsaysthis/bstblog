<p>To say we had a little trouble with the Mountain View Building Department would be an understatement. Most knowledgeable folks I spoke with couldn't understand why we needed to take out any permits, much less two. (Late in the game we had to get a third, for the new furnace, though that does seem justified).</p>
<p>Fortunately we had good people working for us and so when the inspector came out this morning he signed off on all three.</p>
<p>The disconnect stems from the fact that all the work we did was to repair or correct existing things, all of which should have been inspected two or three years ago when the previous owner expanded and remodeled. Much of the work simply wasn't up to code, like unvented bathroom fixtures, hot water heater and furnace--we bought the new furnace because venting the old one would have required major structural work.</p>
<p>Anyway, with the approvals we're in the home stretch. All the walls and ceilings can be closed up and painted, the fixtures put back and we can finally unpack and figure out where everything will go.</p>
<p>So it's like a home now, eh? Give me a beer, dammit.</p>
