<p><b>One solution: Partition Afghanistan</b></p>
<p>Carlton Meyer, editor of G2mil, a warfare research portal, looks at the <a href="http://www.g2mil.com/militaryoptions.htm">Military Options in Afghanistan</a>. He cites and analyzes five variants of military solutions and their costs in money and American deaths:<br />

<ol>

<li>Cruise missile attacks ($4 billion - 0 dead)<br />
</li>
<li>Carpet Bombing strikes ($6 billion - 4 dead<br />
</li>
<li>Ranger Raids ($2 billion - 50 dead)<br />
</li>
<li>Send in helicopter brigades ($20 billion - 1000 dead)<br />
</li>
<li>Land several divisions and overrun Afghanistan ($100 billion - 6000 dead)<br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>He ends the list with what is really a political option: partition Afghanistan along ethnic lines and join those sections up with the appropriate (parent) country: Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Iran (<a href="afghanistan_ethnoling_97.jpg">Here's his map showing the partition</a>. He estimates the cost at $10 billion but as opposed to the other options all this money goes to economic and humanitarian aid to make the scheme work.</p>
<p>Meyer's final analysis: "As for the problem of Afghanistan, just partition it and the problem is solved with little loss of life." Not a bad idea at all.</p>
