<p>I see Kurt Loder and Sujin yammering away from Miami, Billie Joe Armstrong looking wasted on stage, while thinking about Katrina about to <a href="http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/news/2720/hurricane-katrina-do-not-call-911">pound down</a> on the general vicinity of New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain. Karl, I can't join <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/weblog/kmartino/archives/004278.shtml">your prayers</a> but I understand the urge; maybe we should post donation amounts to challenge other bloggers to match or beat it.
