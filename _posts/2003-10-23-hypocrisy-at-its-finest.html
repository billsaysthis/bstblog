<p>Dear Governor Bush,</p>
<p>I was reading in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/23/national/23STAY.html">the paper today</a> about legislation you signed which allows you to intervene in the case of Terry Schiavo. Your action in this case directly inserts "the government" into one person's and one family's private life choices. For many, many years I have listened to members of your Republican party, though not specifically you yourself, explain that the government has no business getting involved in precisely this way; given your prominence in the party, though, one must expect you to be in agreement with such a fundamental position. So can you explain to me how you reconciled your decision regarding Mrs. Schiavo with your longstanding principles?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
<br />Your Pal Bill</p>
