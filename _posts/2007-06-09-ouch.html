<p>Just before bedtime last night, or possibly even as I got into bed, I pulled a muscle on the back of my right thigh. Every time I rolled over and this part of my leg came flat on the bed it gave me a sharp burst of pain. On waking up when, as you might imagine, there was much rolling there was also much pain.</p>
<p>TS1, barely awake herself, was the good nurse and got me a heating pad and Ibuprofin but they weren't much help. I couldn't go for our usual Saturday morning bagel and coffee walk so we drove but that wasn't a huge improvement; getting in and out of the car and using the brakes caused new bursts but my sweetie drove home at least.</p>
<p>Now, a couple of hours later, it seems to be subsiding into a residual soreness.</p>
<p>Happy Saturday morning, peeps!</p>
