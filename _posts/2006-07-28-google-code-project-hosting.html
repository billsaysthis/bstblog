<p><a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/">Google's new open source project hosting</a> looks neat. Put me in the camp of the SourceForge discontented but I'm happy to see a major competitor. Of course RubyForge does a pretty good job for Ruby and Rails prjects too, don't want to neglect those hardworking guys.</p>
<p>But can anyone out there actually access the code? I tried to use the browser view on half a dozen different projects and see nothing except empty directories, same result for the one project I attempted to download using TortoiseSVN. Sent in an email though I wonder how much of a response to expect; no doubt the GMonster will sort this out soonish if it's on their end.</p>
<p>I'm having coffee at Krugle tomorrow with their CEO and VP of Product Management, they ought to have an interesting opinion on this. Bet they plan to index it as fully as they can ASAP.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Update:</span> The Google Project Hosting problem had a simple explanation. All the projects I looked at had not yet checked in any code! I think Google released this a bit prematurely, a number of fit and finish issues should have been closed first, but the leads probably felt the need to make it available during OSCON.</p>
<p>The Krugle CEO <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2006_07_23_blog_archive.phtml#115419974969312231">did have an answer</a>, by the way. He said Google will not really want to spend the resources to offer a competing service any time soon because the added value is too small relative to other opportunities, and that Google staff he discussed this with agreed. Good for them.</p>
