<p>Good thing about having 500 cable channels: Bravo's series Musicians hosted by “Rolling Stone” Contributing Editor David Wild featured <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/sections/shows_mus_costello.php">Elvis Costello tonight</a>, presumably in support of his new record <a href="http://www.islandrecords.com/elviscostello/music.las">When I Was Cruel</a>. You can see some <a href="http://uk.music.yahoo.com/elviscostello/">decent streaming video</a> featuring Tear Your Head Off from the new record. Ann and Nancy Wilson, Heart by another name, are the guests next Monday (10 p.m. PST).</p>
<p>Tear Your Head Off (It's a Doll Revolution), which he performed with electric guitar and drum machine to emulate his home demo process, was from an attempt by Elvis last year to create a TV series. Didn't quite make it to the fall schedule but he described a very subversive plot. Four women form a band and come to America to bankrupt the country. In every way! I noticed in this setup he was using a Line6 <a href="http://www.line6.com/main/Products/ProductGroups/ProductDetails.cfm?ProductID=7">POD 2.0</a> effects system, very cool box, similar to the <a href="http://www.line6.com/Main/Products/ProductGroups/ProductGroup_Knows.cfm?GroupID=3&amp;CFID=621200&amp;CFTOKEN=96206669">Line6 Flextone amp</a> I use.</p>
<p>Picture Elvis sitting on a comfy chair onstage with the interviewer and an acoustic guitar. Takes something to just let loose and sing his songs just sitting there! Recounts his career, telling stories around the songs. Some of the performances: <a href="http://www.rhino.com/Sounds/RA_Files/74/74285/74285_005.ra">Allison</a>, What's So Funny About Peace, Love, and Understanding, <a href="http://www.rhino.com/Sounds/RA_Files/74/74285/74285_009.ra">Mystery Dance</a>, Angels Wanna Wear My Red Shoes, Radio Radio. Closed out the show with an excellent electric version (bouncing bass on tape) of Watching the Detectives! The show barely covered his first few career years, could have gone on for a couple of hours more easily.</p>
<p>Check out Elvis' music in the <a href="http://www.rootnode.org/tabsearch.php?bandsearch=1&amp;sstring=costello_elvis">OLGA archive</a> to get some guitar music and lyrics. And don't miss Elvis hosting the "Elvis Costello Hour" on MTV2 Saturday May 4 at 10pm EST!</p>
