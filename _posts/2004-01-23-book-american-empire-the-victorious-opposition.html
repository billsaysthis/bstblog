<p>Humpph: <a href="http://www.sfsite.com/~silverag/opposition.html">American Empire: The Victorious Opposition</a> is the seventh novel in a sequence of ten books through which Harry Turtledove explores what might have happened if <a href="http://bhere.com/plugugly/lost/">General Lee's Special Orders 191</a> reached him in 1862 and the Confederacy went on to win the Civil War.  Since it's somewhere in the middle of a long story (this volume alone has more than 500 pages), a review is difficult, though it is the conclusion of the <em>American Empire</em> trilogy and therefore ties up some of the threads; it covers the years 1934-1941.</p>
<p>Turtledove has adopted an interesting approach in the series, almost like that used by TV soap operas, creating many characters, devoting a few pages to each, and constantly cycling through their stories. These characters are all over the map geographically and demographically, though few--quite unlike a soap opera--ever meet. <em>Opposition</em> essentially focuses on a character named Jake Featherston, now president of the Confederate States of America, and the effect his actions have on his own country and the USA (which now occupies English-speaking Canada).</p>
<p>If you've followed <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/entertain/bookreviews.phtml#6678904">the story</a> <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_12_01_blog_archive.phtml#90012872">this far</a>, keep reading; if you haven't, start at <a href="http://www.sfsite.com/~silverag/remain.html">the beginning</a> and not here.</p>
