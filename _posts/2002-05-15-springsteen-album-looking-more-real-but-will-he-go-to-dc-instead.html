<p>With <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/entertain/rating_bruce.phtml">Bruce</a> you never know what's going to happen. In the early '80s and again in the early '90s he recorded complete albums, was on the verge of releasing them, and decided otherwise, essentially scrapping them. For all the talk that Tracks was intended to clean out the vaults, there is no doubt that he has several more Tracks-sized releases possible, several hundred songs completely recorded and mostly mixed.</p>
<p>The latest news, though, is that a new record around October (of this year) is looking more and more likely. Just yesterday, for instance, <a href="http://www.backstreets.com/news.html">Backstreets reports</a> that five new tracks were played at a Sony meeting, where retail, distribution, and label representatives received a first taste of the forthcoming album. Springsteen manager Jon Landau was on hand to present the new recordings to an assembly of roughly 50 people. He <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_01_27_blog_archive.phtml#9305512">continues to be seen</a> in Atlanta, site of the recording studio he's using, in the company of alleged co-producer Brendan O'Brien.</p>
<p>Next, some politicos are attempting to put together a campaign to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/05/14/springsteen.senate.reut/index.html">elect the Boss</a> to the Senate even though he hasn't responded to their six monthlong effort. Boss Springsteen? Shades of old time Tammany Hall, eh? The organizers, who were with Jesse Ventura's Minnesota gubernatorial effort, has a <a href="http://drafttheboss2002.com/">Draft the Boss website</a>. Their idea is for him to run as an independent since they claim neither major party has strong candidate. Democratic incumbent Robert Toricelli has "spent long months facing charges connected to campaign contributions" and the Republican frontrunner is another well-off guy spending his own millions to get in office. Somehow I doubt Bruce would be willing to get involved.</p>
