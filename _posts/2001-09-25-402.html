<p><b>Cool utility software</b></p>
<p>URL Capture from <a href="http://www.urltoy.com/">URL Toy Software</a>, a shareware utility currently in beta testing, saves all Internet addresses in all open Internet Explorer windows and restores them on command; it can also be set save and restore on Windows shutdown and restart. I like this one and even helped edit the help file (my edits are not included in the version currently available for download).</p>
