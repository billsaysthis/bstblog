<p><b>We have seen the future, and it looks like us</b></p>
<p>Thanks to the redoubtable captain of the <a href="http://denbeste.nu/entries/00001035.shtml">USS Clueless</a> we have an amazing 1998 article by Ralph Peters titled <a href="http://carlisle-www.army.mil/usawc/parameters/98spring/peters.htm">Spotting the Losers: Seven Signs of Non-Competitive States</a>. Peters is a retired US Army intelligence officer and he points out the simple facts underlying globalization in a very clear, concise, and intelligent manner. Read the article and the Clueless analysis.</p>
