<p><b>Do it yourself law for Californians</b><br />

<p>Our thoughtful employees in Sacramento have assembled the <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/selfhelp/">California Courts Self-Help Center</a>. "This site is intended to help you find legal assistance, learn about California law, work better with an attorney, and represent yourself in some legal matters. This site does not provide legal advice." Looking through the site, it appears to have a good deal of useful information for state residents even if you intend to use an attorney. One topic not found on the site is information for individuals facing criminal charges but I agree that such information is lower priority than what is here: family and juvenile law, domestic violence, small claims, traffic court, and help finding free or low cost legal representation and additional information resources.</p>
<p>Another top site for this kind of information is <a href="http://www.nolo.com">Nolo Self-Help Law</a>, which just won the <a href="http://www.webbyawards.com/main/webby_awards/nominees.html">2001 Webby Award</a> in the government and law category.</p>
