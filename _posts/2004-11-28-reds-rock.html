<p>What an awesome result! <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4028103.stm">Liverpool 2-1 Arsenal</a> today at Anfield, with up and coming striker Neil Mellor (only playing because of injuries to Cisse, Baros, and Luis Garcia) driving the winner home from 25 yards seconds before the final whistle. I am so stoked and can't wait to see the replay of this match on FSW Wednesday afternoon. After the goal drought of recent matches, taking three points against the defending champions is absolutely briliant.</p>
