<p>Cowboys owner Jerry Jones will probably admit to being a fisherman, when he can take a break from roaming the sidelines at Texas Stadium, and today he landed a world class catch in his boat: Bill Parcells signed a four year, $17.1 million contract to coach the Cowboys. Reportedly, the key points were not money (Parcells asked for and got the average of the top five coaching salaries) but control. The Tuna wanted to make sure he could get the system in place he believes is necessary to control his own fate and so he will hire and fire assistants and have a strong voice in player decisions, two things Jones has not given any coach. In any case, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/s/2003/0102/1486245.html">America's Team is still a financial dream</a>, even after three 5-11 seasons, making money hand over fist; the team even printed a few hundred <a href="http://secure1.esportspartners.com/store-cowboys/index.cfm?CFID=950039&amp;CFTOKEN=24648023">t-shirts</a> celebrating the new arrival.</p>
<p>Fact: Returning to the grind means Parcells has been removed from the current NFL Hall of Fame ballot. Prediction: Parcells will fail to turn things around much after two seasons (6-10, 8-8/9-7 but no playoffs), then ride back out of town with a flush bank account and renewed health issues. He should still make it to Canton in, say, 2006.</p>
