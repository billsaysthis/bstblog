<p>Mike Mularkey, who spent the last three seasons as the offensive coordinator for the Pittsburgh Steelers, was named today as the new head man in Buffalo. The Bills have a solid trio of skills players--Drew Bledsoe as QB, Travis Henry at RB and Eric Moulds at WR--and a proven guy like Mularkey, nine years a tight end in the NFL, ought to be able to do better than last season's 15.2 points/game and 30th place in overall offense. The hiring leaves Chicago and Oakland as the only teams without coaches; seems like St. Louis is going to stick with Martz another year even though many observers don't see why.</p>
