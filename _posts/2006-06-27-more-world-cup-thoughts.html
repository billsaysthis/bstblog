<p>Quick hits:
<ul>
<li>Hey Argentina and Ukraine teams, 1974 called and they want their hair back!</li>
<li>Speaking of Ukraine, could their game with Switzerland been worse? Both teams played negative football but Schevchenko's boys went forward so rarely it seemed like they thought their passports were needed to cross onto Switzerland's side of the field, and they'd left the passports back at the hotel. The Chocolatiers made a total hash of the shootout, though, and will go home having not allowed a goal the entire tournament.</li>
<li>Italy should not have been gifted the penalty kick at the end of their match against Australia, one more terrible decision by a referee in a Finals which has seen a monsoon of them.</li>
<li>Ronaldo may be out of shape but he passed Gerd Mueller with a lovely early strike against Ghana this morning for his 15th career goal to move atop the World Cup all time scoring list. Kingson had no chance one-v-one.</li>
<li>Ronaldinho hasn't yet been much of a factor but Brazil has dominated every match anyway. One thing that I never really noticed about him before is that he really doesn't do much on defense.</li>
<li>Ghana are down 2-0 as I'm writing, an hour into the Brazil match, but despite missing leader Michael Essien from yellows, the Africans are energetic and powerful and not giving up despite being down to the World #1s.</li>
</ul>
