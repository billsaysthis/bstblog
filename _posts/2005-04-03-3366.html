<p>Spam, of course, is just generally annoying and I wish it would all go away. In the meantime, at least some of it is good for a laugh. A few examples:
<ul>
<li>forget to fill in or remove templates variables so it's addressed to {firstname}{lastname}</li>
<li>expect anyone to spend money or time from getting an email stuffed with nonsensical content and absurdly spelled words</li>
<li>confirmation of a purchase from a site I never visited, particularly in combination with the first two gaffes.</li>
</ul>
<p> Then I wonder how many people never see this part of it because they read HTML mail directly.</p>
