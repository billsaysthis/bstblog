<p>This was a total hoot. Cross super kung fu fanatics with a soccer competition against a team lead by an evil megalomaniac and over the top acrobatics. That's what you get in <a href="http://www.miramax.com/shaolin_soccer/">Shaolin Soccer (Siu lam juk kau)</a>. Stephen Chow does a Woody Allen, he's the writer, director and star, and now I'm really looking forward to his <a href="http://www.kungfuhustle.com/">Kung Fu Hustle</a> that opens Friday. Very strange and hard to describe, nothing like anything we get from Hollywood, just totally worth your time.</p>
