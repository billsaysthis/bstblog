<p><b>CSS Frustration!</b><br />

<p>The reason there's not much posted yesterday is I spent most of the day, at least six hours, experimenting with Cascading Style Sheets. The biggest issue, and I know this seems terribly petty, is that while the margin seems to be taking around the top, right, and left it isn't working on the bottom. I still haven't found an answer for that one! Also, I decided to check how the page looks in other browsers. Opera is mostly okay, except for the bottom margin and also I needed to put in a hack to get it to show the right margin. Netscape 4.x is just a mess but I found from looking in the newsgroups that this is to be expected and I think most people will be using the newer 6.1 version anyway. Netscape 6.1 respects the left and right margins only and it uses only a small portion of the browser window, giving the page a 'smooshed' look. I think I will only worry about getting the look good in IE and Opera and Netscape can go suck an egg.<br /></p>
