<p>Sadly, Dr. Robert Atkins <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/04/17/obit.atkins/">died today</a> from the trauma caused when he slipped on an icy Manhattan sidewalk nine days ago (<a href="http://atkinscenter.com/atkinslegacy/atkinslegacybio.html">Official announcement</a>). Atkins was known worldwide for his <a href="http://atkinscenter.com/">nutritional approach</a>, which the Sweet One, myself, and many others follow, developed in the '60s and early '70s from the patients at his cardiology practice and bought by millions in the years since he published the <a href="http://atkinscenter.com/shop/products/Dr_Atkins_New_Diet_Revolution_PocketSize_Soft_Cover_2002_Edition.html">Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution</a> as a book. If you're looking to lose weight and adopt a way of eating that can keep you healthy for years, I recommend you look into this.</p>
