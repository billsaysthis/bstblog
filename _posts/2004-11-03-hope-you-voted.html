<p>Man, sitting here watching the election returns, small numbers trickling in. Races here and there going as expected, some surprises. Barama making mush of Keyes in Illinois. Georgia showing true Republican colors. Lines out the door past the closing time in Ohio. Cool NY Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/politics/2004_ELECTIONRESULTS_GRAPHIC/index.html">Flash  results</a>.</p>
<p>Looks good for Kerry, 77 to 66 on CNN as I write this.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">5:35 PST:</span> Bush 87 to 77 but no surprises in the states in so far. Allegheny County (Pittsburgh) will leave polls open an extra 90 minutes to accomodate voters in line, PA is still too close to call.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">6:21 PST:</span> Dewey Beats Truman! Oops, that was the wrong headline 56 years ago. Mongiardo is eating The Bun. The South looks solid for Bush, if Kerry wins do we move closer to a Second Civil War?</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">8:47 PST:</span> Gay marriage is going down in flames all over, which is stupid and sucks. FL for Bush is same as last time. Polls, schmolls. Ohio, we count on you to keep us from four more years.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">10:22 PST:</span> Sad, sad, sad. Ohio went red and even if Kerry takes every electoral vote left, that would only throw the decision to the House. So four more years. Thanks a bunch, Ohio and Florida. People have said that if Bush was re-elected they'd hit the road to Canada, Europe or wherever but I wonder where you can go to get away from the effects of this outcome.<br /></p>
