<p><b>Greil Marcus interview: Dylan, Elvis, and the art of writing</b>
<p>Greil Marcus has been one of the leading music critics since the late '60s and he still has interesting, relevant things to say. In a recent <a href="http://www.powells.com/authors/marcus.html">interview</a>, he talks about his <a href="http://www.powells.com/search/DTSearch/search?author=greil+marcus&amp;perpage=100" title="Marcus' books on Powells.com">books</a> on Dylan, Elvis, and the Sex Pistols as well as his <a href="http://www.salon.com/directory/topics/greil_marcus/index.html" title="Real Life Top 10">current Salon column</a>. Best quote: "I try not to walk through the world with preconceptions and rules, that something is good if it fits certain categories in certain ways."</p>
