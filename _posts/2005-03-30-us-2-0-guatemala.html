<p>The boys bounced back from Saturday's disappointment and a return to sea level down in Alabama. A couple of lineup changes: Brian Ching came on in place of suspended Damarcus Beasley (yellow cards), Steve Ralston took a midfield spot from resting Carlos Reyna, meaning Landon wore the captain's band, and Cory Gibb was on Greg Berhalter on the back line.</p>
<p>We showed terrific energy right from the start, which Guatemala just wasn't ready to handle, and so in the 11th minute Eddie Johnson broke through for his eigth goal in eight games with the national team. His new FC Dallas strike partner, Carlos Ruiz, trotted out his complete trick bag over the 90 but all he earned was a yellow card that will keep him out of Guatemala's next qualifier. Props to American defender Oguchi Onyewu for shutting dow Ruiz and giving a much stronger performance than he did Saturday.</p>
<p>Well into the second half Ralston banged one past their keeper, probably the best player for the visitors given the many saves he had to make and the lack of any serious pressure on Kasey Keller. Who recorded his 37th shutout for the US team tonight.</p>
<p>Nice break for us: Mexico could only manage a 1-1 draw on the road at Panama so we are second in the CONCACAF group after three matches, six points to Mexico's seven, and the next match not until June.</p>
