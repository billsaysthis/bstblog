<p>Apparently my 'temporary new home' loaner laptop will be less temporary than I'd ever expected. Just got a call from Fry's to find out that because my poor, broken down Toshiba is still under the manufacturer's warranty the store is required to send it to Toshiba for repair. And the average (meaning it could easily be longer) turnaround time is eight weeks. EIGHT WEEKS?!?!?! Have you ever heard of a consumer business that can take so long to do a repair?</p>
<p>I was informed that this is not Fry's or Toshiba's number but an industry average across manufacturers and big retailers so my experience would be the same wherever I'd bought it. Of course if the hard drive had managed to live out another three weeks I'd be past the one year mark and then the Fry's extended warranty would kick in, and I'd get back Little Steven in under a week.</p>
<p>What a freaking joke.</p>
