<p>Go with it, because I'll be back<br />
<br />With the twins! We got a little lost--<br />
<br />Oh come on!--get out of the crease.<br />
<br />We're gonna have to put you back in.</p>
<p>You are on your own. Complete this mission.<br />
<br />Drop your weapons...hold your fire.<br />
<br />Maybe we'll have better luck next year...<br />
<br />One stifling defense!</p>
<p>Is it gold? Go for the gold<br />
<br />I'm running out of time<br />
<br />When we try cases it gets ugly, are they miracles?<br />
<br />Experience.</p>
<p>Chasing through backyards and over hedges<br />
<br />Won't make it any better. Thundering hooves, running, rumbling<br />
<br />Craggy mountains, rocks strewn about<br />
<br />Transcend the ordinary. Baby we'll never go back.</p>
<p>You keep up the good work, No Doubt<br />
<br />I know one thing for sure, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry<br />
<br />Make it! Hit it! We are soldiers<br />
<br />Believe it!</p>
<p>Hey Oh My Oh My</p>
<p>I am proud to be an American<br />
<br />One wet one dry<br />
<br />Can I get just one?<br />
<br />Yo!</p>
<p>They slit my throat--it's the money--<br />
<br />Two is too many<br />
<br />Another reason!</p>
<p>Last year, I blogged my opinion on the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_02_03_blog_archive.phtml#9347086">Super</a> <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_02_03_blog_archive.phtml#9344293">Bowl</a> <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_02_03_blog_archive.phtml#9344246">commercials</a> so this year I thought I'd try something a little different. The poem above is composed of one line, one word, or maybe a bit more, from just about all of the commercials shown in the first quarter of the game. Some of the commercials made even taking one word difficult. An experiment but came out interesting, I think.</p>
