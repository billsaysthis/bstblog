<p><strong>Reason to love the web, part {next}: Spider-man</strong></p>
<p>Downloading <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/">cool movie trailers</a> in seconds, like the one for next Spring's <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/columbia/spiderman/">Spider-Man</a>. More video and other neat stuff at the <a href="http://www.spiderman.sonypictures.com/main.php">official movie site</a>. You wouldn't expect Tobey Maguire to be that much of an action hero but looking at the trailer and other clips he shows that a good actor can do almost any role, though I bet at age 26 he's tired of playing high school students; he must be betting that this picture will have long legs and turn into a franchise. <a href="http://us.imdb.com/EGallery?source=ss&amp;group=0157503&amp;photo=4&amp;path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Dunst,+Kirsten">Kirsten Dunst</a>, totally hot with hair dyed red, has no trouble convincing us she's the adorable love interest. <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0095497">Willem Dafoe</a> will be as slimey as he wants to be as the billionaire gone insane and twisted into super baddie Green Goblin. The movie is written by David Koepp, will it be as good as his <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0107290">Jurassic Park</a> or as bad as his <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0164181">Stir of Echoes</a>? Will director Sam Raimi live up to <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120324">A Simple Plan</a> or down to the Tom Selleck snorer <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0126916">For Love of the Game</a>? This opens the day before my birthday and seems like a treat to look for.</p>
