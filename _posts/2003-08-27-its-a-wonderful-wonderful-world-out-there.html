<p>Forget about being safe or happy, just struggle to get through the weapons, the lies and the people who will kill you for not agreeing with their version of the invisible little man in the sky.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A50470-2003Aug26.html">Iran Admits Foreign Help on Nuclear Facility</a> - hint: the help came from our primary in the war in Afghanistan, the same folks who thought it would be cool to help the North Koreans too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46805-2003Aug26.html">2004 Deficit to Reach $480 Billion, Report Forecasts</a> - so cutting taxes will cure our economic ills? Or, will the changes actually pass on a huge debt burden to the next generation, already wondering where the money will be found for their turn at Social Security and Medicare?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.workingforchange.com/article.cfm?ItemID=15515">A monument to intolerance</a> - Iraq, Alabama, wherever you go, there they are. God may or may not be everywhere but people who are willing to tell you exactly how the Almighty wants humans to live life certainly are.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, did my folks feel <a href="http://www.nynewsday.com/news/nationworld/nation/ny-bc-nj--jerseyearthquake0826aug26,0,4025452.story?coll=nyc-topnews-short-navigation">the 3.8 quake</a> that hit their neck of the woods today?</p>
