<p>We had the first <a href="http://webloggerusergroup.manilasites.com">Webloggers User Group</a> meeting Tuesday night here in Mountain View and it was a big success with over 40 people showing up only two weeks after the group was announced. Kudos to Scoble for a fine job! <a href="http://www.openwire.com/web/index.php">Jay</a>, among others, took some <a href="http://www.openwire.com/collections/20011016-WUG/">snaps</a> including one showing <a href="http://www.openwire.com/collections/20011016-WUG/?pic=108-0861_img.jpg">me playing secretary</a> (my <a href="http://webloggerusergroup.manilasites.com/stories/storyReader$8">meeting notes</a>). Tom has <a href="http://www.fal.net/wug/">photos and a cool logo</a> for the group, including a good one of <a href="http://www.fal.net/wug/wug016b.jpg">my back</a>.</p>
