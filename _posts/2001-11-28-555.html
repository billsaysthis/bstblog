<p><strong>Chomsky: Still absurd and proud of it</strong></p>
<p>Doc <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2001/11/28#politicsAsUnusual">points</a> us to an article in Dawn, a Pakistani publication, reporting on a Nov. 25 <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2001/11/27/top4.htm">Noam Chomsky lecture</a> in Islamabad. The MIT professor has been speaking out against the US government's response to the September 11 attacks since that day, before any actual American military activity. In this lecture, he essentially equates Al Quaeda and the American government, terming the actions of both the strong victimizing the weak. Mainly, Chomsky uses the lecture to explain how the US has been a violent bully for two hundred years, killing and maiming as it pleases: "The number of victims of US savagery are huge right upto the present moment." Okay Noam, you can sit down now.</p>
