<p>"Patience is a virtue" is one cliche's advice I've never really mastered. For example, in the Hebrew alphabet, the letters each have a numerical value: aleph is one, gimmel is two, and chai (the letter has no English equivalent but is the first one in the word Hanukah) is eighteen. As in English, sometimes the same sound/word in Hebrew has more than one meaning. Chai also means life. Hence the song "To life, to life, l'chaim." So 18 and multiples of it have special meaning; monetary gifts are often given in multiples of it in dollars or sheckels.</p>
<p>Today is double chai, or 36 days, until I marry Vivian. And I truly can't wait. As <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scoble</a> wrote so eloquently last year in the weeks leading up to the wedding to his own Sweet One, Vivian is just the most wonderful woman in the world. She is kind, considerate, funny, friendly, sexy, charming, caring, and a good cook. Love, it's a good thing. More of you should have it your own life, I only wish it for you.</p>
<p>So screw patience and let's all do whatever's necessary to get May 10 here as soon as possible, okay?</p>
