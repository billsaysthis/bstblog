<p>Just saw a half hour of standup comedy with <a href="http://www.carlosmencia.com/">Carlos Mencia</a> on Comedy Central, an episode of <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/standup/central/detail.jhtml?p=/comedians/m/carlos_mencia.xml">Comedy Central Presents</a>. This guy was excellent but his comedy was so real it almost hurt. A more modern, Latino Geroge Carlin or maybe even towards Lenny Bruce without necessarily needing profanity and obscenity to make his points about society. Amazing to find out that Carlos gave up a career in insurance too. Catch him if you can.</p>
