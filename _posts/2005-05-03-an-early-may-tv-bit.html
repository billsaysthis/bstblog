<p><span style="font-style:italic;">24</span> is still going strong, for my viewing hour, but as Emeril might say they've hyped the action up another notch to the point where I begin wondering how many more 'days' the producers will be able to come up with and retain even a tenuous link to reality.</p>
<p>The first new <a href="http://www.familyguy.com/"><span style="font-style:italic;">Family Guy</span></a> episode, that was cool. The Griffins still got it goin' on and so does creator Seth MacFarlane. Lots of good jokes and good to see that Fox is willing to bring the show back from the abyss. Since MacFarlane does several of the main voices, getting the crew back together probably wasn't an issue. Have <span style="font-style:italic;">American Dad</span> on the Tivo, didn't watch it yet.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Andromeda i</span>s almost done. The producers did come up with a pretty whacky and original concept for the last season, though I'm sure someone will point to another show that did something similar that I've just not seen, maybe <span style="font-style:italic;">Farscape</span>. At least they knew well in advance and planned out a real ending.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Star Trek: Enterprise</span> is almost done too but of course Moore and Braga weren't given enough time to truly wrap it up like the other Trek series. Too bad. The recent two part Mirror Universe episodes showed there's still plenty of good thinking and writing going on there, but the franchise will be back soon enough and I'll undoubtedly watch.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Wire in the Blood</span> wrapped tonight with another amazing episode, I do believe this is the end period. Robson Green, man, Dennis Franz only wishes he was Green.</p>
