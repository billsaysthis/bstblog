<p>From 1963, husband and wife Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward play New Yorkers on an awkward collision in Paris in a lightweight comedy called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057360/">A New Kind of Love</a>. Written and directed by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0789520/">Melville Shavelson</a>, Newman is a newspaper columnist sent to Paris as his boss's idea of punishment (for sleeping with the boss's wife!) and Woodward is in the city with her department store owner boss and co-worker to see the new designer lines. Woodward, though, has sworn off men and love after one bad relationship; the film's challenge is to put them together and the mechanism is having her, in a wig and fake Eastern European accent, pretend to be a hooker who Newman, a man who has sex with every other attractive woman he meets, only hires to tell him Schehezerade-like tales. They've all done better.</p>
