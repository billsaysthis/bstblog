<p>I recently started using Firefox. Now that I have I can see that the <a href="http://www.jhtc.org">Jewish High Tech Community website</a> that I built doesn't display properly and doesn't validate (honestly, I didn't check this out when it came out fine in IE, mea culpa). I could <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/contact.phtml?sub=JHTC%20site%20help">use some help</a>, if you care to take a look.</p>
<p>Some details:<br />

<ul>
<li>If I leave out the doctype declaration, everything looks good in IE; if I include it, strict or transitional, IE displays the same bad stuff as Firefox.</li>
<li>The CSS validator gives me hassles for the use of a width attribute.</li>
</ul>
<p> Uggh!<br /></p>
