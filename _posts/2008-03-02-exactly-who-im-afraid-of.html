<p>For years I've been talking with people about the way that every year technology and globalization enable smaller numbers of people to do greater amounts of damage. 9/11 was one horrifying example; this week John Robb wrote about <a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2008/02/henry-okah.html">a man who embodies this paradigm, Henry Okah</a>.<br />
<blockquote>"Henry Okah is likely someone you have never heard about. Despite that, he is one of the most important people alive today, a true innovator in warfare: a global guerrilla."</p></blockquote>
<p>Working mainly against Shell Oil in the Niger Delta region of Africa, Okah and his contractors have stolen enough oil to be a close second to George Bush's ruinous Iraq adventure as primary factors behind the current $100 per barrel price of oil.</p>
<p>Fortunately for us Okah was arrested recently in Angola and extradited to Nigeria. There are plenty of other dangerous men, of that I have no disagreement with our current administration; when Bush's second term ends in 11 months there will be a few less.</p>
