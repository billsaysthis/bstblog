<p>From a <a href="http://www.sportsfilter.com/news/16866/hard-lessons">SportsFilter discussion</a> of <a href="http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/6707994/hard-lessons">Bill Barnwell's Grantland article</a>:</p>
<p>In general, I agree with the article though winning this Gold Cup would have been useful as entry ticket for the next Confederations Cup. If Bradley's strategy had gotten us the trophy I could accept the roster choices.</p>
<p>As it did not there are definitely questions. For instance, why not play three young defenders plus Boca or Cherundolo for a bit of maturity? Putting those two as the first choice fullbacks meant a complete lack of pace out wide since our so-called wingers were constantly cutting inside; 4-6-0 was more like 4-3-3-0 with no one except Adu consistently getting wider than the 18 yard box.</p>
<p>Edu has consistently not gotten the playing time I think he's earned from Bradley despite his club form. Jones hasn't shown me the ability to do the offensive business required from his position, so I'm just not getting the decision.</p>
<p>I think the author doesn't take injuries sufficiently into account though. With healthy Stuart Holden, Charlie Davies, Tim Chandler, and Jozy not going out so early the team would have been much younger and pacier. Add in Edu over Jones and I honestly think that team would've steamrolled the Gold Cup.</p>
