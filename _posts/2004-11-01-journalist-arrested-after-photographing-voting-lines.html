<p>People have said I'm overly pessimistic about the lengths to which Republicans will go to continue and deepen their control over America. And then I read about the <a href="http://www.local6.com/news/3878057/detail.html">arrest of photographer Jim Henry</a> down in Florida for doing his job. I don't care what rules Theresa LePore may have enacted (just two business days before the election, mind you), the sherrif's department and county attorney should have recognized them as prima facie violation of the First Amendment. So much for Republicans and their alleged respect for the Constitution.</p>
