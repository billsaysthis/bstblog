<p>[Getting back to <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/poetry/?poemname=paces_routes_fates.html&amp;list=nyd">my</a> <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/poetry/?poemname=ride_on.html&amp;list=nyd">New</a> <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/poetry/?poemname=another_year.html&amp;list=nyd">Year's</a> <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/poetry/?poemname=when_wings_were_broken.html&amp;list=nyd">Day</a> <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/poetry/?poemname=placing_the_day.html&amp;list=nyd">tradition</a>...]</p>
<p>As Artie said of a man who went away this year,<br />"You can be a positive ion or a negative ion and<br />I choose to be a positive." In that vein, we say,<br />This year just ended did not disappoint.</p>
<p>For us the cheers outclassed the dour spirits<br />Rewards surpassed payment required<br />Delight outweighed distaste but most important<br />Love received overwhelmed all sadnesses.</p>
<p>Turn your eyes ahead and focus on that<br />Allegorical tree trunk spanning the chasm<br />Above the river of days and years yet to come and<br />Measure its diameter and strength and color.</p>
<p>Does the tree appear a bigger and healthier,<br />More substantial path across for you and yours<br />From this closer vantage point, than on<br />New Year's Days in the past?</p>
<p>When you crane your neck out from our<br />Common past's cliff and look down to the water<br />Is the River calm as a lazy August afternoon or<br />Raging like late April after a storm?</p>
<p>I know that seeing the rage is easier by far<br />Black skies and thunder near the horizon<br />Sharp rocks poking out of the frothy water<br />But is that the life you want for you and yours?</p>
<p>Obstacles and blind curves will surely come up<br />Bad news lurks in every conversation and news brief<br />Faults of the many outweighing the good of the few<br />Tempting you at all turns to the downward spiral.</p>
<p>And yet and still... I ask you to resist, even to struggle<br />Choose good and happiness and friendship and love<br />"Rage against the dying of the light" as Dylan urged--<br />See the bigger, healthier, beautiful bridge.</p>
