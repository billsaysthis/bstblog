<p>Testing the new Blogger editor first time.</p>
<p><em>[Later]</em> I cannot say I'm thrilled with <a href="http://www.massless.org/?archive=2004/07/note-on-usefulness-of-wysiwyg-editing">the improvements</a> in the editor. How many Blogger users, for instance, need to link to gopher or WAIS servers? And the old shortcuts, like CTRL+SH+T for the emphasis tag, are worn into my fingers after three plus years but no longer work. Viewing this entry as is in the Edit HTML tab shows that a non-breaking space was inserted on the otherwise blank, second line of this post, why is that? And even though it says Edit HTML, I'm not shown the &lt;br&gt; or &lt;p&gt; tags that are obviously in here. No, not thrilled at all.</p>
<p><em>[Even Later]</em> Also, I'm still not thrilled with the recently introduced overall interface. Why oh why couldn't Google leave the old style, with editing box on top and post listing on bottom, as an option for those who prefer it? The new style introduces unnecessary extra key and mouse work. The interface was essentially dumbed down with no advanced mode for experienced users. And they still haven't added Trackbacks or Categories, which I always thought were the two most requested new features.<br />

<br />Interested <a href="http://www.massless.org/?archive=2004/07/note-on-usefulness-of-wysiwyg-editing">discussion/bug reporting</a> over at Massless, the blog of the primary coder for this stuff.<br /></p>
