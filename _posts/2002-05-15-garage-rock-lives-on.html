<p>Have you listened to <a href="http://www.hardrock.com/LittleSteven/archive.asp">Little Steven's Underground Garage</a> yet? Very cool radio show (Sunday nights) but the shows are also available on the website. I just listened to Show 4, which featured versions of "Hey Joe" and "Louie Louie" I'd never heard before plus excellent tunes from The Yardbirds, The Kinks, Flaming Groovies, Nazz, two hours worth of cool guitar and organ driven music from the '60s to today. Get cracking!</p>
