<p><strong>MS: Work for us, get threatened?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft of course sees Linux as a threat to their business, particularly on the server side of things. So they do what any large business would and set up a group of people with extra knowledge and tools to support the sales team. And its true that execs would prefer competitors/targets find out too many details about such an effort. But the part I find really creepy about this <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/23518.html">memo from Windows division VP Brian Valentine</a> is his threat to monitor whether his own staff are forwarding his internal email to outsiders. Which must have happened for The Register to get a hold of it, eh?</p>
<p style="font-size:80%;">"PS: I used to run Exchange -- so if you think I am not tracking this message, think again. Don't forward it! And if you have forward rules that have forwarded this message, then perhaps you should think again about forwarding internal email with those rules. I want to give you folks all the information I can in a very open way. If we continue to have bad apples or careless people out there, I will not be able to help you by sending this kind of information!"</p>
