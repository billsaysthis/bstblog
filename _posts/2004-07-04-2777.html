<p>Spent the day <a href="http://www.ucomics.com/nonsequitur/2004/07/02/">fecking</a> around with <a href="http://www.sportsfilter.com/lockerroom/comments.cfm/561">music</a>, finding that iTunes for Windows is not the devil's spawn even though goddam says it's the dark side--and she should know. Plus watching soccer, always doing that on the weekends these days. Feck baseball.</p>
