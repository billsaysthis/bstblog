<p>In a season filled so far with lethargic 0-0, 1-1 and 2-2 ties and just enough victories snuck in to have them second to the surging FC Dallas, last night the Earthquakes collapsed completely and <a href="http://www.mlsnet.com/MLS/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20050715&amp;content_id=36770&amp;vkey=news_mls&amp;fext=.jsp">lost 3-0</a>.</p>
<p>Danny Califf was back from a red card vacation and so I expected the solid backline performance the preferred foursome of Califf, Edie Robinson, Wade Barrett and Kelly Gray have delivered in the 10 or so games they've been together after Troy Dayak and Craig Waibel were lost for the season. They simply didn't give it. Califf also earned another yellow card, meaning he misses Wednesday's match at Colorado, though I thought Terry Vaughn overreacted in the moment and the kindest interpretation is cumulative fouls.</p>
<p>I also expected to see a bit more flair and connectivity with Dwayne Derosario back from three Gold Cup matches running the Canadian attack. Maybe the unfamiliar humidity of a Washington July evening drained our squad, maybe DC's constant not-quite-a-foul pounding strategy worked as desired. Whatever the reason the Quakes could not penetrate and pound United's Nick Rimando all night, managing only one shot that demanded a serious effort to deflect.</p>
<p>Brad Davis is still away with the US team, most likely will be through next weekend if the Men beat Jamaica today and then the midweek semifinal against the Honduras/Costa Rica winner. I'm guessing but Davis's return should see Ricardo Clarke sitting on the substitute's bench again and that will be a substantial upgrade. Also, and not that I don't appreciate the effort and tenacity of Alejandro Moreno, but boy do I miss Brian Ching. The Hawaiian simply has height and in the box power that the Venezuelan doesn't.</p>
<p>Interestingly, both DC and SJ are in the same ownership fix. Anschutz owns both and has announced its selling both but no new owner has stepped forward, leaving fans to speculate or wander away. At least fans in the capitol have no cause to worry that their side will be relocating; despite leaks indicating that news is imminent for us, the Quakes' fate remains unknown.</p>
