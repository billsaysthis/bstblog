<p>The main contractor showed up today, on time, and started working on giving me a new bathroom. This is very big for me yet a little unnerving because of all the bad stories one hears about contractors. The day went very well though--the man here ripped out the entire bathroom and the tile flooring. So now there's a big hole where I used to have a shower, a vanity, towel racks, mirror, and medicine cabinet. He left the toilet because, well, two toilets are always better than one.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is prep work mostly, I think, and perhaps a visit from the City of Mountain View building inspector. This will look so good when done!</p>
