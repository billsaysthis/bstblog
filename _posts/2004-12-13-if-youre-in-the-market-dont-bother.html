<p>Found through a Google Ad on a <a href="http://www.dawnpennington.com/">friend's site</a>, <a href="http://www.cyberalert.com/blogmonitoring.html">BlogSquirrel</a> comes off instantly as yet another attempt to separate <del>stupid</del> naive businessmen from their cash. The service "[a]utomatically monitors 100,000+ blogs each day" as opposed to using <a href="http://www.technorati.com/" title="There are other similar good, free sites, I'm just using this as an example">Technorati</a> which is not only free but monitors over 5,000,000 sites. I can't find CyberAlert's pricing (the navbar link returns a 404 error at the time this was written) but their PR Grants program page implies a cost of $3,000 per year. Founder William Comcowich justifies the service's utility with articles that coin such <a href="http://www.scip.org/news/v1i18article1.asp">amusing phrases as dotgone</a>, at least when he isn't <a href="http://www.homelinkmortgages.com/learningcenter.php">using his talents</a> to pimp for mortgage spammers.</p>
<p>Do I come across as antagonistic? <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=sardonic">Sardonic</a>? Sure hope so.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.corporateblogging.info/2004/11/blog-monitoring-services-do-it.asp">similar perspective</a>...<br /></p>
