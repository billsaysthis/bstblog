<p>As we all get ready for the second installment of the trilogy to be released next month, I thought I'd start dropping in some linkage to wet your appetites:</p>
<p>To start with, <a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/newline/the_two_towers/">a new trailer</a>. Hint: no matter what your net conneciton speed, get the fullscreen high bandwidth version and wait out the time to download.</p>
<p>Second, an interesting <a href="http://www.popsci.com">Popular Science</a> article on the <a href="http://popsci.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&amp;expire=&amp;urlID=4623808&amp;fb=Y&amp;partnerID=40">software behind the digital effects</a> used to bring the Battle of Helm's Deep, a key confrontation in the film, to life.</p>
<p>As The Sweet One <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/vivroar/archives/2002_11_24_archive.html#85710688">wrote in her blog</a>, we watched the new and longer special edition of <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em> this past Saturday to get in the mood. While I wouldn't recommend purchasing this DVD set, we had a Blockbuster gift card sitting on the dresser for half a year, just begging to be used to rent it. We're waiting for the deluxe, 20 disk set that's sure to be released in 2005, after <em>The Return of the King</em> is all done at the theaters.</p>
