<p>The USC men's basketball team, coming in with an 11-16 regular season record, came within a couple of bad three-pointers of making the NCAA tournament but in the end couldn't overcome Oregon's two Lukes. Props to Henry Bibby, Desmon Farmer, Rory O'Neill, the Craven twins, and all the players for nearly becoming the second team with a losing record to make the Big Dance.</p>
