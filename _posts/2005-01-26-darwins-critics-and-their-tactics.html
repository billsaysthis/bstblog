<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/26/opinion/l26evolution.html">John Hickey says</a>, in a Letter to the Editor printed in today's <em>Times</em>:<br />
<br /><span style="font-style:italic;"><br />
<blockquote>"As a Christian, I do not understand why the teaching of evolution frightens so many fundamentalists. I believe that God made man. This is a matter of faith: it cannot be proved according to any scientific paradigm. I also believe that natural selection was the means by which man came into existence."</p></blockquote>
<p></span>I think I understand why some fundamentalists are fighting this recognition so hard and for so long. They realize that evolution as currently constructed requires human conciousness to be an emergent property arising from the complexity of our nervous system. This assertion directly conflicts with the religious concept of an eternal soul and without a soul all Judeo-Christian religions collapse into meaningless jumble. Some of you may have already understood this, some well-known philosopher may have pointed it out years or centuries ago, but its an epiphany for me. Today.</p>
