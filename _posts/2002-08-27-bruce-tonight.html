<p>The <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_07_07_blog_archive.phtml#85246121">show</a> is finally here! Want some idea of what he'll be playing? Check out Backstreets Magazine's <a href="http://www.backstreets.com/setlists.html">Setlists page</a>. I am finding it difficult to concentrate on anything else. Entirely possible that there will be no entries on the site today except more excitedness about this event until I get home again. Though I may write something. That what's great about a personal site, I can write or not write as I choose, and no one will dock my pay if I don't. <em>I am rambling now, goodbye.</em></p>
<p><em>Update, 7:00:</em> We're just about to leave for the show, the band takes the stage in about an hour and my insides are in an uproar, excitement, anticipation, it's BBBRRRUUUCCCEEE!!!</p>
