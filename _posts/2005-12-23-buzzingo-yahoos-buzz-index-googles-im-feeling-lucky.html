<p><a href="http://tavor.us/">Guy</a> is like <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2005_12_11_blog_archive.phtml#113458045642854136">on fire</a> or something. Working full time for RawSugar is not enough for Mr. Ambition, no, so yesterday he whipped up <a href="http://www.buzzingo.com/">Buzzingo</a>, Your daily buzz dosage. A web 2.0 mashup of the Yahoo! Buzz index, web search and Google Images. You can also see the list for music, movies, sports, games TV and what's moving up. It was written with Ruby On Rails and the Yahoo! API, "which proved sooo much easier to use than Google's API." Befriending Guy has been one of the major perks of working where I do.</p>
