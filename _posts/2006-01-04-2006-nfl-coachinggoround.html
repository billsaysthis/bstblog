<div>It's just sick. The regular season ended two days ago and already the Raiders (nice column title: <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/10700391/">Who in their right mind would coach Raiders?</a>), Vikings, Saints, Rams, Packers, Lions and Texans have sent their coaches pink slips and Dick Vermeil rode his tear-stained hankie into retirement again meaning the Chiefs also need a new headman. the Browns canned their president and Lynn Swann is leaving ABC to <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/10696875/">run for Governor of Pennsylvania</a> (um, yeah right seems like the best response to that whack idea) as a Republican. That's eight coaching vacancies out of 32 teams!</p>
<p>If there weren't so many teams beating them to the punch, I wonder if Tennessee and Philadelphia wouldn't have dumped Jeff Fisher and Andy Reid. I know the Eagles are only one year out of the Super Bowl but that team is just a mess. The Titans have gone down some strange Wonderland path the last couple of years, don't you think?</div>
