<p>Tonight being the first night of Hannukah, TS1 and I exchanged gifts. Being incredibly thoughtful she gave me a <a href="http://store.worldsoccershophosting.com/413762.html">longsleeve Liverpool FC home jersey</a> with #6 on the back since <a href="http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/team/squad/riise/">John Arne Riise</a> is my favorite player on the team these days. Him and his blasting Norwegian left foot! For the record, I gave her an armband sports sleeve for her iPod plus an iTunes gift card and a Green Day live CD/DVD pack, all of which I knew she wanted.</p>
<p>Nothing expensive, much less extravagent, but everything truly appreciated.</p>
<p>On the other hand I am getting truly sickened by the diamond and jewelry industry's advertising. You know the commercials, such as the one where hubby sneaks out of bed to get a diamond gewgaw to drape artfully on the sleeping wife's neck so that she wakes up seeing it. The huge expense proves, of course, his incredible love and devotion to her.</p>
<p>Really. Does that mean because I didn't--and won't--buy my wife useless rocks that she's been brainwashed into thinking have terrific value I don't really love her? Of course it doesn't and fortunately for me she knows so. We can only wish that soon enough more people do and these sick, slick attempts at separating people from huge amounts of hard earned money stop.</p>
<p>You want to buy diamonds because they look great? Fine, no problem. I just can't stand how easily people fall for this line of marketing crap.</p>
<p>Me, I'm more than happy with my jersey.</p>
