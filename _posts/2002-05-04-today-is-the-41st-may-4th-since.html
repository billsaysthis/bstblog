<p>On this day in 1961:</p>
<p>- The author was born in a small cabin deep in the mountains of West Virginia, the child of a Martian and a Man in Black. Oh, wait, he was born in a nice Jewish hospital in the middle of Newark, NJ to a nice couple whose families came from Eastern Europe. Fortunately, no pictures exist either way. Also  on this day:</p>
<p>- JFK <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/govdocs/jfkeo/eo/10938.htm">established</a> the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.</p>
<p>- On <a href="http://lavender.fortunecity.com/casino/403/transcript.html">The Edge of Night</a>, Judy and Margie worry about Ed as he and Mike track killer Tersa Vetter to a deserted mine shaft.</p>
<p>- Thirteen young people set out from Washington, D.C., to New Orleans, Louisiana, to test a new federal law against segregation but these <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/05/12/freedom.riders/">Freedom Riders</a> never made it to New Orleans.</p>
<p>Thanks Mom and Dad!</p>
