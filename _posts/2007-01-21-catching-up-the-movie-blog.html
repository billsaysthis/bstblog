<p>I've been remiss the last few weeks in putting down my writeups in <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/movies">Bill's Movie Reviews</a> so I added seven new entries this weekend, the last twice due to a server-side hiccup:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/movies/2007/01/firewall">Firewall</a> - moderately watchable</li>
<li><a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/movies/2007/01/deep-impact">Deep Impact</a> - very good</li>
<li><a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/movies/2007/01/havoc">Havoc</a> - bad, really bad</li>
<li><a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/movies/2007/01/last-action-hero">Last Action Hero</a> - funny and watchable</li>
<li><a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/movies/2007/01/four-brothers">Four Brothers</a> - very good</li>
<li><a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/movies/2007/01/charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a> - twisted good, better than the Gene Wilder version by far</li>
<li><a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/movies/2007/01/everything-is-illuminated">Everything is Illuminated</a> - spike in forehead bad</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, I watch a lot of movies. I also watched and was disappointed by Arsenal's win at the death over Manchester United this morning and the Bears' easy win over the Saints in the NFC championship this afternoon. Glad to see the Patriots score first, at least, and while I don't wish injuries to any athlete, the timing of in-form Gunners striker Robin van Persie's broken metatarsal is a bit of good news for my Reds.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Related:</span> My five year old blog post <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/singlepost.php?id=8380654">Rex Grossman is not Jewish</a> is apparently a destination of choice for web surfers wondering if the Bears' quarterback is, in fact, Jewish bringing in 77 of the last 100 page views recorded by SiteMeter.</p>
