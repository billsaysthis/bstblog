<p>At the urging of my fellow SpoFites, I broke down and entered the <a href="http://fantasy.premierleague.com/index.html">EPL Fantasy League</a> for the upcoming season. I've never played any fantasy sports before and have no clue if I picked a decent group of players, but here is the lineup for BillSaysThisSCORES!! (we were asked to include our user names in the team name, or something like that).</p>
<p>In goal, I have the great American keeper Brad Friedel of the Blackburn Rovers. My back line is Liverpool's Sami Hyypia (Finnish international) and Norwegian international John Arne Riise, Manchester United's young comer John O'Shea (English national team), and Northern Ireland Under-21 international Mark Clyde of the newly promoted Wolverhampton. In midfield are Everton's Danish international Thomas Gravesen, Birmingham's Welsh international Robbie Savage, Blackburn's Turkish international Kerimoglu Tugay, and Newcastle's Jermaine Jenas.</p>
<p>Up front are Liverpool's goal scoring machine and English national team star Michael Owen and Australian international Mark Viduka of Leeds. On the substitute bench I have the number two American goalkeeper Kasey Keller, Fullham striker Luis Boa Morte (Portuguese international), Leicester's Northern Ireland international Gerrie Taggart for defense, and Wolverhamptons' midfielder Kevin Cooper. Of my 15 players, only one does not feature for his national team, and that one is my substitute midfielder. Not bad, I guess, but since I don't really understand how the scoring works, I was happy just to get 15 players from my allotted 100 points.</p>
<p>Let me say upfront that I don't much care for the UI design on this site but I will do my best to kick butt on the others, because I SCORE!!</p>
