<p>Another TiVo Suggestion, seemed cute and for some reason more appealing than other available shows. Plus Evan Rachel Wood has gotten much good press for <a href="http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/thirteen/">thirteen</a> and I thought I see what this one held. 2001's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0296845/">Little Secrets</a> is, I have to say, a great movie for young girls: it's smart, not smarmy, fun and has a couple of cute boys; Wood and her friends learn a valuable lesson in the end, of course, and in a fair way. But unless you're a parent watching with your under-14 daughter, it really isn't that much fun to sit through.</p>
