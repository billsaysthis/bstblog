<p>My boss Ofer and I have made our way to Seattle for <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com">Gnomedex 6.0</a>. I'm really looking forward to an unconference couple of days since Chris Pirillo and Ponzi have developed a reputation for putting together a very different kind of tech event--this year even has a <a href="http://www.penmachine.com/2006/06/free-mp3-theme-song-for-gnomedex-for.html">theme song</a> from Derek Miller. Plus cool parties are on for Friday and Saturday nights, making me wish I'd thought more carefully before booking a return flight right after the event ends Saturday.</p>
<p>John Edwards, Kerry's running mate, is giving the keynote but promises to speak about the political implications and uses of technology rather than a standard stump speech. Also sure to be interesting are Amazon's            <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/">Werner Vogels</a>, <a href="http://susanmernit.blogspot.com/">Susan Mernitt</a>, <a href="http://www.pud.com">Pud "Fucked Company" Kaplan</a>, <a href="http://www.factoryjoe.net/blog">Chris Messina</a>, <a href="http://www.blakeross.com/">Blake Ross</a> of Mozilla, the lively and helpful Jeremy Zawodny and <a href="http://halleyscomment.blogspot.com/">Halley Suitt</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Scoble will be making his first post-Microsoft appearance--dude, Half Moon Bay is beautiful but I sure hope you enjoy slow driving over long, twisty, one lane mountain roads. <a href="http://laughingsquid.com/">Scott Beale</a> is also up from the Bay Area so we're sure to get tons of good photos.</p>
<p>Of course I miss my sweetie.</p>
