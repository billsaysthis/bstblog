<p>Specifically, in response to the vote this past week and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/07/opinion/l07gay.html?ex=1249617600&amp;en=24170634508ed504&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">these Letters to the Editor</a> in today's Times:</p>
<p>Many reject the comparison but, as a married Caucasian heterosexual, the civil rights campaigns of 40 years ago perfectly resonate with the efforts to expand marriage to all today. Indeed, the recent vote in Missouri is an excellent example: Had a similar poll been take there in 1964, or 1954, does anyone doubt that non-White citizens would have been denied what reforms they sought?</p>
<p>Further, I find odd the continuing focus by the self-described pro traditional marriage forces on allowing homosexuals and lesbians into the club. If the needs of successful one man/one woman marriages are to be embodied in our laws and even Constitutions, why are such enemies as adultery and premarital sex not part of their legal agenda? The ultimate source of their position on this matter, the Bible, certainly explicitly condemns those acts as well but I wonder how well these supporters would fare on those grounds.<br /></p>
