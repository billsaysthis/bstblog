<p>That Saha saga I related <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_01_11_blog_archive.phtml#107410759234903909">the other day</a>? As expected, Fullham has come to their senses and taken the &#163;12M transfer fee and ManU will be even stronger across the frontline now that Louis has <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/headlinenews?id=289043&amp;cc=5901">passed his physical</a>.</p>
<p>Several American players have now jumped to the EPL and Europe in this window. In fact, Saha will be replaced in the Cottagers' lineup by Brian McBride after the team beat a $2M transfer fee offer from Blackburn Rovers; the 31 year old McBride is leaving behind the Columbus Crew for a salary that is more than $1M higher plus an opportunity to really show his scoring touch. Forward Clint Mathis is going to Germany, joining Hannover 96 of the Bundesliga after four years with the MetroStars, on a free transfer since he was out of contract; Hannover already has fellow American national team member Steve Cherundolo on their squad.</p>
