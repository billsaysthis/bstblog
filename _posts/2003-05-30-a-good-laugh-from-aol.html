<p>"WASTE is a software product and protocol that enables secure distributed communication for small (on the order of 10-50 nodes) trusted groups of users." That was the message posted on AOL subsidiary NullSoft website yesterday. Got a <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/05/29#When:11:19:21AM">lot</a> of <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/05/29/0140241">favorable play</a>.</p>
<p>But apparently pissed off someone higher up in the corporate foodchain, who <a href="http://rss.com.com/2100-1032_3-1011585.html?type=pt&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=news">had it pulled</a>. "The quiet launch of Waste was the work of Nullsoft's principal developer, Justin Frankel, a soft-spoken 20-something known for his tech savvy and his streak of rebelliousness." Frankel pulled a similar stunt a couple of years ago which gave the world Gnutella and all it's cousins, so the outcome this time ought to be interesting, at least.</p>
<p>WASTE <a href="http://www.nullsoft.com/free/waste/">download page</a> as of Friday, 4:30 PST: "An unauthorized copy of Nullsoft's copyrighted software was briefly posted on this website...The posting of the Software on this website was not authorized by Nullsoft....If you downloaded or otherwise obtained a copy of the Software, you acquired no lawful rights to the Software and must destroy any and all copies of the Software, including by deleting it from your computer."</p>
<p>For now at least, WASTE can be downloaded from a <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/blogs/gems/home/waste.zip">Harvard webserver</a>, though this archive seems to be the C language source files (with some docs and ancillary material) and not a compiled executable.</p>
