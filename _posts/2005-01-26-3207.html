<p>Pam's <a href="http://www.pamslife.com/2005_01_01_archives.html#110662570595368016">posted another great tune</a>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Roses are Black</span>, an original tune featuring her piano playing and vocals with very fitting, simple backing on bass and drums (I understand steel pedal is likely to be added in the near future). Check it out!<br /></p>
