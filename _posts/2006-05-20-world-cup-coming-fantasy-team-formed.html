<p>With 20 days until the opening kickoff of <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/">FIFA World Cup 2006</a>, it's time to jump into the fantasy team planning. I finished fourth in the SportsFilter Premiership fantasy league and would love to improve on that for the biggest tournament on th eplanet. The <a href="http://en.fifaworldcup.fantasysports.yahoo.com/">FIFA fantasy site</a> seems different than all the other sites I've played on because there's no player budget and I could simply select the best players, but only three from any one squad. So no just clicking all the Brazilians.</p>
<p>Here's my starting 11, at least for now:</p>
<p>Forwards: Thierry Henry (France, Arsenal), Lionel Messi (Argentine, Barcelona), Emmanuel Adebayor (Togo, Arsenal)</p>
<p>Midfielders: Ronaldinho (Brazil, Barcelona), Kaka (Brazil, AC Milan), Frank Lampard (England, Chelsea), Damarcus Beasley (USA, PSV Eindhoven)</p>
<p>Defenders: Gabriel Heinze (Argentina, Manchester United), Rafael Marquez (Mexico, Barcelona), Ashley Cole (England, Arsenal)</p>
<p>Goalkeeper: Petr Cech (Czech Republic, Chelsea)</p>
<p>Man, this is gonna be fun!</p>
