<p>Not better than the one <a href="http://rob.crabapples.net/2006/11/bill-weasleys-birthday.htm">JK Rowling gave him</a>. So I'll just send Rob Fahrni my best wishes on his latest birthday. Maybe she can give him another one next year by not killing off Harry in the last volume of her epic series.</p>
