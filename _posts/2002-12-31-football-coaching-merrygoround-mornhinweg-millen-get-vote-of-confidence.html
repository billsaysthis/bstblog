<p>Despite a 0-16 road record (5-27 overall), coach Marty Mornhinweg and president Matt Millen have been <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2002/1231/1485131.html">given a third year</a> by owner William Clay Ford to run the Detroit Lions. Why would be a good question but you know that kind of honesty will not be forthcoming. Maybe Ford figured he'll make the same money anyway, from attendance and TV, and won't have to buy out expensive contracts.</p>
