<p>Last year I <a href="http://www.sportsfilter.com/lockerroom/comments.cfm/520">finished second</a>, by one measly point, in our knockout stages only SportsFilter competition. This year we're starting from the beginning, or at least the earliest <a href="http://en.uclfantasy.uefa.com/">the UEFA site</a> allows, and I've set up a league called SportsFilter. Even if you aren't a SpoFite, feel free to show your skills by joining our little competition.<br /></p>
