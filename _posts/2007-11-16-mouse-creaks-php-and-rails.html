<p>The Lab here at BST has been humming the last couple of weeks, though much of the work is not yet ready for public view. Our head man has also been interviewing for an exciting opportunity at a very cool small startup and we hope to post good news about his new 'day job' soon; for now let's just say it involves building a new kind of community engagement model for a disruptive SAAS company.</p>
<p>We're also building a small, er, highly opinionated website content system in PHP for a consulting client. The system is essentially the fifth or sixth iteration of the page template class code used here on billsaysthis.com but forked to handle pure HTML page fragments as well as PHP-driven content where appropriate (e.g., the real data is in MySQL) since a web designer is partnering on the engagement.</p>
<p>This code can also be available to you at a very reasonable cost.</p>
<p>We're also taking another pass at a small Ruby on Rails project to get a sense of the improvements in <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/11/9/rails-2-0-release-candidate-1">the forthcoming 2.0 release</a>. So far so good and with some possibility of posting this as a free to use public web application before New Year's Day. Open source? Maybe, though the executive committee here has questions about how interesting the code might be to other developers and very much about the time commitment this would create.</p>
<p>And then there's the big vacation starting tomorrow too.</p>
