<p><b>Today's movie: Shane</b></p>
<p>In this 1953 Academcy Award nominated film, Alan Ladd plays the loner who walks in and saves the day. George Steven's <a href="http://www.filmsite.org/shan.html">Shane</a> is considered one of the <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=quintessential">quintessential</a> movie westerns pitting ranchers against homesteaders in 1880s Wyoming. This could be simplistic but reaches deep to make the bad guy understandable--although the rancher is shown ordering murders he also gets an excellent speech explaining how he came to his position--and brilliantly uses a young boy to focus us tightly on Ladd's stoic hero. Hollywood gets its material from elsewhere and in the case of most westerns, that source was <a href="http://history.acusd.edu/gen/west/turner.html">Frederick Jackson Turner</a>, a historian who argued that the continuously receeding western frontier was the central story of America in the 19th century.</p>
