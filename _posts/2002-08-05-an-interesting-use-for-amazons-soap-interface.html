<p><a href="http://nuitari.serv.net/~flare/amazon-similarities-map/index.cgi?a=display-sims&amp;asin=0345348109">This page</a>, oddly uncredited to anyone, uses the recently released <a href="http://associates.amazon.com/exec/panama/associates/ntg/browse/-/1067662/104-5174397-2745537">Amazon SOAP interface</a> to create graphs which show how Amazon links books together. Click on the Home link at the bottom and you can enter other titles, or click on any title on this graph to get a Similarity map for that book. I would print an example chart here but they tend to be a too large and a thumbnail would be of little value. Very interesting, but beware that it could lead to hours of mindless exploration.</p>
