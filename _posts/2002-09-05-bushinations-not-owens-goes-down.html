<p>Some months ago, pseudo-President Bush nominated <a href="5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals">Priscilla Owens</a> to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Fortunately for you, me, and the rest of America, the Senate Judiciary committee today defeated her nomination by voting along strict party lines not to send her name on to the full Senate for consideration. Ms. Owens is currently a Texas Supreme Court Justice, put there by Bush when he pretended to be governor, and a ridiculously (perhaps to the point of subconcious self-hatred) conservative person. <em>Phew!</em></p>
