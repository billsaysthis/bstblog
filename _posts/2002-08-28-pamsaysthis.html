<p>My friend Pam was also at Compaq Center last night and had this to say:</p>
<p>Not only did Springsteen walk a perfectly balanced line of old and new, cry of tough times and heartfelt hopes, frustrations and furious flaming love, but the energy level demonstrated by someone who has done this as long as he has was amazing. Patti Scialfa is the luckiest chick in the whole entire *world.*  He also refrained from the maudlin overuse of red, white and blue on the hats and t-shirts, as opposed to the Born in the USA tour, which I sort of appreciated. It was brave to do 41 Shots on this tour; again, a strikingly balanced posture. The asymmetric harmonies on Empty Sky were haunting -- the gritty, searing blend of Bruce and Patti's voices was inspiring of memories built to last. What was really neat was seeing the teenagers mouth all the words to all the songs in the setlist, alongside their parents. It's that kind of reach that must hold the most appeal for the band.</p>
