<p>Today is <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~kim9999/gbday.html">Garret's Birthday!</a>, but no, not that Garret. For starters, the man I'm celebrating has an <a href="http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/caps.htm">ee cummings fetish</a> and never uses capital letters. Not to mention our boy is 43 and no longer young enough to get the children's discount for movies. Last year, Dan <a href="http://thetimesink.net/Blog/Archives/Blog011012.html" title="No per item permalinks, just scroll down">wished him HB</a> with a bottled fart.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com">garret</a> is such a nice guy that even in the depths of inebriation he remembers to <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/posts/01/20011016">send congrats</a> to <a href="http://www.bump.net/">others</a> born on his day.</p>
<p>I highly recommend his <a href="http://dangerous.phpwebhosting.com/ngallery/">excellent photography</a>! Not to mention his high quality, high volume daily linkage--to me he is the epitome of the link (as opposed to <a href="http://denbeste.nu">commentary</a>) bloggers.</p>
<p>Someday I hope to travel to the exotic Santa Fe and meet this man.</p>
