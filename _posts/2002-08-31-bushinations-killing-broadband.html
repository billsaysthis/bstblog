<p><a href="http://www.tnr.com/showBio.mhtml?pid=26">John Judis</a>, in the New Republic, writes about another aspect of the Bush Administration's <a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20020902&amp;s=judis090202">corporate welfare programs</a>: broadband duopolies and the man behind them, FCC chairman Michael (I'm Colin's son) Powell. Judis begins by showing Powell's hypocrisy. The chairman says that widespread consumer adoption of broadband Internet access is key to the revivial of our telecom industry, and competition is the key to such adoption, but he's pushing the FCC to make rules that eliminate competition to the Baby Bells and cable companies. Wow, that makes so much sense!</p>
