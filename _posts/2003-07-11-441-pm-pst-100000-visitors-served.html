<p>Today was a bit of a milestone here at the BillSaysThis offices when, after nearly two years of monitoring, our visitor counter flipped over into the sixth digit. The management refused to issue an official statement although peeping toms in the parking lot remarked that they heard some distinctive "W00T W00T" shouting when the momentous event occured. Thanks to Google for all the traffic, without that massive server farm and its referrals, we don't know where we'd be. Mom said, "Congratulations. So when will you hit a million?" Thanks Mom.</p>
