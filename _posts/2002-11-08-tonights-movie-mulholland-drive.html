<p>Tivo used the following description of this film: "An aspiring actress in Los Angeles for an audition with a young director helps the amnesiac victim of an automobile accident." Now, I realize they have limited space but that's about the least useful description I can imagine for this one. At first, I was going to end this write up with the previous two sentences but I'll go a little deeper.</p>
<p>Simply put, <a href="http://www.mulhollanddrive.com/switchboard.htm">Mulholland Drive</a> is one of the stranger movies of the past few years. Compelling, raw, surreal, emotional, vivid, sensual, sure, but strange. I couldn't even begin to explain the plot to you. Things happen on screen, and they seem to be connected to each other, like a word that's just on the tip of your tongue but you can't say it. As <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/ebert/ebert_reviews/2001/10/101205.html">Roger Ebert said</a> (in his 4 star review): "The movie is a surrealist dreamscape in the form of a Hollywood film noir, and the less sense it makes, the more we can't stop watching it." Such a response is completely expected since the film was written and directed by David Lynch (Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, The Elephant Man).</p>
<p>Naomi Watts (currently in theaters with The Ring) and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/EGallery?source=ss&amp;group=0166924&amp;photo=MDCL1536X1024_2.jpg&amp;path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Harring,+Laura+Elena">Laura Elena Harring</a> (she'll be co-starring in next year's remake of Willard) play the lead roles and Lynch demands, and gets, excellent performances from both. There are, by the way, a few lesbian scenes between the two, hot though not as much as a friend of mine claimed. The women play actresses and the plot(?) also involves a director played by Justin Theroux--yeah, who is he--and Monty Montgomery as Cowboy, who has one of the more memorable lines, which is spoken to Theroux's Adam: "Now, you will see me one more time if you do good. You'll see me two more times if you do bad. Goodnight." Another actress earlier in the film is shown playing a character named Camilla Rhodes, and then towards the end, Harring plays an actress named Camilla Rhodes. Watts is introduced as Betty Elms, then later plays Diane Selwyn.</p>
<p>Don't expect to understand this, just go along with the flow and you should enjoy it. Perhaps if you read the Ebert review linked above you can get a better sense of the film though I doubt it.</p>
