<p><b>Yesterday's TV: Sopranos Season Finale</b><br />

<p>Oh well, another 13 episodes in the can and a year or so until the next batch show up. As the NY Daily News writes, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/2001-05-21/New_York_Now/Television/a-111912.asp">'Sopranos' Finale a Hit</a> and that may be true but to me the season ender was good, tight, and worth watching but <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/television/tvco05212001.htm">not satisfying as the season's finale</a>.</p>
