<p>[Sent to the hosts and program director at The Bone but of course there was no response from them.]<br />
<br />&nbsp;<br />
<br />As I've gotten older, I've come to realize that much of what we call humor involves pain but only when that pain is another person's. Fair enough, I suppose. This morning's routine, however, where <a href="http://www.1077thebone.com/jocks/lnt/">Lamont and Tonelli</a> called a father to tell him his 12 year old son was busted for pot was just too much.</p>
<p>I really enjoy the music your station plays (though you could add more Springsteen) but today makes me realize you have no limits. I can only imagine the pain you put this guy through--short of death or serious injury there's hardly anything worse for the parent of a 12 year old child!--just to entertain listeners. That's sick, seriously sick, and I have to say I pushed the button for KFOG immediately.</p>
<p>I know that the victim of these jokes is called back a few minutes later and told the truth but what gives you the right to inflict such anguish? The other week I heard the hosts calling a woman to tell her about her husband or boyfriend fathering a child by another woman, again this terrible, but a perfect example of how you've gone off the rails.</p>
<p>Isn't there enough pain and hurt and anguish in our world today without you adding to it intentionally? With all the experience of your team in radio, can't you find a better routine for Friday mornings? Maybe you could just play more good music and leave the obnoxious chatter to <a title="KFOG's even worse, never shuts up morning show host" href="http://www.kfox.com/earlyshow.html">Greg Kihn</a>?<br /></p>
