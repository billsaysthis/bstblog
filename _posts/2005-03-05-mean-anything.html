<p>I am a member of a "weird community of people," according to Carson Daly on last night's <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Last_Call_with_Carson_Daly/">Last Call</a>, since I blog. Then again if you're reading this so are you. This was the second late night show this week to poke fun at us: <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/thedailyshowwithjonstewart/index.jhtml">The Daily Show</a> had a pretty funny bit with <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/thedailyshowwithjonstewart/corr_corddry.jhtml">Rob Corddry</a> on Thursday. Not surprisingly Corddry was funnier.</p>
