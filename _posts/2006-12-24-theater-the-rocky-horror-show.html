<p>TS1 found this while looking for something to do on New Year's Eve, I'm not sure how. But I highly recommend if you have a free night between now and January 6, spend the $20 a ticket and drive over to San Jose to see Actors Theater Center's stage production of <a href="http://www.theatrecenter.biz/index.html">The Rocky Horror Show</a>. We had a terrific time, the cast is very good and the show is in a cozy little theater next to a middle school.</p>
<p>Before I lived out here I used to go to shows fairly often, on Broadway, off Broadway and <a href="http://www.papermill.org/papermill.html">the Paper Mill Playhouse</a> (a, it's the official state theater of New Jersey and b, the original building <span style="font-style:italic;">was</span> a paper mill, okay?), my parents being quite the devotees of the stage. Out here, not being a huge fan of driving up to San Francisco and the ridiculous ticket prices for big name shows (we checked into seeing <span style="font-style:italic;">Jersey Boys</span> and the cheapest seats worth buying are $90 each, and that's before the TicketMaster fees).</p>
<p>These days people may not remember that this was originally a stage production in London and the movie wasn't made until two years later (though Tim Curry was the star of both). Director Jeff Hicks has done a nice job of translating it back and local theater vet Tad M. Morgan is a hoot as Frank N. Furter and David Cori does a perfect job as the narrator, handling the traditional audience responses especially well. After the curtain call, the whole cast lead the audience in doing the <span style="font-style:italic;">Time Warp</span> (again).</p>
<p>It's been a long time but I used to be a regular at the Friday midnight movie shows back in college and this was a fun time warp. If you're still looking for a different way to ring in the New Year, this is a good bet.</p>
