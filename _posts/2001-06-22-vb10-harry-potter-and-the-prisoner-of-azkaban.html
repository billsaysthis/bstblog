<p>Another bad summer leading into an eventful, villainous third year at Hogwarts School. But author J.K. Rowling has maintained the humor and inventiveness so that the repetitive story elements provide a framework instead of leading to boredom. I'm certainly curious to find out how well she's done in the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_08_05_blog_archive.phtml#5023633" title="My writeup">fourth novel</a>. Rowland also spends, to good effect, some effort on character development, so that we aren't stuck in an unchanging Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew world.</p>
