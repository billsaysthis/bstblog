<p>Six years ago tonight TS1 and I stood up in front of family and friends to pledge our love and lives together. Simply put, I've never made a better decision: no woman is a better match for me and she gives me hope that the future will be ever better.</p>

<p>For all of you still searching for a partner in life I wish only that you find someone as wonderful as Viv!</p>
