<p><b>Today's Book: Steady Eddie</b>
<p>It's the mid-70s again and 19 year old Eddie is sliding through life on beer, weed, and his buddy Loopy. Bonus points: Eddie is a Springsteen fan. Author T. Glen Coughlin lives in the Jersey suburbs but he paints a strong portrait of life on the wrong side of Long Island in this <a href="http://www.sohopress.com/steadyeddie.html">second novel</a>, throwing Eddie enough loops to twist his life completely around. Well-written coming of life story, a good change of pace from the military/SF I've been reading lately.</p>
