<p>Well, LittleSteven <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2005_05_22_blog_archive.phtml#111703851762723615">needed</a> ANOTHER new hard drive but this time Fry's was able to pull one from in-store stock and get the machine back later the same day. Not that the process was without absurd pain due to the legendary chain's craptacular internal computer systems, no I wasn't that lucky. Not to mention the hours of work reinstalling everything from WinXP Pro with all its service packs and critical fixes to Firefox and its extensions. Thanks once again to AJSystem's <a href="http://www.ajsystems.com/ezb.html">EazyBackup</a> for saving my bacon. What I want to know is how the hell did I get such a lemon from a manufacturer with a reputation as good as Toshiba has?</p>
