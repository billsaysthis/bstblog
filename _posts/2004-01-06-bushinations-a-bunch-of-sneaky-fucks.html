<p>Harsh language to use about our president and his trusted advisors, for sure, but what else can you call them <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/privacy/0,1848,61792,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_1">when they sneak</a> civils rights destroying provisions into barely visible legislation on the <em>same day</em> last month that the media and everyone else was preoccupied with the capture of Saddam Hussein? The TFH types claimed that we'd captured Hussein well in advance of that day so that everything could be prepared just so but were dismissed as raving lunatics; now, though, I start to wonder. The legislation grants the FBI unprecedented power to obtain records from financial institutions without requiring permission from a judge and was originally part of the Patriot Act II--which was defeated when people realized how seriously bad it was. Sneaky fucks, all right.</p>
