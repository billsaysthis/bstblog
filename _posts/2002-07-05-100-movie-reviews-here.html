<p>I just noticed that the previous post reviewing American Outlaws was the 100th movie review I've posted to BillSaysThis, according to <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/entertain/moviereviews.phtml">the movie review index</a>. The first one was for <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_03_25_blog_archive.phtml#2993070">Almost Famous</a> on March 30th of last year although I admit that wasn't much of a review. Guess I needed to find my style. Still, 100 movies in about 15 months is a decent total. And if Hollywood would make decent films more often...</p>
