<p>I'd never heard about <a href="http://ddickerson.igc.org/cliffords-tower.html">Clifford's Tower</a> before. This was "the most horrifying event in the history of English Jewry," a night in 1190 when the Jews of York where massacred, simply for being Jewish. Something that's been hard down through the ages, right up to today.</p>
