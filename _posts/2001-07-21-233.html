<p><b>I do not look like this</b><br />

<p>For those of you wise/foolish enough to search in, say, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22bill+lazar%22">Google for me</a> and happen across an article about Silicon Valley College, <a href="http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/02.08.01/gifs/svcollege1-0106.jpg">this picture</a> is NOT ME! It's another Bill Lazar who lives in Sunnyvale. I have never lived in Sunnyvale, I do not have a receeding hairline (at least not yet), and I am not completely, or even largely, gray.</p>
<p>Nor am I the (now deceased) <a href="http://www.luxorcab.com/html/history.html">former president of the Luxor Cab Company</a> of San Francisco.</p>
<p>Nor am I associated with the <a href="http://www.guidestar.org/search/report/gs-report.adp?ein=13-6088182">Lazar Foundation</a> of Portland, OR, although its mission is one I would favor: to support environmental groups and research in the Pacific Northwest. In 1999 (latest year available), the foundation made 91 grants totalling $835,005. The Lazar Foundation was founded in 1959. <i>Cool!</i></p>
<p>I am, however, the co-author of <a href="http://www.bestbookdeal.com/cgi-bin/detail.cgi?isbn=0672305666&amp;subcat=DVO">CA-Visual Objects Developer's Guide</a> with <a href="http://redbacksweb.com/">Gary Stark</a> and Carl Ganz. However, this book was published in 1995 and is waaaaay out of date, so don't buy it even if you can find a copy.</p>
