<p>Four LFC players <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/england/news/2002/0902/20020902engsquad.html">were named</a> to the England team (of 20 players) which will face Portugal on Saturday in a friendly, a warm-up for the Euro 2004 qualifying round: Danny Murphy, Stephen Gerrard, Emile Heskey, and Michael Owen. Given Heskey's in and out status in the first three Premiership matches, this is somewhat surprising but national team coach Sven Goran Eriksson was somewhat limited in his choice of strikers due to various injuries. I'm looking forward to today's match against Newcastle in a couple of hours and then the rest of the Reds are off for nine days as this weekend is devoted to international play.</p>
