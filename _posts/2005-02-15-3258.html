<p>Bob Lutz of GM makes another first in the blogging world by publishing the first formal availability announcement of a new autombile in a blog: <a href="http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/archives/2005/02/the_promise_of.html">The Promise of Solstice</a>. Looks like a potential success for Pontiac if the car delivers in terms of quality, as the <a href="http://www.pontiac.com/fuelingzone/index.jsp?deepLink=solstice&amp;brand=home">stats are very good</a>. A sporty convertible with a sticker under $20k (barely, but including destination charge), 177 HP, 18-inch wheels, glass rear window and a CD player.</p>
