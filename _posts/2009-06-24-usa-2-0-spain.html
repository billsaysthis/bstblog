<p>For those of you who somehow managed to avoid seeing this result, how did you do it? LOL.
<div></div>
<div>For me beating the world numero uno, 15 straight wins, 35 straight undefeated La Furia Roja is one of the greatest results in USA team history. Right up there with beating Mexico in the 2002 World Cup round of 16 and the wins over Brazil and Portugal.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Spain completely dominated possession, shots on goal and the US even finished a player down. Tim Howard, the back four and midfield were outstanding in defense, I'm hardpressed to pick between Howard, Oguchi Onyewu and Jay Demerit for Man of the Match. Landon Donovan was everywhere today, playing at the outstanding level he showed before his disastrous spell at Bayern Leverkusen and MLS return with the Galaxy.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Livingston's own Jozy Altidore had the first goal, matching strength against Joan Capdevilla and winning. Landon and Dempsey combined for the second, nice close in work inside Spain's six yard box. Both times $150 million-rated keeper Iker Casillas could do no more than get fingertips to the ball.</div>
<div></div>
<div>USA also suffered again at the hands of referee Jorge Lariondo. This clown was horrendous at the 2006 World Cup, sending off two Americans in our game against Italy. He was below average but not terrible until inexplicably pulling a red card out against Michael Bradley in the 87th minute. FIFA must, I mean MUST, revoke his international license.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We may lose big to Brazil again on Sunday--but no one can fairly say the USA hasn't earned their place in the final.</div>
