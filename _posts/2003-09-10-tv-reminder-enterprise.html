<p>In case you haven't been paying attention, tonight is the third season premiere of <a href="http://www.stenterprise.com/">Star Trek Enterprise</a> on your local UPN channel at 8:00; now you have no excuse not to see it. Archer, T'Pol (featuring even sexier new outfits!), and the crew are joined by a squad of MACOs as they search the deadly dangerous Expanse for the alien Xindi. Wipe out the Xindi before they wipe us out!</p>
