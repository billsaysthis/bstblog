<p>I can't believe <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/Assistance/2000/Out2ksecFAQ.aspx">this</a>! Outlook (2000 SR-1) adds a so-called security feature that blocks email attachments with certain extensions (generally, extensions that indicate executables) and there just is no way around this blockage. I mean what the fuck? Are we all to be treated as children now because Microsoft doesn't think we can make decisions on our own? A programmer friend sent me a little utility and we couldn't understand what was happening, why I couldn't get this copied off. Finally he had to re-send it as a Zip file, which just goes to show that this Microsoft decision adds security only on paper. Evangelize this, <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scoble</a>, and explain why of all the MS bloggers, none are on the Outlook/Office team.</p>
