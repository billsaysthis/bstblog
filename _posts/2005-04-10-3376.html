<p>The New York Times has a brief interview with Steve Van Zandt, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/10/business/worldbusiness/10boss.html?ex=1270785600&amp;en=ea6e8de8c1dd0300&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland" title="Misleading title, Bruce is not involved in the article">The Boss: A Rocker Redux</a>, about how many years in the music business it took him to understand the money side. Probably would have been different, taken less time, if his (amazingly underrated!) solo records had sold better.</p>
