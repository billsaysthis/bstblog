<p><b>Flangy is undecided on the big Krispy Kreme opening</b></p>
<p>Adam says he might ride out for the big sore opening or <a href="http://theflangynews.editthispage.com/2001/10/29">then again, maybe not</a>, linking to a <a href="http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis/web/vortex/display?slug=kremestampede29m&amp;date=20011029&amp;query=krispy+kreme">Seattle Times article</a> pointing out that off-duty police will be there keeping order. I say go, what could be more fun than the anticipatory line <a href="http://www.2020hindsight.org/2001/10/29.html">smelling those tasty pastries</a> hot off the oven! Certainly not waiting weeks in line for a movie. Paul is so taken with the little tasties he's started a <a href="http://mynakada.weblogs.com/stories/storyReader$94">Bay Area Krispy Kreme page</a>. I know a certain friend of mine, diet or not, has a tough time resisting a quick half dozen on the way home from the office; he's in big trouble when the <a href="http://www.krispykreme.com/opening1_CA.htm">Daly City store opens</a> in two weeks.</p>
