<p>Up in suburban Oregon, the locals are up in arms! Shouting mad because some people planned to <a href="http://www.newsregister.com/news/story.cfm?story_no=193114">throw a sex party</a> just outside their fair town last night. The organizer arranged for the use of a bar outside Sheridan city limits (in unincorporated county area), meaning he's not shoving some spectacle in their faces, but that's not good enough for some folks in our so-called Land of the Free. One can only imagine what they'd say about <a href="http://www.blaserco.com/blogs/2005/05/01.html#a345">Britt Blaser's announcement</a> but nothing good I'm sure. Frank Rich <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/opinion/01rich.html?ex=1272600000&amp;en=cbe029680674c5a3&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">analyzes the sentiment</a> from a more blatantly political angle.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, <a href="http://scripting.com">Happy Birthday Dave</a>, thanks for the Blaser link, good on ya for another 30, 50 or more.</p>
