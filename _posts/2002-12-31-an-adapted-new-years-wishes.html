<p>"Geez, Stu, we're supposed to have this greeting down already--it has to go out on the wires before midnight! What we're we thinking, taking this job on. But that woman, she <a href="http://a88.g.akamai.net/f/88/606/1d/image.pathfinder.com/people/images/features/reviews/021216/adaptation.jpg">sure is hot</a>. She can convince us to do anything."</p>
<p>"Bro, you are way to high strung! How did we ever get to be twins?"</p>
<p>"Oh that helps a lot! Come on, sit down and let's get to work on this message. We need to cut <a href="http://www.readinggroupguides.com/guides/orchid_thief.asp">284 pages</a> down into a moving, snappy greeting."</p>
<p>"Arggh! Okay, write this down: 2003, gonna be lots o' loving, hope you get yours!"</p>
<p>"Please, be serious. We can't send that out to anyone. Man, I just now we're going to miss the deadline. Just because you sweep into town and sell one lousy script, you think you know everything."</p>
<p>"Whatever. At least I'm getting laid. Man, those starlets can be yummy."</p>
<p>"Focus already. And don't forget I <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Pawards?Kaufman,%20Charlie">won an Oscar</a> for <em>my</em> <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120601">first movie</a>."</p>
<p>"Sure, I know. And, hey, I do love you bro. Here's our greeting:</p>
<p>"From Bill and Stu to everyone: Happy New Year, and may 2003 be better be happier, more satisfying, and more joyful than any year you've already lived!"</p>
