<p><b>Today's movie: Cinema Paradiso</b><br />

<p>I spent a sleepy, lazy afternoon watching <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/ebert/ebert_reviews/1990/03/536555.html">Cinema Paradiso</a> on cable and it was definitely worthwhile. A <a href="http://srd.yahoo.com/goo/cinema+paradiso/13/*http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Nuovo%20cinema%20Paradiso%20(1988)">movie</a> that is, to paraphrase a friend, both sweet and tender at the same time. Roger Ebert sums up the appeal: "Yet anyone who loves movies is likely to love "Cinema Paradiso." This is the story of a boy projectionist living on Sicily in the years after World War II and his substitute father, the real projectionist (powerful performance by <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Noiret,+Philippe">Philippe Noiret</a>); this film won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 1990</p>
