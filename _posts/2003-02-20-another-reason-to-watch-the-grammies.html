<p>True, most awards shows are simply painful to watch, and that includes the Grammies most years. Sunday night's event holds the prospect of standing above that threshold, though. Already anticipated is the performance of Springsteen and the E St. Band, probably <i>Waiting on a Sunny Day</i>, and the tribute to Joe Strummer. Now, and I'm not saying this is news, only new to me, is that Simon &amp; Garfunkle will be performing together. Only one song, probably <i>Bridge Over Troubled Water</i> (oh yes, please!!!), but the long-separated duo are <a href="http://www.thisislondon.com/news/showbiz/articles/3492775?source=Evening%20Standard">also negotiating</a> to reunite for a Summer tour.</p>
