<p><b>Eric Clapton Royally sucks ass</b></p>
<p>An ongoing series, <a href="http://www.ugo.com/channels/animation/heavy/">Behind The Music That Sucks</a> tears Eric Clapton to shreds in a new episode. In this excellent use of Flash director Andy Smith, writer Conor Lynch, and music composer Jared Gutstadt use a <a href="http://www.filmsite.org/cloc.html">Clockwork Orange</a> framework ("Hello, my droogies"), Mick Jagger leads the first brainwashing forcing Clapton watch hours and hours of American Bandstand to switch to his soft rock crap (then Clapton goes on Oprah, who we see in panties with her curly hairs showing) Barbra Streisand and James Taylor doing a second brainwashing forcing Clapton to watch streams of Full House episodes, and what appears to be a third brainwashing by blues masters including B.B. King but turns out to be just a serious ass kicking. A good bit of very funny original parody music is featured. Other musicians/groups featured in past episodes include Brittney (I watched this episode and it's damn funny too), J. Lo, Garth Brooks, Glenn Miller, William Shatner, and Guns N Roses.</p>
