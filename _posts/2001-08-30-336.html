<p><b>Today's books: Star Trek Maximum Warp (Books 1 and 2)</b></p>
<p>Decent adventure, bringing in the Romulans, Klingons, and, of course, Picard and the Enterprise. Another case of Paramount grasping at the money by splitting what should have been one novel into two parts, though. I hate it but I can't help myself. For a real review, check out what <a href="http://www.treknation.com/reviews/maximum_warp.shtml">Michelle Erica Green wrote</a> on the Trek Nation site. Let's just say someone is messing with the primal nature of space itself, creating dead zones where higher forms of energy (like warp propulsion) don't work, and Picard must work with Spock (yeah, cool) and a Romulan scientist to save all of existence.</p>
