<p>Ah well, so much for StevieG and co. 120 minutes without giving up or scoring a goal, 60 at 10 men after Rooney's ridiculous groin stamping and petulance (would have a been a yellow if the boy'd walked away), only to lose because their PKs were absurdly weak. Portugal didn't really earn the win, barely taking advantage of the extra man, but Ricardo did the necessary in goal and CRonaldo made lots of pretty dives before putting in the winner.</p>
<p>Let's just say Brazil do in France. That gives us Germany-Italy on Tuesday and Portugal-Brazil Wednesday, I'll pick Italy and Brazil for the final and Brazil winning for the third time in four.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Later:</span> Well, having seen the final score but not the match, I guess the Brazil <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2006_06_25_blog_archive.phtml#115142556908098041">I suggested the other day</a> didn't play terribly well against Ghana showed up today and so the samba ended a week early. I don't have a great feel for France or Portugal in their semi-final, but am now leaning towards the Germany-Italy winner taking home the trophy. Though my track record should warn you against putting money down on it.</p>
