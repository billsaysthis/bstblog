<p>I sent this today to my Congressperson, Anna Eshoo, after reading <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/03/congressional_t.html">Congressional Testimony on the TSA</a>:</p>
<p>Congresswoman Eshoo,</p>
<p>I was extremely disappointed to read that Bruce Schneier was removed AT THE REQUEST OF THE TSA the from the witness list of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's hearing on the successes and challenges associated with Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT), the Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques (SPOT) program, the Transportation Worker Credential Card (TWIC), and other security initiatives administered by the TSA.</p>
<p>As a senior member of Congress I hope you will make every effort to reverse this blatantly self-serving ploy by the TSA to avoid an embarrassing public airing of their poor, possibly corrupt work.</p>
<p>I'm not a person who thinks the Federal government can do nothing right, I've always voted for Democrats and try to avoid conspiracy theories. However I do feel the TSA has generally been a monumental waste of money, producing trivial results at huge cost in money and inconvenience.</p>
<p>Again I hope you will use your office to have Bruce Schneier, one of America's greatest resources on real security, testify for the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and further to help improve our government by bringing about a total reform of the TSA.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Bill Lazar<br />
