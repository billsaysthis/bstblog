<p>For the first time in a long time, with the possible exception of the most recent Mustang, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/news/car_news.phtml">I've seen</a> an affordable American car that looks hot: the <a href="http://www.saturn.com/saturn/showroom/future_vehicles/sky_hi/index.jsp?nav=710" title="GM uses all caps, so be it">Saturn SKY</a>. Should show up at dealerships <a href="http://autos.yahoo.com/consumerreports/article/new_for_2005_2006.html">next (2006) Spring</a> as a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/entry/1234000217026221/">2007 model year offering</a> with a price tag around $25,000. One question, at least for now, is: How come none of the pictures feature the convertible top closed? All the websites have the same half dozen photos. Not claiming this sporty coupe will compete on performance or overall with 'low end' Mercedes, BMW or Toyota models (does the Solara convertible fit here?) but if General Motors can produce a decent quality car this should sell.</p>
