<p>My first round of auctions finished up yesterday and I have to say that I'm satisfied with the results. 12 out of 18 items sold for a total of $222 less fees but plus shipping; hopefully I pegged the shipping charges at the right level to include the fees, whch I'm told is extremely standard. Of the six items that didn't sell, I got email about one from someone who said she was concerned about my zero rating but that if I relisted (after exchanging emails) she would bid--I did and she already has.</p>
<p>Dealing with all the end of auction/payment-related emails and prepping the items for shipment has been a tizzy. Yes, tizzy is the proper word. Already, most of the people who won have paid me through PayPal though one winner is from Canada and will mail me an International Money Order, so I've got everything paid for packed and ready for the Post Office.</p>
<p>I had second copies of three of the DVDs that sold, so I posted those as new auctions last night and while I was at Wal*Mart this morning I picked up some new cheap ones plus some colorful sleeveless basketball tops that were on clearance for $3 each and those will go up later today. As will some very cool dolls that Vivian has donated to the cause. Cher, Britney, Elvis, two of the three 2nd gen Charlie's Angels and more.</p>
<p>Buy! Buy! Buy!</p>
