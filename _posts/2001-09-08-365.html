<p><b>Green tea: not just for Chinese restaurants</b></p>
<p>Ivanhoe's Medical Breakthroughs reports on the <a href="http://www.ivanhoe.com/stream/benefitsofgreentea.shtml">Benefits of Green Tea</a> as reported by two UCLA medical researchers. Regular drinking of green tea has been shown to lower the risk of breast cancer, gastritis, and stomach cancer but Drs. Zuo-Feng Zhang and Mai Nguyen believe further studies will show similar benefits for several other types of cancers. A key differentiation between green and other teas is that green tea is not fermented, a process that destroys the anti-oxidents that are naturally part of all teas.</p>
