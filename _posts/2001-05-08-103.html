<p><b>Science Fiction and transcendence</b>
<p>Norman Spinrad, a great writer of science fiction, uses the June edition of his <a href="http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0106/stories/asimovs.onbooks.shtml">Asimov's On Books column</a> to discuss transcendence; that is, "literatures [science fiction and fantasy] whose very existence depends upon literary elements that transcend the consensus reality of their readerships." Excellent writing and, not coincidentally, reviews of <a href="http://www.levity.com/corduroy/leguin.htm">Le Guin's</a> The Telling, Soulsaver by James Stevens-Arce, <a href="http://www.ian-andrew.co.uk/ArthurCClarke1.html" title="a fan site">The Collected Stories of Arthur C. Clark</a>, and The Spike by Damien Broderick. The last is one I'd seen in a store and thought to read but after this review I'll probably skip it; the review is more worthy of the reading time while the book attempts to speculate on what the <a href="http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~nv91-asa/Trans/vinge" title="SF author Vernor Vinge popularized this concept in the novel Marooned in Realtime">Singularity</a> is going to be like.</p>
