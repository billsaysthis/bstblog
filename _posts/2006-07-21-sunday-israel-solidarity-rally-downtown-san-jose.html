<p>Federation is sponsoring a major rally this Sunday, July 23, at 5:00 at the Circle of Palms, the Plaza on Market St. between the Fairmont Hotel and the San Jose Museum of Art.</p>
<p>If you live further north, <a href="http://www.jcrc.org/israel/solidarity_rally_7_23-06.htm">a similar rally</a> will be held that day in San Francisco at noon at the Justin Herman Plaza at the foot of Embarcadero and Market St.</p>
<p>Show the world that we Stand With Israel during these terrible days! Please remember to wear blue and white. Feel free to make your own signs but please no signs or graphics offensive to any racial, ethnic or religious group including but not limited to Arabs, Islam, or Palestinians.</p>
<p>If you can't attend or want to take care of this ahead of time, you can <a href="https://ssl9.pair.com/jfed/israelcrisisfund.html">donate to the Israel Crisis Fund online</a>. Only $350 can take an Israeli child out of bomb shelter and bring him or her to a summer camp in a safer place (<a href="http://www.jewishagency.org/NR/exeres/99EF1C01-CC37-4159-9CF9-9C83BF2D9AF6">photos</a>).</p>
