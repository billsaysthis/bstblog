<p>Gary Suson posted an <a href="http://www.septembereleven.net/">amazing photo essay</a> on 9/11 starting with the events of the <a href="http://www.septembereleven.net/page2.html">first few minutes</a> and continuing through the <a href="http://www.septembereleven.net/page210.htm">clean up</a>. I got to this <a href="http://www.septembereleven.net/page104.htm">11 year old's handwritten note</a> and just broke down again. I can't even look at all the pictures, the emotion is so overwhelming. I couldn't watch the HBO documentary Sunday night either. <em>[via <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com">garret</a> and the NY Times]</em></p>
