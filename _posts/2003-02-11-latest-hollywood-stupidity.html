<p>No, I'm not gonna get cranky just because the Sweet One made me watch the craptastic <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/vivroar/archives/2003_02_09_archive.html#90307727">Joe Millionaire</a> last night (we're down to one TV while the bathroom remodeling is done). Though that was painful.</p>
<p>This crank is inspired by the geniuses at Paramount. They apparently are just <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hollywoodreporter/film/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1814087">about to sign</a> Tim Allen to star in a big screen take on '50s TV sitcom <a href="http://www.timvp.com/father.html">Father Knows Best</a>. You remember, the one that starred Robert Young as the dad and Jane Wyatt as the <em>MOM</em>, who have three kids already (Betty, Bud, and Kathy). But the studio jizzbots are apparently working on a script in which Dad is single and has a son who enters him in a Father of the Year contest under false pretenses. The essay, of course, wins and Dad is going to spill the beans as a lesson to Junior. Until he meets the judge, who just happens to be his perfect potential wife. Hijinks ensue. Hilarity, well that's another thing entirely.</p>
<p>Ben Stiller as Starsky or Lucy Liu as an Angel is one thing, but please, let's at least find a story/structure that comes within the same lightyear as the original if you need to use an existing name as a cheap way to sell your movie. Pretty please.</p>
