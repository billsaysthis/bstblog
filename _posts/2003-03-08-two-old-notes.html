<p>A 5000 Lire note, cinquemila, sits on my desk<br />
<br />A 1000 Lire note, mille, rests atop it<br />
<br />Reminding me of the trip to Sicily and Sorrento<br />
<br />I took not too long ago.</p>
<p>But these notes are no longer legal tender,<br />
<br />No longer worth the few American pennies I<br />
<br />Exchanged for them at the hotel desk,<br />
<br />Replaced by the latest Euro fashion.</p>
<p>Consider that I could easily have bought an<br />
<br />Espresso and canoli with them instead of bringing<br />
<br />Them home, was that the right choice?<br />
<br />The past is gone and cannot be changed.</p>
<p>But then what is the worth of them as a reminder to me<br />
<br />Of the wonderful time I spent with my father<br />
<br />Of the two weeks in a new place and a different culture<br />
<br />Of the ways in which my eyes were opened?</p>
<p>I know I would not trade them for a couple of shiny Euros<br />
<br />I would rather have them right here to see, to touch<br />
<br />The portraits of Montessori and Bellini looking to the distance<br />
<br />The green and tan and blue, the blue and magenta of two old notes.</p>
