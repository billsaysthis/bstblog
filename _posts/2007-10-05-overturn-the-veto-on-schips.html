<p>Please join me and nearly 200,000 patriotic Americans in <a href="http://www.democrats.org/FightForKids">telling your Senators and Representative</a> that you want them to vote to overturn the veto on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Children%27s_Health_Insurance_Program">State Children's Health Insurance Program</a>. Your voice is especially important if any of your three elected representatives are Republicans since winning this battle requires quite a few GOP members to go against their President. If you prefer not to use the Democratic Party's service which I linked, just go to their official pages and email or fax them directly--just be sure you do it!</p>
<p>Here's what I wrote to Anna Eshoo, Barbara Boxer and Diane Feinstein (in this matter, shorter is very much better):</p>
<p>When this legislation is taken up I urge you to vote to overturn President Bush's ill-considered, thoughtless veto of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program and stand up for children who otherwise won’t have health care.</p>
<p>If we can spend hundreds of billions on military actions in the Mideast that have little hope of providing longterm security, surely we can ensure the welfare of our most precious resource, the children.</p>
