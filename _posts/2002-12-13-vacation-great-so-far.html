<p>Just a quick trip report, details to follow.</p>
<p>The flight was okay, no problems with security or checking in, and the plane pulled away from the gate a couple of minutes early. Lilo and Stich was the movie, which I would have watched except for the nasty whine over the headphones. Dad was at EWR smiling!</p>
<p>Wednesday was a slow day, the only significant event was a trip to Costco to buy a new eMachines PC to replace Dad's aged, no longer really functioning CompUSA special. Mom made a yummy lamb chops and steak dinner, with sauteed onions and mushrooms plus string beans. She also made a batch of Atkins blueberry muffins so we wouldn't have to schlep from CA--thanks Mom!</p>
<p>Thursday was a NJ Transit train ride into Manhattan. Started out with a mixup on Amtrack ($38/person) versus NJ Transit ($9.80/person) but only cost us about 25 minutes. I hate train and bus rides! We made our way to my sister Joanne's apartment on the Upper East Side, went for a little stroll around the neighborhood waiting for her to get home from work, and then we broke our adherence to Atkins for the evening and treated The Sweet One to her first real New York pizza (plus some yummy fried calamari).</p>
<p>Earlier today we took the bus down to Rockefeller Center to see the tree and ice rink (TSO's big request) and then a looooon walk back to 1st Ave. to get the bus back up here. After I finish this we are off to the <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> (my big request) and then dinner and Nemesis with TSO's best friend and her husband, who're driving down from western Massachusetts. Tomorrow back to NJ for a big finale dinner with the whole family and then, sadly, vacation is over.</p>
<p>Pictures are being taken, will be posted soon as well.</p>
