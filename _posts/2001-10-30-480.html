<p><b>Teaching intolerance</b></p>
<p>Thomas Friedman, writing in the NY Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/30/opinion/30FRIE.html">continues the lesson on the Saudi royal family</a>. The short and sweet:</p>
<p>- their textbooks do not teach tolerance for non-Muslims: Muslims must "consider the infidels their enemy."</p>
<p>- they don't want America to know the truth about their country. The one time we sent a Arab-speaking ambassador, he was forced out after six months.</p>
<p>Friedman, as always, is an important read. What I'd like to know is when will a reporter get someone from the Bush administration on the record on this topic.</p>
