<p>There, through the hazy desert glare, I see<br />
<br />Luis walking over sand with a torn up t-shirt<br />
<br />Covering his head and cracked cheap sunlasses<br />
<br />Over his eyes. Ojos.</p>
<p>Luis is part of a line of 14 people wandering<br />
<br />Through the southwest sands, aiming at the<br />
<br />Heart of America. All of them wear dirty clothes<br />
<br />With Spanish words. Palabras.</p>
<p>The group has been walking in the sand<br />
<br />For four days now and they have little food<br />
<br />Left, though there are many days yet to<br />
<br />Travel with hunger. Hambre.</p>
<p>Luis walks next to his nephew, who grew up in the<br />
<br />Same little city where all his people lived.<br />
<br />Men from the Parti came through and when they<br />
<br />Left it was time. Tiempo.</p>
<p>Yes, time, because the nephew came to Luis,<br />
<br />Stood up with all his 16 years and said what<br />
<br />neither Luis nor his father would say, that<br />
<br />Time was gone. Ido.</p>
<p>"Walk away, walk away, walk away. We must<br />
<br />Walk away from our home," the nephew chanted.<br />
<br />"Walk away, walk away, to the north we must go.<br />
<br />Leave this life behind. En el pasado."</p>
<p>Over a dozen others joined the nephew and Luis,<br />
<br />Gathering together what they could not leave,<br />
<br />Cramming in food, water, a few towels, but<br />
<br />No one had a hat. Sombrero.</p>
<p>The sand is all that any of them can think of now<br />
<br />No one thinks about America or the bright<br />
<br />Picture on the tv that drew them into this trip<br />
<br />Across the desert. Desierto.</p>
<p>Luis played games with his nephew at first<br />
<br />Taking their minds off the drudgery and sore feet.<br />
<br />And each day he grew more quiet, less able or<br />
<br />Willing to smile. Sonrisa.</p>
<p>After a week, three of their fellows sat down.<br />
<br />They were at the side of a road some miles<br />
<br />From any town. One, tow, three, they<br />
<br />Simply sat down. Abajo.</p>
<p>The nephew stopped walking himself, to see<br />
<br />If they were all taking a rest but no others<br />
<br />Did and soon those three were lost behind a<br />
<br />Curve in the road. Camino.</p>
<p>"Walk away, walk away, walk away. We must<br />
<br />Walk away from our home," the nephew chanted.<br />
<br />"Walk away, walk away, to the north we must go.<br />
<br />Leave this life behind. En el pasado."</p>
<p>One day, with the sun high above them the troop<br />
<br />Came to a small lake. There were no other people<br />
<br />There and when a small woman ran in she<br />
<br />Never came out. Nunca reaparecido.</p>
<p>Weeks passed, days where not one word was said,<br />
<br />Though all of them just knew when it was time to<br />
<br />Rest or eat or sleep, and each night they slept<br />
<br />Knowing they were closer. M&#225;s cerca.</p>
<p>Luis ate all the food he had packed on a Tuesday;<br />
<br />Nephew finished his that Thursday. Friday, a<br />
<br />Package with more supplies was at their feet<br />
<br />In the morning. Manana.</p>
<p>Thought came slowly to him, his mind occupied<br />
<br />Watching a bird circle over a hill or a breeze<br />
<br />Pass through the wild grass off the road.<br />
<br />It was enough. Bastantes.</p>
<p>Finally they came to a patch of strange sand<br />
<br />Whiter than any sand in Mexico, softer and hotter,<br />
<br />But in this place the walkers lost all connection<br />
<br />To their homes. Hogares.</p>
<p>"Walk away, walk away, walk away. We must<br />
<br />Walk away from our home," the nephew chanted.<br />
<br />"Walk away, walk away, to the north we must go.<br />
<br />Leave this life behind. En el pasado."</p>
<p>There was no more food, no more water<br />
<br />No more mysterious food parcels and they could<br />
<br />Not find the way out from this white sand.<br />
<br />Where I watched. Mir&#233;.</p>
<p>Only four days passed from when they entered<br />
<br />Four days that stretched out from morning to night<br />
<br />When the Sun simply vanished from above, the<br />
<br />Stars came late. Tarde.</p>
<p>None of them was hungry, none of them was<br />
<br />Tired, none of them asked where they were<br />
<br />None of them laughed, none of them cried<br />
<br />None of them smiled. Sonrieron.</p>
<p>I was laying on a ridge not far above the sands<br />
<br />Watching but not being seen, listening<br />
<br />Though there was nothing to hear, waiting<br />
<br />But for what? &#191;Qu&#233;?</p>
<p>In time I expect that something will happen<br />
<br />Someone, perhaps, will drive in to their<br />
<br />Circle with a truck, a laugh, and tell<br />
<br />Them to climb aboard. Subida encendido.</p>
<p>"Walk away, walk away, walk away. We must<br />
<br />Walk away from our home," the nephew chanted.<br />
<br />"Walk away, walk away, to the north we must go.<br />
<br />Leave this life behind. En el pasado."</p>
