<p>The start of a new <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?pg=gall&amp;gall=family2">gallery of family photos</a>, these are older shots taken on film--some going back to the 1920s--and scanned in by the Big Guy (thanks!). The existing family gallery has more than enough in it already.<br /></p>
