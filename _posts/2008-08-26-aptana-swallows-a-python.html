<p>Work is going really well here, we are making big strides towards our goal of getting production releases across much of our product line during the second half of September (Studio 1.2, PHP plugin 1.0, Jaxer 1.0 and Clouds 1.0). Keeping us busy but we've had help in the form of some very strong new hires too.</p>
<p>This morning we also <a href="http://www.aptana.com/blog/pcolton/pydev_news">announced the acquisition of Pydev</a>, the premier Eclipse plugin for Python. Fabio Zadronzy has developed a strong functionality base and a large enthusiastic set of users--the Big G themselves are global licensees of the product--and he'll continue to drive the product forward as well as help us adapt features across our family of supported languages.</p>
<p>As part of the push to release several of our remote staff have flown in for a week or two, or in one case, permanently, giving me a chance to put a face to their voices.</p>
<p>Keep your eyes peeled, there is much more good stuff coming from Aptana soon!</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Update:</span> Don't just take my word for it, check out the <a href="http://britg.com/2008/08/26/why-aptana-is-quickly-becoming-the-killer-stack/">effusive blog post</a> from Brit Gardner.</p>
