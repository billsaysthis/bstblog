<p>According to <a href="http://www.myvirtualmodel.com/">My Virtual Model</a>, below left is an approximation of my current size and to the right what I'll look like at target weight. Doesn't seem heavy enough for now or slender enough for later. Or take age into account. I am, of course, much more handsome.</p>
