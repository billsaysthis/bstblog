<p>Yesterday was a great day. When Clint Dempsey put in the first goal I was jumping and screaming, though I had to see the replay to believe it. When Landon drove home the second just past Julio Cesar's leaping form I was laughing with joy and pounding the countertop.
<div></div>
<div>And then reality set in. Or at least Bob Bradley's reality. 40 seconds after the restart Luis Fabiano secured the Golden Boot by nutmegging Jonathon Spector and Brazil had their stride back.</div>
<div></div>
<div>When Sasha Kleschjen was subbed in I knew in the back of my mind we were done. This is how we really missed Michael Bradley: Bennie Feilhaber did a decent job in his place but we were left without a quality sub. Bradley the Gaffer could have done a better job in the locker room at the half because letting in three second half goals after pitching first half shutouts once is on the players but twice is on the boss.</div>
<div></div>
<div>My big hope is that with this tournament and a good showing next Summer, at least last eight and preferably last four, will change the minds of the next Rossi or Subotic. Think where the US would be with those two youngsters in the squad!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Now I know we have players born in other countries playing for us, and may soon have another in Jermaine Jones, but the difference is that, for example, Freddie Adu came to the US with his parents as a small child while Rossi was not only born here but lived in the US through high school (give or take). He plays for Italy based on his father's birth certificate.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In any case I'm not saying players should be prevented from choosing to play elsewhere, rather that US Soccer should be their choice. </div>
<div></div>
<div>I also think the attitude question is subject to generational change. A generation ago we didn't even think to qualify for the World Cup, nor did we have a serious professional league. This generation expects to qualify, and regularly win our regional tournaments, and MLS is seen as a place to start before hopping to a European club. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Next generation, the kids who are 8-12 now, will expect to win. Against anyone.</div>
