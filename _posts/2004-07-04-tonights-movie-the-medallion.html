<p>Why Jackie Chan agreed to make <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/themedallion/index.html">this movie</a> is confusing. I know that deals often take a long time to come together but he must have been aware of Chow Yun Fat's <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_04_20_blog_archive.phtml#200173732">Bulletproof Monk</a>. Both films are so much the same that it's not funny, except that Chan tries to put a humorous spin with the use of Brit comic Lee Evans as his partner/foil.</p>
<p>Plenty of eye candy: Claire Forlani is properly luscious as the third member of their Interpol team, Christy Chung has a short bit as Evans' lethal wife and Nicola Berwick is the bad bitch. Julian Sands doesn't go far enough over the top playing the bad guy. Alex Bao is nearly not there as the child monk who brings forth the power of the medallion.</p>
<p>Somehow this took <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0288045/fullcredits">five writers</a> to put together! And the direction seemed to be on the order of: Put the camera here, step to your marks here, come on Jackie, enunciate!</p>
<p><em>not recommended</em></p>
