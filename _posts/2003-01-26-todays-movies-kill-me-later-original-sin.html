<p>From 2001, <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0243595">Kill Me Later</a> stars Selma Blair as a morose, suicidal banker. Finally fed up with the total absence of love or pleasure, she heads to the roof of her office building to jump off. Instead, Max Beesley races up to the roof ahead of the cop whose chasing him after he and a couple of pals robbed Blair's bank. She still wants to jump but he holds her hostage to fend off the cop; he promises to kill her later. They escape (where would the movie be otherwise?), keep running from the cops, but never really find a way to get clear. Amazing, again, but the two fall in love.</p>

<p>Same year: <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0218922">Original Sin</a> is Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas in 19th century Cuba, a triffling film about passion and, I suppose, truth. The biggest surprise to me was that Jolie did her own nude and topless scenes. There should be more surprises but writer/director Michael Cristofer seems incapable of keeping his powder in his pants. Not even much of the beautiful 'Cuban' countryside.</p>
