<p>[<a href="http://www.blogactionday.com">Blog Action Day</a>]</p>
<p>I am only a good, not a great, thinker so you'll not be getting any massive new insights into bettering our world in this post. Still, your indulgence is begged for the time to read on.</p>
<p>Everything is connected, right? Not just the hypothetical butterfly flapping its wings somewhere over Asia eventually blowing up into a tornado over Kansas nor the small world theory, better known as the Kevin Bacon Game, which says that anyone--even you!--can reach anyone else in the country in no more than six social steps. For instance, Robert Scoble will take my phone call, Steve Ballmer (or another top level MSFT exec) will take Robert's call, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D, Washington, and a former exec at Microsoft) will take Ballmer's call and Al Gore will take Cantwell's call; that's only four degrees from me to Gore.</p>
<p>More to the point, all the choices we make have consequences and what connects them is that they are our choices and we are all in this together. Every gallon of gas I burn is one less gallon available somewhere down the line. Every consumer electronics device I buy and use up is a collection of paper, metals and plastics that is gone. Every cup of coffee I drink... well, my body returns almost all of the coffee to the system where it eventually becomes available for use again, eh?</p>
<p>What I want to leave you thinking about is that consumption consumes. Over the last 50 years our society has transformed its values about material things, from prioritizing quality, craftsmanship and durability to looking for the lowest prices and commodity, disposable products. Everything we think of as antiques, after all, were built at least 50 years ago but how many items made in 2007 will be of other than museum interest in 2057?</p>
<p>To some extent this post covers much of the thesis of my Aug. 7 post, <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/2007_08_01_blog_archive.phtml#5535328168790954867">Graham's Stuff</a>, in which I focused on one quote from Paul Graham's essay <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/stuff.html">Stuff</a>: "I have too much stuff." As you begin buying presents for the upcoming holiday season, consider the gifts you select and how they correspond to your values on the environment, not just in themselves but the follow on effects as well.</p>
<p>Will the gift last more than one season? Will it consume much electricity or gas? Will the recipient need or want to buy other things to use with it (e.g., a Wii or XBox needs games)? What will happen when the recipient disposes of it--can and will it be recycled? Is the gift really the best choice for your loved one or friend or just something that brings short term happiness?</p>
<p>Does your thinking, your gift selection, reflect simplistic membership in the American Consumer Society or can you stretch beyond that mentality and find presents that offer quality and lasting value? Remember that your choices are also teaching the people receiving your gifts, the influence is one more way in which everything is connected.</p>
