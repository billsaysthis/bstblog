<p>Well yes, of course, as anyone reading this is surely already aware. But the question is also the title of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/business/yourmoney/10starts.html">an article in today's New York Times</a> for which I was interviewed and in which I'm briefly quoted. Amusingly my 40+ minute conversation with the writer was condensed down to:<br />
<blockquote>The person they ultimately found was Bill Lazar, a blogger and former programmer. “This would be my first full-time job focusing on supporting the content of another blogger,” said Mr. Lazar, noting that the job was still in negotiations. “To get paid to work on blogs and the related technology would be great.” He declined to discuss what the job would pay.</p></blockquote>
<p>I declined not out of modesty or even discretion but because there was not then, nor sadly is there now, a specific money offer on the table and hence no accurate answer to provide. And is there linkage in the article, no, because <span style="font-style:italic;">the Times just doesn't do that</span>, and not even a mention of my site's name (which others mentioned do get). Hey, she did get my name spelled right.</p>
<p>Though Ms. Whittaker doesn't mention it, I'm pretty sure she contact Scoble because I mentioned him as a high profile example and there's an easy zag from him to Steve Rubel. So <a href="http://www.micropersuasion.com/">Steve</a>, if you see this, we should talk—I'm sure Edelman can use my skill set advantageously!</p>
