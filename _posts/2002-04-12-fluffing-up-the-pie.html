<p>Spent a chunk of time last night and this morning <em>enhancing</em>  the <a href="http://www.metapie.blogspot.com/">metapie weblog</a>. Main changes were to make the post author more clear by having it shown ahead of the post, making the site more readable by increasing the font size (-1 is not legible to these old eyes any more!), and adding links for the team members to their home sites. I also added in a connection to a new tool called <a href="http://brentashley.blogchat.com/">BlogChat</a>, which is in beta but appears to have the basic functionality working, on the page. No idea what plans <a href="http://www.limitedpie.com">M. Pie</a>, the mysterious and anonymous trader who hosts metapie, has in mind for it but it works. To test BlogChat I had a long, pleasant conversation with another one of the beta testers, a self-proclaimed web weenie named <a href="http://www.jessycawallace.com/tmp/index.php">Jessyca Wallace</a>, and the results were as expected. Go read metapie and if you have something to say about investing think about joining!</p>
