<p>A friend of mine is now at an Israeli startup called <a href="http://www.toluna.com/">Toluna</a>, a web service where anyone can create polls and opinion topics at no cost. What you create can be embedded in a blog, as I've done in this post, or hosted on Toluna.com. Either way the results are <a href="http://www.toluna.com/polls/65838/Who_makes_better_music?" title="My poll's page">tracked for you</a>.</p>
<p>Members can earn redeemable rewards points from a list of well-known partners and participate in prize drawings. So far the members and partners are mainly in the UK but I'm told expansion to the US is imminent.</p>
<p>Here's my first Toluna poll:</p>
<p>
<div style="text-align:center;width:250px;"><a href="http://www.toluna.com/" target="_blank" title="Create polls and vote for free. dPolls.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dPollsLink.aspx" alt="Create polls and vote for free. dPolls.com" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>Anyone who knows me knows how I'm voting.</p>
