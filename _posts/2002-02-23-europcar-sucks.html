<p>Apparently I am far from alone in <a href="http://www.europcarsucks.com/complaints.asp">not having a good experience with Europcar</a> since Joe Santilli has gone to the trouble and expense of putting up a website on the topic. His story is unpleasant and he's clearly Googled the subject to come up with a list of other people who've complained. That's how he found <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/italy/italy_tripover.phtml">my little story</a>, which was included on his list. On the other hand, as a reasonably large <a href="http://www.europcar.com/english/corporate.htm">firm</a>, one has to wonder if less than 20 complaints are all that significant and mine wasn't all that much of a horror story (at least the inconveniences from Europcar weren't).</p>
