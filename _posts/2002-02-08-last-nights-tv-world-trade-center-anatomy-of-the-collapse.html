<p>The Learning Channel had an interesting show last night, <a href="http://tlc.discovery.com/schedule/episode.jsp?episode=553937000">World Trade Center: Anatomy of the Collapse</a>. The producers interviewed a number of individuals, some of whom were involved with building the WTC 30 years ago, structual engineers who analyzed the collaps, and Paul Johnson, architectural critic for the NY Times. The show was generally very well done and brought out a lot of important information. Sadly the structural engineer who was responsible for the WTC towers' innovative design feels guilty over his choice but I don't think he can be blamed. Did you know these two buildings had more office space than Cincinatti?</p>
