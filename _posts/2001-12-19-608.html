<p><strong>LotR: Building the One Ring</strong></p>
<p>One more day. Or actually, about 7 1/2 hours since many theaters are having 12:01 showings. Will McCarthy, columnist for SciFi Weekly, looks at the feasibility of <a href="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/current/labnotes.html">building the One Ring</a> with technology available today. Let's just say quantum dots will be very big in our lives before much longer. Can we do it? Almost, he almost makes it but not quite. Still, could be very cool. I like the immortality bit myself.</p>
<p><em>One Ring to rule them all, one Ring to find them,<br />
<br />One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them</em></p>
<p>That would be a cool to have, who will front me the big cash?</p>
