<p>Ed Yourdan is a respected thinker on the process of software development and has been for several decades. His company Yourdan, Inc. practically launched the software methodology business and most of the bright shining stars back in the '70s. However there are some people who wouldn't mind seeing him shut up, I guess, and those folks will find amusement by looking at his weblog in this way (<a href="http://yourdon.com/Blog/2002_01_13_archive.html#8651850">click here</a> and after the page loads hit your home key). Note that this may only work in Internet Explorer. By the way, I like Ed, always have.</p>
