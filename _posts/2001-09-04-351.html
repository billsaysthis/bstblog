<p><b>HP-CPQ: More people think its a stupid deal</b></p>
<p>Forbes.com weighs in to call it the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2001/09/04/0904topnews.html">Deal Of The Year--In 1998</a>. Mike Langberg, writing in the SJ Mercury News (a site to which I prefer not to link since they charge for access after seven days), calls for government regulators to reject the deal on antitrust grounds; a combined company, assuming today's market shares stand up (not likely in myopinion), would have a 67% share of the retail PC market.</p>
<p>Carly Fiorina, chairperson of HP and of the combined company, told reporters, "Hang with us, it's going to be a great party." Not if you're one of the thousands of workers who'll be losing a job as a result of this deal. The two have already announced over 17,000 layoffs this year but execs are projecting another $2.5 billion in savings from the deal, which means several thousand more employees will get the big L. C|Net News.com <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-7047156.html?tag=tp_pr">analyzes the challenges</a> and sees a hard road ahead.</p>
<p>If this deal does not go through, I have to wonder if Fiorina and Compaq chair Michael Capellas will keep their jobs. Fiorina, especially, is under pressure to deliver after a previous acquisition of PricewaterhouseCoopers fell through last fall and she completely mishandled Wall Street over the first half of this year as HP forecasts fell and fell and fell.</p>
<p>I have to fess up to a small error in my previous entry where I said that Compaq had thrown away their entire investment in Digital. That isn't completely true as they retain a very large and profitable services group; what they did throw away was Digital's hardware business, which once was number two only to IBM. Of course, when they were number two, founder and then-chairman Ken Olsen famously said something to the effect of "Who needs a PC on their desk or in their home?"</p>
<p>I stand with my earlier sentiment: these are two drowning rats trying to use each other as life preservers. A Giga Research analyst had positive comments but that isn't surprising given the amount of money the two companies pay Giga and the other maket research firms. More importantly, <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-7050803.html?tag=tp_pr">Wall Street is not reacting well</a>, and both stocks are down in the initial trading with HP off 15%!</p>
