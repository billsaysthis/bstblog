<p>I have a Google Alert set up for NetDynamics, which most frequently shows me articles where former colleagues are mentioned. This morning, though, I got one for this FastCompany <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/nc02/026.html?partner=rss">interview with Craig Newmark</a>. I scanned the article trying to see where a company that died over six years ago would be relevant and at the very end he mentions my old peer-to-peer support forum as a sample of a commercial site with real community. Cool, but that forum closed years ago. Then I looked at the top of the page and noticed the article is from the <span style="font-weight:bold;">November 2000 issue</span>! How funny, what a timely alert Mr. Google.</p>
