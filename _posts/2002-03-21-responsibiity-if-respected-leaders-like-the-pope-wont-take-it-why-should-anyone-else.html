<p>Others have raged on about the pedophile priests, but to me these guys are much like any other group of people, weak and sometimes willing to act on temptations they see. Not that I think the priests should avoid punishment for their crimes, far from it, but what I find far more disturbing is the behavior of the so-called princes of the Church, Cardinals like Egan and Law, who directly covered up the disgusting actions of some priests in their dioces, and even more the Pope.</p>
<p>John Paul II issued a 22 page statement today, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/international/international-pope-pedophilia.html">one whole paragraph of which comments on the Pedophilia Scandals</a>. Cardinal Dario Castrillon Hoyos, head of the Vatican Congregation for the Clergy, who presented the report and held a press conference said that "the church had not neglected priestly pedophilia." Hoyos said sexual abuse was the product of modern culture, where sexual liberties had influenced priests too. Um, yeah, sure. Which covers the actions of the priests who committed these nasty, terrible acts. Notice, though, the report makes no mention of any wrongdoing by higherups in the Church. That's why after decades of covering scandals by shuffling priests from parish to parish so they can molest more children, when there is no more chance of covering up the truth, throws a few bones to the public, a few dollars, and then no one else need answer for the scandal. Of course, I'm of Jewish heritage, what do I know, but I thought the Pope in this modern age would look to heal rather than throw dirt over such an issue.</p>
