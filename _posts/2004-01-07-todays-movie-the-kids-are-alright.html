<p>With the film successes of <em>Tommy</em> and <em>Quadrophenia</em> in the bank, Pete Townsend and Company capitalized with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079400/">The Kids Are Alright</a>. While the first two were 'real' films, with plots and everything, this one is more a collection of film clips and interview bits massaged together--if <em>Kids</em> came out 15 years later it would have been an MTV special or DVD release. But if you're a <a href="http://www.thewho.net/">Who fan</a>, this is well worth the time to see and enjoy. Lots of classic tunage, including a great and revealing live version of <a href="http://www.thewho.net/discography/songs/ShoutandShimmy.html">Shout and shimmy</a> and nicely done recording studio footage of then-new <em>Who Are You</em>, and some primo Moon looniness topping.</p>
<p><em>Recommended</em></p>
