<p>There's a bus parked outside my house. A normal-sized, regular <a href="http://www.vta.org/">VTA</a> bus. There are no buses with routes that pass my house yet this is not the first time I've seen one parked out here. It says "Not In Service" across the top (and as I write these words pulled away) but still, it's weird. I live on a dinky little side street.</p>
