<p>Well, when all the work is done, and the finish line seems fairly close as we're mainly into closing up walls and ceilings, the new homestead will be really nice. The new flooring is complete, the roofer did his work days ago, the plumbing and electrical is nearly finished and the handy man is moving at good pace.</p>
<p>The movers did their work today and I can comfortably recommend <a href="http://www.partnervanlines.com/?source=redirect">Partner Moving</a> as this is the second time we've used them. Less than $600, including everything except tip, to move a two bedroom apartment and they were done in five hours.</p>
<p>New appliances arrive tomorrow and I believe we'll be able to have the building inspector Monday, meaning when he signs off we can close up everything else and put a fresh coat of paint all around. After the inspection we can really unpack and settle in, though we should be sleeping here from tonight.</p>
<p>For the weekend we snagged two tickets to the Earthquakes v. Galaxy match courtesy of <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2008/06/02/microsoftventurebeat-reader-soccer-ticket-giveaway/">VentureBeat and Microsoft</a>. Quakes are playing well lately and I'm not sure that LA will have my former favorite American player Landon Donovan available, so this could be a stronger game than expected for a first v. last confrontation.</p>
<p>Anyway, all this was way more expensive than expected but I'm getting happier about it by the day.</p>
