<p>Wesley's back and bad as ever in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0187738">Blade II (2002)</a>. Kristofferson's back too as sidekick/mentor Whistler. This <a href="http://www.blade2.com">sequel</a> is nastier, bloodier, and more violent than the original. Some of the imagery is so disturbing that I wouldn't go to see this if you're easily upset. On the other hand, the special effects folks have come up with some cool visuals for when the vampires die, burning them to cinders. The fight scenes are somewhat repetitive and heavily influenced by The Matrix. Luke Goss is nicely nasty as the head Reaper, Leonor Varela looks good in leather and Ron Perlman, who also played a beast in TV's Beauty and the Beast, makes a surprising but good appearance as one of the vampires (he'll also show up at the end of the year in Star Trek: Nemesis). Not recommended unless you're a big Snipes fan or totally into these gorefests.</p>
