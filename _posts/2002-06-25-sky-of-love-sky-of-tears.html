<p>Come on up for the rising! The title track for Bruce Springsteen <a href="http://demand1.stream.aol.com/ramgen/aol/us/aolmusic/artists/sony/brucespringstein/brucespringstein_therising_web.rm">can now be heard</a> on his website--the whole thing, not just a 30 second sample! Latest news on the release:
<ul>
<li>Springsteen and the E Street Band will play four songs from The Rising on the Today Show on July 30</li>
<li>In addition to the standard CD, there will be a <a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/specialpackage.html">special limited edition deluxe package</a> including the CD in a hardcover book with a 40 page, full color booklet filled with extra photos and handwritten lyrics.</li>
<li>Three more songs from the album--"Lonesome Day," "Into the Fire" and "Mary's Place"--will premiere on July 8, 15 and 22, respectively, on AOL Music (<a href="http://music.netscape.com/">music.netscape.com</a> or AOL Keyword: First Listen)</li>
<li>You can <a href="http://www.columbiarecords.com/contest/springsteen/">enter to win</a> a ticket to a pre-release listening party in 19 cities--San Francisco's is on July 11 (would it be too much to ask to win one?)</li>
</ul>
<p>What did I think of the song, you ask? It rocks, hard, with <a href="http://www.nj.com/printer/printer.ssf?/base/entertainment-0/1024737007225722.xml">terrific lyrics</a> and I love the swirling mist of Frederici's organ and the crisp drive of Max's drums. Bruce may be coming up on his 53rd birthday in September, The Rising may be coming 30 years after Greetings from Asbury Park, but he still makes the music that reaches right inside of  me better than anyone else.</p>
