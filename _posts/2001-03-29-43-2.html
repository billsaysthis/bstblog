<p><b>Going Offline?</b>
<p>Well, my DSL is provided by  <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/010328/hsw029.html">NorthPoint Communications</a>, which is going out of business and will be shutting down it's network. The article says the network was being shutdown today, so I'm not clear why I still have a connection; my ISP is working feverishly to switch us customers over to Rhythm or Covad, but I may be without DSL for two to six weeks. Well, this sure sucks.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> Well, it happened yesterday, the DSL went down and I on dial-up for the time being. And I'm supposed to get a call today with details but it has come yet.</p>
