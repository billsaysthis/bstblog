<p><b>Lord of the Rings: excellent new trailer</b></p>
<p>Apple has posted a QuickTime version of the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/newline/fellowship_of_the_ring/">Fellowship of The Ring</a> trailer and if you have a highspeed web connection (or are willing to let your dial-up connection run all night), you must see it. This trailer has the clearest visuals yet of what director Peter Jackson's Middle Earth looks like and the results are stunning down to very small details like flames running around the inside of The Ring.</p>
