<p><b>This is why programming is cool!</b><br />

<p>Thanks and a big shout out to Hannes Dorn for his <a href="http://phpclasses.upperdesign.com/browse.html/package/122">CDir class</a> that gives me a real smooth way to grab a list of the weblog archive files and then I wrote the code to display them in the dropdown list at the top of <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_07_29_blog_archive.phtml">webLog archive pages</a>.</p>
<p>Another TaaBSO to Phil Ringnalda for his <a href="http://philor.tripod.com/archivescripts/included/">Blogger archive listing scripts</a> that show how to convert the date-based archive filenames to something useful. I'd tell him but there's no email address across all his great pages!</p>
<p>All in all, I spent about five hours tonight reprogramming the home page and weblog archive pages plus the Blogger templates and I barely noticed the time passing. This was fun. And I'm really looking forward to the new visuals for the site.</p>
