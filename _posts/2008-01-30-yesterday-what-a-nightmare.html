<p>You probably saw that Highway 101 was closed from 2 p.m. on between Highway 92 and Palo Alto. The Marketo office is in San Mateo, a few blocks north of 92, while the BillSaysThis HQ has been in Mountain View for 11 years now. These two facts resulted in three (3!) hour elapsing between leaving the office and arriving at the HQ. BST executives were unwilling to provide a quote suitable for our family-friendly publication.</p>
<p>The tanker truck vs. minivan action behind the 101 closure caused a 2,000 gallon gasoline spill. The gas deteriorated the highway asphalt so badly an emergency repavement was needed; two lanes are still closed 24 hours later and all northbound lanes will be closed again after tonight's commute hours to work on the rest. Fortunately my evening commute is southbound so I hope it will be okay, a repeat of yesterday's would cause severe mental issues.</p>
<p>(One wonders, of course, how it is in this age of modern chemistry and near nanotechnology that highway asphalt is vulnerable to this type of damage.)</p>
<p>(One also wonders where the #$@! the local police forces and the CHP were during last night's commute because they sure as heck were not out helping smooth the alternate traffic routes on, say, El Camino Real.)</p>
<p>This morning the BST limo took a delayed departure over the alternate routing on 280 and 92 in a reasonably successful attempt to minimize travel time. A co-worker coming from Milpitas did not and so arrived 30 minutes after me despite leaving earlier. Uggh!</p>
<p>I was reminded of the long ago days when I commuted from New Jersey to Manhattan and several times PATH service was disrupted. Yesterday might have been bad but barely knee high to those disasters.</p>
