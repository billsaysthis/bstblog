<p>From <a href="http://chutry.wordherders.net/archives/004874.html">the chutry experiment</a>, a meme. Generally I don't find these things interesting but was curious to see what mine turned out.</p>
<p>RULES:
<ol>
<li>Go into your archive.</li>
<li>Find your 23rd post (or closest to it).</li>
<li>Find the fifth sentence (or closest to it).</li>
<li>Post the text of the sentence in your blog along with these instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's mine: "Of course, the Fed historically hasn't been too interested in the stock market; many observers have pointed out that the Fed's move on rates are generally intended to put money in the pockets of the bond markets."
