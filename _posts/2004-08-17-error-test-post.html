<p>I am getting an odd error trying to republish an edited post:</p>
<p>550 www/2004/08/isnt-he-bit-like-you-and-me.phtml: No such file or directory on file:www/2004/08/isnt-he-bit-like-you-and-me.phtml</p>
<p>I might understand this problem if I had the per post pages enabled, but I don't. This happens on any post I try to edit and republish. If you don't see this entry then it means the problem applies to new posts as well.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> If you can read this then the problem is corrected. I suppose.</p>
<p><em>Update, next night:</em> Can you read this?<br /></p>
