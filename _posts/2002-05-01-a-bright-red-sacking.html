<p>Oh see the dirty papers sweeping across the vaguely empty parking lot<br />
<br />Past lonely steel grey posts and fractured white painted lines?<br />
<br />Say by five o'clock tonight we can meet for some hot tea and a pastry<br />
<br />At Dana's, the little place where Ewen wrote his set of ditties.</p>
<p>Can the ready crew before you leave for the day, they've outlasted<br />
<br />Their usefulness and Carrie wants them gone straight away.<br />
<br />You, Dawn's place, with George, get going and figure out how to<br />
<br />Tell them the time has come to hit the highway, no hard feelings.</p>
<p>Early on, I thought the bunch would stick with us to the warm, green end<br />
<br />Too bad that Irwin is the only one who showed us the real stuff.<br />
<br />Light touch, good sense of where we need to put always short resources<br />
<br />The rest seem stuck in the firework's light and unwilling to move in tune.</p>
<p>What's so hard to understand is Francis' reluctance, he's not done in<br />
<br />As much as Harrison and Natalie, but he keeps chuffing and whining,<br />
<br />Proudly, as if his claim to stick is any better than the rest have put up.<br />
<br />Anyway, I'm gonna spring for the cheer-you-up later at Dana's.</p>
