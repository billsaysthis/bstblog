<p><strong>Buy Bill a holiday present?</strong></p>
<p>One word: <a href="http://www.sharpusa.com/sharp-usa/be-sharp/showcase/0,1941,100-0-0,00.html">Aquos</a>, only $1,799.99 for the 15" model or $2,999.99 for the 20" model from BestBuy but that includes free shipping. This is a lightweight (8.5 lbs.), skinny (2.5"), portable high performance flat screen Liquid Crystal Television from Sharp--sweet! Other bloggers have been known to post links to their Amazon wishlists or other donation/gift systems but I can't really see any point to that. Aquos just looks so good you have to want it! Don't you?<br /></p>
