<p>Well, in keeping with how far from reality my weekend sports dream was, the Niners are blowing chunks early. Completely unable to take advantage of a huge Jimmy Williams punt return or a midfield interception, the Cowboys lead 6-0 on two field goals early in the second quarter. Not a single touch at all for Terrell Owens!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, yesterday Liverpool FC made some serious lineup changes, Kirkland for Dudek most prominent, yet <a href="http://liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N137955021207-1655.htm">still lost 2-0</a> to lowly Charlton and lost Emile Heskey in the 37th minute to a leg injury. The Reds slip to fourth in the Premiership following their eight straight League match without a victory.</p>
<p>No better result on the college football front either. Miami slipped by Virginia Tech to retain their number one ranking and spot opposite Ohio State in the fiesta Bowl for the national title, Georgia wiped the field with Arkansas, and Jason Gesser ignored his sprained ankle to lead Washington State to the automatic PAC-10 Rose Bowl berth. USC should keep fourth place in the BCS ranks, and an automatic major bowl bid, but their opponent and destination (Oklahoma in the Sugar Bowl?) will not be known for another 90 minutes.</p>
<p>We can only hope the 49ers get something going while the defense holds tight on the Cowboys to get the potentially division-clinching win.</p>
<p><em>Update, 1:40 PST:</em> With a last second touchdown grab by (who else?) Terrell Owens, the 49ers came back and won 31-27. Combined with the Rams' disaster in Kansas City, San Francisco clinched the NFC West. Next up: Green Bay comes to visit and a win in this game means we probably don't have to go to their house if the teams meet in the playoffs. But the defense has to be a lot--a lot!--stronger than they were today. Kevan Barlow or Garrison Hearst or both need to be healthy by Sunday. And Owens needs to get the ball earlier and much more often.</p>
<p><em>Update, 2:32 PST:</em> The non-championship matchup that I'd hoped for is <a href="http://msn.espn.go.com/ncf/news/2002/1208/1473541.html">now set</a>. It's in the Orange Bowl instead of the Rose Bowl, but you can bet I'll be watching USC take on Iowa on January 2. A facet of the selection rules gives the bowl with a higher payout first choice of available teams, giving the Orange two selections before the Sugar, which wanted USC, had any. One loss Georgia can bite my ass, the winner of the Orange Bowl will end the year ranked higher. And let's have a big woohoo for the BCS selectors for leaving Notre Dame on the outside looking in.</p>
