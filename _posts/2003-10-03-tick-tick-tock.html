<p>The clock says 4:00 Friday but why do I feel like its 4:00 Saturday? Probably from reading too many stories like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/03/opinion/03KRUG.html">this one</a> and <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/developer/0,39020387,39116902,00.htm">this one</a>. And especially the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20031002.html">latest from Cringely</a>, even though he is often way overblown.</p>
