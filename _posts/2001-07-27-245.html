<p><b>Today's movie: America's Sweethearts</b><br />

<p>Basically, I will see any movie with <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~dholaday/cusack/" title="Apparently he doesn't have his own site">John Cusack</a> in it and almost any movie with <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a3ab237747117.htm">Julia Roberts</a>. Billy Crystal, who wrote and produced this film, if he's being funny. So it was only a matter of time (six days actually) until I saw <a href="http://www.mediatrip.com/americassweethearts/">America's Sweethearts</a>, a sweet, funny movie. Christopher Walken makes a short but potent appearance at the end as the director of the movie-within-a-movie that is the point of America's Sweethearts and he turns everything upside down.</p>
<p>This film had a <a href="http://www.the-numbers.com/people/JOHNC.html" title="scroll down to the bottom of this page for numbers">bigger opening weekend</a> (that is, had a higher take at the box office) than any of Cusack's previous films, even <a href="http://movies.go.com/movies/C/conair_1997/index.html">Con Air</a> but this is probably due more to Robert's pull. It is apparently the <a href="http://www.juliafan.com/jrmov$.htm" title="scroll down to the bottom of this page for numbers">second biggest opening</a> for her.</p>
