<p><b>Tears</b></p>
<p>There are no words to express my sadness and anger at the animals who <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/nyTimesHomeBombing7AM2.gif">perpetrated this horror</a>. A friend said:</p>
<p>"A lot of people in the world think that the US is effect and bourgeouis and isn't willing to fight. They're going to find out now, the hard way.</p>
<p>I'm sure that the Taliban has been told through diplomatic channels already that the US wants bin Laden, wants him NOW and wants no more excuses or delays. I suspect they've got 24 hours before bombing starts. There will be no negotiation, no half measures, no conditions, nothing less accepted.</p>
<p>We have B-52's at Diego Garcia which could launch an attack with six hours notice, and after Iraq and Serbia, everyone in the world knows how devastating a US air campaign can be."</p>
