<p><strong>Why Australians are so cool</strong></p>
<p>The Sydney Morning Herald has a set of beautiful <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/0201/01/gallery/snapshot1.html">New Year's Celebration photos</a> showing the Aussies partying hard, nearly a million of them, as <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/0201/02/national/national1.html">fires rage around the city</a> covering it with a layer of smoke. That's what I called laid back!</p>
