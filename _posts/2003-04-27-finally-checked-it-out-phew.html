<p>One of my neighbors' cars has a personalized license plate of webjnky. The frame for it says www. on the top and .com on the bottom. For months I've walked passed this VW Passat and said to myself I should go see if there really is such a site. I mean, who's a web junky if not me? Maybe the URL has the missing 'u', maybe not. First I tried with the 'u' but that just resolved to a domain seller site--perhaps, I thought, the neighbor let his lease expire. In order to be certain, I tried <a href="http://www.webjnky.com/">www.webjnky.com</a> and sure enough he was there, not much content excpet lots of pictures of VW Passats, but then maybe he's obsessed. There are worse things. Mainly, I'm glad to have finally satisfied my curiousity. Without killing a cat.</p>
