<p>So the wizards at CBS have done it again. This is the network with the oldest demographic and having just turned 48 I shouldn't be surprised that more of its shows are getting on my list. <span style="font-style:italic;">NCIS</span>, for instance, who can resist Mark Harmon as a hardcase?
<div></div>
<div>I saw the two episode backdoor pilot they ran a few weeks ago featuring LL Cool J and Chris O'Donnell and wasn't shocked to see "NCIS Spinoff" listed on the likely CBS Fall schedule. Sure enough this got a pick up but with what name? <span style="font-style:italic;">NCIS: Los Angeles</span>! I know older folks prefer simplicity and the naming pattern seems to have done the network well with <span style="font-style:italic;">CSI: Wherever</span> but still?!?! On the good side, I suppose this means we won't be getting a CSI: LA.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The team is part of NCIS's Office of Special Projects which, unlike Harmon's team, does mainly undercover investigations plus they have much newer tech toys. I was hoping the series would be called OSP but what can you do?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Don't forget, <span style="font-style:italic;">NCIS</span> is itself a spinoff from the late, unlamented <span style="font-style:italic;">JAG</span>. Acronyms must be another simplification us old coots prefer.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-weight:bold;">Other CBS</span></div>
<div>
<div></div>
<div>The producers at <span style="font-style:italic;">Without a Trace</span> must have realized the jig was up. Props to them for getting Danny and Elena married, resolving the Jack/Samantha/Brian triangle well and not leaving anyone hanging off a cliff.</div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:italic;">Numb3rs</span> was allegedly on the bubble but will be back and no surprise so will <span style="font-style:italic;">The Mentalist</span>, though moved to Thursdays at 10. If you haven't been watching this one, give it a look as its one of the most 'fun' police dramas in a long time.</div>
</div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span style="font-weight:bold;">Elsewhere</span></div>
<div></div>
<div>[Note: The Futon Critic has all the gory details, which you may want to start with at this <a href="http://www.futoncritic.com/guide.aspx?id=fall_2009">Fall '09 schedule chart</a>.]</div>
<div></div>
<div>NBC did pick up <span style="font-style:italic;">Chuck</span>, hurray! Only 13 episodes and it will timeshare Mondays at 8 with <span style="font-style:italic;">Heroes</span>, meaning the latter will not get an increase of the announced 19 episode order and Mr. Bartowski won't be returning until March. Earl won't get to finish his list of amends as the never quite funny enough <span style="font-style:italic;">My Name is Earl</span> is done.</div>
<div></div>
<div>While I have been a loyal <span style="font-style:italic;">Law &amp; Order</span> viewer the entire 19 year year I think the show has more than run its course and would have much preferred to see <span style="font-style:italic;">Life</span> renewed and paired with <span style="font-style:italic;">Southland</span>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Fox did renew <span style="font-style:italic;">Lie to Me</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Fringe</span>, very nice thank you, but unfortunately chose <span style="font-style:italic;">Dollhouse</span> over <span style="font-style:italic;">Sarah Connor Chronicles</span>. While the former has pretty much everything you would think I like--Joss Whedon, Eliza Dushku, semi-science fiction plus action plot--I watched the first couple of episodes and snored.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-style:italic;">Lie to Me</span> was generally compared to <span style="font-style:italic;">Mentalist</span> for the similarity of the lead characters but over the course of their first seasons showed themselves to be very different in practice.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Tuesdays will be strange for those of us who generally dislike reality fare, as ABC, NBC and Fox will all be showing 'unscripted' series in the 8-10 block. Fortunately CBS will have the <span style="font-style:italic;">NCIS/NCIS: LA</span> pair during that time.</div>
