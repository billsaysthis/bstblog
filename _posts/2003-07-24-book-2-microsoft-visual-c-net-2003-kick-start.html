<p>I finished Herb Schildt's <em>C#: A Beginner's Guide</em> on Tuesday and almost right on schedule cracked open book 2 in my self-paced programming class, <a href="http://www.samspublishing.com/catalog/product.asp?product_id={C5F1F7CE-0E7A-470B-A23A-49B168F8590F}">Microsoft Visual C# .NET 2003 Kick Start</a>, this morning. Read all of chapter one, in which author Steven Holzner covers nearly half the material Schildt managed in his entire book, though Holzner does skip the pop quizzes and pages of useless source code demonstrating value types. While I never could find a website for Schildt, I'm almost sorry I found <a href="http://www.lightlink.com/steve/">Holzner's</a> but fortunately the book seems like a much better example of his writing.</p>
