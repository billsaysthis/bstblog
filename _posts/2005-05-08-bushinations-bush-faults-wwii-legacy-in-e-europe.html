<p>So GWB heads over the pond to attend some celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the end of WWII and while there <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/07/AR2005050701232.html">faults the legacy in Eastern Europe</a>, the acquiesence of America and the allies to Soviet annexations and dominations. Never again, Bush says, will we be "appeasing or excusing tyranny, and sacrificing freedom in the vain pursuit of stability."</p>
<p>The thing I'd like to know, given this assertion, is how he'll answer questions about our relationship with such bastions of freedom as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia--I wanted to come up with a third example that's both (a) meaningful and (b) not another Muslim country but these days there are very few non-Islamic countries which are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship">out and out dictatorships</a> or monarchies. Still, I'm sure you see the direct conflict between the President's words and his actions.</p>
