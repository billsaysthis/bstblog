<p>Dan <a href="http://www.lakefx.nu/archive/2002_08_11_index.html#80298288">acknowledges</a> that <a href="http://www.jamesbond.com/mmpr/ms/mmpr_ms_ohmss.html#1">On Her Majesty's Secret Service</a> is not only underrated but perhaps the best Bond film of all, which is just what I said in <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_03_03_blog_archive.phtml#75002348">my review</a>, and points to <a href="http://byzantiumshores.blogspot.com/2002_08_04_byzantiumshores_archive.html#80074882">Jaquandor's series</a> reviewing <em>all 19</em> Bond films (plus Never Say Never Again, but not including Casino Royale), in which Jaquandor also names OHMSS the top 007. Why, you ask? This is something I had difficulty putting my finger on but he <a href="http://byzantiumshores.blogspot.com/2002_08_04_byzantiumshores_archive.html#79819994">gets to the point</a>: "Where so many Bond films a[re] faux-epics, mistaking huge sets and massive battles for grandeur, OHMSS gets it right by telling an epic story."</p>
