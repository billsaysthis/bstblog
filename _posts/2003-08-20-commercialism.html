<p>Yes, those are Google AdSense ads you now see on top of the content column on the pages of this website. Feel to click through and help me earn a few dollars. You might also want to help out by starting your Amazon shopping by clicking the "Shop Here" button on the top left of the BST homepage. Hopefully these small efforts will help pay for the incidentals around the house while my job search continues into its--yes--third year. I'm also starting a selling program on eBay and if you don't have enough books, CDs, beanie babies and the like already, feel free to bid as I put them up for sale.</p>
