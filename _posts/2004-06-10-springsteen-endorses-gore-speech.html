<p>The Boss, usually one to avoid explicit public political activity, agrees so strongly with the very pointed speech Al Gore made recently that he posted it <a href="http://brucespringsteen.net/news/index.html" title="Note the generic URL, not sure how longlived this will be">to his own website</a> with the following introduction:</p>
<p><em>"A few weeks ago at N.Y.U. Al Gore gave one of the most important speeches I've heard in a long time. The issues it raises need to be considered by every American concerned with the direction our country is headed in. It's my pleasure to reprint it here for my fans."</em></p>
