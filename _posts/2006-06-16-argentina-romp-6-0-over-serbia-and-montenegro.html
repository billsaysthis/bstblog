<p>This morning <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/">Garret</a> linked to articles about <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/art+books/books/a-theory-of-idleness/13759/">idle theory</a> and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/15/AR2006061501790.html">the purpose-driven life</a> but in the day's early game in Germany, there was no doubt that Argentina is a believer in the latter as they <a href="http://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/06/06/16/manual_145048.html&amp;TEAMHD=soccer">won 6-0</a>, destroying over Serbia and Montenegro in the next to last game that will be played under that name (voters in Montenegro approved plans a couple of weeks ago to become their own nation).</p>
<p>The South Americans got on the board first on a threading pass in the box from Javier Saviola to Maxie Rodriguez, second from a beautiful backheel by Hernan Crespo to Esteban Cambiasso and closed the first half with Rodriguez getting a second off a Saviola rebound. The former Yugoslav side came out looking a bit more determined in the opening minutes of the second half but that energy quickly dissipated when they were unable to make any offensive headway and completely fell apart after former Chelsea striker Mateja Kezman was sent off on a straight red for putting both feet up into defender Mascherano.</p>
<p>Jose Peckerman brought on strikers Carlos Tevez and Lionel Messi, who made or scored the last three goals. Can you imagine a team so deep that the third and fourth strikers are a three time South American player of the year and an 18 year old pushing his way into the starting XI of European club champions Barcelona? Netherlands kick off a must win match with Cote D'Ivoire in 15 minutes, and if they do win will need to beat Argentina in what will be an awesome last group round match because somehow I doubt a draw will get them first place--Argentina's goal differential is seven and no way will the Dutch be plus six against a strong African side.</p>
<p>What an awesome display of power and fluidity! The losers might as well have not come back out from the locker room at halftime. And I can only hope that Landon Donovan and Bruce Arena were watching closely and taking inspiration for tomorrow.</p>
