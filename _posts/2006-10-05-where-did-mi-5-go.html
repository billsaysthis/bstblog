<p>A&amp;E had been airing this classy British spy show (called <span style="font-style:italic;">Spooks</span> in the original BBC broadcasts)  and I was happy to see many promos touting its return for season four a couple of weeks ago, even at the Friday night at 11 timeslot. With TiVo who really cares about the timeslot? But then it was recorded last week and no episodes are showing on the to be recorded list either.</p>
<p>The A&amp;E website still has a page for MI-5 but the space under Schedule is blank. Since they have a discussions forum I checked it for news and sure enough the network has pulled it, with no notice or announcement, after only two episodes. Hey, at least they showed the second one since it was the conclusion of a fairly intense Earth First terrorist story.</p>
<p>Oddly, they're running a poll on the discussion home page on how unhappy fans are about this; right now the tallies are 164 for very upset, 3 for upset, 1 for annoyed and 1 for okay to wait. Given that one most register on the site to vote the results seem to indicate fairly serious displeasure, as do almost all the comments on all the recent discussion threads.</p>
<p>The remaining eight episodes of season four will apparently be blown off in a marathon block on Saturday, Oct. 21. No word on seasons five, which has just aired in the UK, or six, which will begin filming in a few months.</p>
