<p>Continuing their recent run of underwhelming performances--you should have seen the humiliation Chelsea handed them two days ago!--Manchester United <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4933770.stm">managed only a scoreless draw</a> with Middlesbrough today on their own field. They truly missed Wayne Rooney, who will also surely be missed by England's World Cup squad next month in Germany, as the van Nistelrooy/Saha partnership produced nothing and RvN couldn't beat a backup keeper on a penalty shot. Boro is probably ecstatic to have earned the away point, suffered no injuries and kept themselves in high gear ahead of their <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/middlesbrough/4954154.stm">UEFA Cup final</a> a week from Wednesday against Spanish side Sevilla.</p>
<p>While the point technically puts them one ahead of my Reds in the table, the clubs are now even on games played with only one remaining. Wouldn't it have been sweet if they were meeting at the weekend? The scheduling elves weren't that kind and so Sunday has ManU hosting Charlton while LFC travel to Portsmouth. Still, while I won't make a forecast, if we win and the Red Devils do not second place is ours. A month ago I didn't think it would be even possible so no matter the outcome, cheers to Gerrard and Co.</p>
<p>And of course the following Saturday is the season capper, the FA Cup final against West Ham. Who we beat 2-1 last Wednesday albeit with  both sides fielding very different starting XIs than we'll see in Millenium Stadium.</p>
<p>GO REDS!</p>
