<p>Wow, this was a weird movie, the kind you watch and then ask yourself where the fuck did writer/director/lead actor <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Schaeffer,+Eric">Eric Schaeffer</a> come up with this? <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0153866">Wirey Spindell</a> is an autobiography of someone named Wirey Spindell, the child of hippies, a kid who doesn't make it to age seven without becoming a sexual predator, who shuttles from school to divorced parent to elsewhere, always fueled by drugs, alcohol, and sex. Until, in college, he realizes that he either stops or dies. And so he goes into rehab and gives up the toxins...and the sex. Until he meets the lovely Callie Thorne (who was a detective towards the end of <em>Homicide: Life on the Streets</em>). Schaeffer tells this story through flashbacks, with three actors playing his younger self, until we get back to the present. Let's just pray this wasn't his autobiography.</p>
<p><em>Recommended if you like weird artsy films</em></p>
