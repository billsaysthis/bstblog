<p><b>Looking at how we may fight</b></p>
<p>Barton Gellman writes in the Washington Post that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A37967-2001Sep15.html">Images of Past Wars May Not Fit Present Foe</a>. This article is one of the most insightful I've seen yet that explores the details of responding with force to last Tuesday's events. The ending is ominous: there will be more attacks on US soil and no matter how much we stiffen up, not all will be caught and stopped. This will be a long, long campaign.</p>
<p>Key quote: "Peter Feaver, a Duke University political scientist, said the Bush administration appears to regard this conflict as the defining feature of the present international environment. 'Like the Cold War, this is a realigning war, by which I mean that the United States is dividing the world into us versus them,' he said."<br /></p>
