<p><b>Guns don't kill people--Don't think so!</b>
<p><a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010322/ts/crime_shootings_dc_6.html">Teen Gunman Shoots Seven at High School</a> is the latest in a series of these terrible tragedies that are happening more and more frequently. Good thing we have <a href="http://www.redshift.com/~jamesm2/2nda2.htm">the NRA to protect our rights</a> to own guns. Because then where would these kids get the guns to bring to school?</p>
<p>Seriously, these school shootings sadden me terribly. And, in response, people call for tighter gun ownership laws, trigger locks, and the like. However, the <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/1999/08/12/nra/">NRA is so powerful</a> nothing useful ever gets passed. And the killings continue.</p>
