<p>The boys in Bristol screwed me over last night, switching coverage of the Denmark-England game from ESPN to ESPN2. So Tivo recorded a couple of hours of SportsCenter. Instead of an exciting 3-0 win for England featuring goals from both the Liverpool strikers, Owen and Heskey. <em>Dayum!</em></p>
