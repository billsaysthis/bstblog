<p>If you've sent me email in the last 36-48 hours, I probably haven't seen it. I filed a problem ticket but being this is a holiday here in the US, I don't expect any help until tomorrow. You can also try me on first initial (b) lastname at hotmail.com (all one squashed word). HTTP service, since you're reading this, doesn't seem to be affected.</p>
