<p>The Reds went to Birmingham for the FA Cup quarterfinal match and--no kidding--<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/4820136.stm">scored seven goals</a>. A clean sheet is one thing but Liverpool simply humiliated the brummy bandits. First goal came after 54 <em>seconds</em> and the second after four minutes, headers by Hyypia and Crouch, then Crouch kicked in a second at 38 minutes on a sweet pass from Gerrard (who else?) before going off at 55. His replacement, Morientes, scored the fourth a couple of minutes later and John Arne Riise unleashed a trademark left foot blast from 25 yeards at the left side of the box. To make misery complete one of the defenders let in an own goal for the sixth and Djibrille Cisse, determined to get in on the action, splashed the seventh just before the death. Another bit of good news was the return of Momo Sissoko from nearly losing his eye last month in Portugal. After hardly being able to score for months the team has now scored 15 in their last three matches. On to the derby with Everton Saturday, the featured early show on FSC!</p>
