<p>Marc Forster, the director of <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/movies/2003/03/monsters-ball">Monster's Ball</a> and <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/movies/2006/11/stranger-than-fiction">Stranger than Fiction</a>, has signed on to direct Daniel Craig and company in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0830515/">Bond 22</a>. There have been hints that this will be an explicit sequel to <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/movies/2006/12/casino-royale-2006">Casino Royale</a>, with 007 going after the villain who masterminded it's machinationsâ€”maybe even a renewed Ernst Blofeld? There are no more Ian Fleming novels left to adapt, and none of the estate-authorized sequels penned by John Gardner et al seemed to have made enough impact to be considered.</p>
<p>A new director frequently means yet another round of rewrites, and perhaps even deeper changes, though the window for them is brief since production must begin soon if the plan to release the movie on November 7 of next year is to be met.</p>
<p>Forster is definitely an interesting, unexpected choice whose never done an action picture before. He has ranged widely, though; in addition to the two above I've seen he also directed Johnny Depp in the JM Barrie biopic <span style="font-style:italic;">Finding Neverland</span>, a psychological thriller called <span style="font-style:italic;">Stay</span> with Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts and has the adaptation of the bestselling novel <a href="http://www.kiterunnermovie.com/">The Kite Runner</a> due out this November.</p>
