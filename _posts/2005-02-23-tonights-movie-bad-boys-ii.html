<p>This time around Will Smith and Martin Lawrence (does anyone call him Marty to his face?) get a much bigger budget for their Miami drug cop action comedy. That means lots more big booms, crashes and massive quantities of bullets flying in <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/badboys2/site/">Bad Boys II</a> but what they didn't invest enough in was a scriptwriter. Hollywood vet Ron Shelton and Jerry Stahl (who wrote up his addiction and recovery in <em>Permanent Midnight</em>) have both done quality work but neither has delivered an <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0329717/">action success</a>.</p>
<p>Michael Bay had his first directing success with the original <span style="font-style:italic;">Boys</span> back in 1995 and certainly knows his way around this kind of movie. Press reports, though, have been talking lately about his desire to move onto more challenging types of work and <span style="font-style:italic;">Boys II</span> seems like the result of a contract he had to fulfill. Like I said, the huge budget certainly shows on screen but its hollow.</p>
<p>Over the top doesn't begin to describe how ridiculous the movie is. Drugs and money shipped inside corpses. Rats infesting piles of drug money. DEA, FBI, CIA agents teamed up with Miami cops and Cuban dissidents to raid a home in Cuba and fight off Cuban military, all off the books.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">not recommended</span></p>
