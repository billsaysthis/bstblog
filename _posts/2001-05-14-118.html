<p><b>Why we're here</b><br />

<p>No, not a scientific breakthrough that will replace/correct/validate religious assertions on the creation of the Universe/Multiverse but instead <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1330000/1330190.stm">the secret of matter discovered</a>. The question: if, when the Universe was born, shouldn't matter and antimatter been created in equal numbers and then all of it destroyed in collisions between the two? If all particles adhered precisely to the <a href="http://www.alcyone.com/max/physics/laws/c.html">law of conservation</a>, then yes, kaboom and no more particles. But apparently "there is a tiny difference between matter and antimatter that left a bit of matter remaining, out of which galaxies, stars, and you and I formed." Scientists found a tiny difference in the decay rates between matter and antimatter, though, and that was enough to leave enough left to create what we <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3" title="NASA's Earth Observatory publishes lots of great images of the Big Blue Marble">see around us</a>.</p>
