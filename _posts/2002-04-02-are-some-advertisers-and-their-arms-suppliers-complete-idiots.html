<p>Or just total morons? Check out <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/2980593.htm">Get ready for advertisers to take over your Web browser</a>. If this ridiculous product becomes available, the web will take another step towards the sad and useless. This is what I wrote to the vendor's CEO today:</p>
<p>I hope what I've read this morning regarding your new product with the strange name is not true and just some April Fools prank. If this browser hijacking is what you expect to sell, I hope you are prepared for a huge negative backlash. Personally, I would not knowingly visit any site that implements this, I would write any sites I currently read that do implement your product to alert them as to why I no longer visit, and I would recommend to my friends and online communities that they do the same. There are enough tools including JavaScript, Flash, and so forth to implement desirable functions inside a web page that redesigning my (and I emphasize MY) browser is excessive and unnecessary.</p>
<p>I hope you are getting many emails and communications similar to mine, enough that you will rethink this folly and refocus your company's efforts on a more useful product.</p>
