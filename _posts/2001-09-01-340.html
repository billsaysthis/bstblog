<p><b>Today's movie: Rat Race</b></p>
<p>A goofy bunch of losers are gathered by eccentric Vegas casino owner (Monty Python's John Cleese) to race 660 miles for a gym bag filled with $2 million in <a href="http://www.ratracemovie.com/flash_site/index_flash.html">Rat Race</a>. We laughed a lot. This is a throwback to movies like Cannonball Run (remember Jackie Chan in that one?) done surprisingly well. <a href="http://www.sethgreenonline.com/main.htm">Seth Green</a> and Vince Vieluf as the Cody Brothers have a lot of the best laughs although Amy Smart's helicopter pilot has the best scene buzzing her no-good boyfriends backyard pool. Except for maybe Cuba Gooding's time driving a bus full of Lucy Ricardo fans. There's almost no foul language or sexual material, so this flick is recommended even for kids.</p>
