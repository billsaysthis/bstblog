<p>I saw a very different guitar player this afternoon on PBS live music series <a href="http://www.sierranevada.com/sierracenterstage/index.html">Sierra Center Stage</a>, an Aussie named <a href="http://www.tommyemmanuel.com/tommy.htm">Tommy Emmanuel</a> who played a set of acoustic instrumentals that used his guitar as a percussion kit as much as a normal guitar. A lot of energy, a lot of creativity. He ended with a song called <a href="http://www.tommyemmanuel.com/new/Discographie/initiation.html" title="Title track of this 1995 release">Initiation</a> that was really intense, very deep, though he introduced it as telling a story that I could not connect to what I heard at all. Nice change of pace, for sure.</p>
<p>Note that his website uses a very poor design but you can listen to his music by clicking the "his TUNES" image at the bottom right, clicking on an album title and then on a song title. Or cheat and <a href="http://www.tommyemmanuel.com/new/Tune_Choice.htm">click here</a> to go straight to his discography.</p>
