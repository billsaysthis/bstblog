<p>Wow! We had a great meeting last night. I was a bit nervous beforehand, not having received many RSVPs, but the turnout was more than enough to fill the seats and we had to steal a half dozen chairs from the next room over. The discussion, on the implications for security and privacy in an always-on world, was really good too and would have gone on much longer but I could see a few yawns and watch checks, better to end when people are still involved than falling asleep.</p>
<p>Major thanks to <a href="http://www.eff.org/about/staff/?f=cindy_cohn.html">Cindy Cohn</a> of the EFF and newly-independent open source ambassador <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/">Chris Messina</a> for coming and sharing their expertise and experience and to security maven Phil Burton for moderating and more. Thanks also to Steve Levine, Barry Kramer and Dante Billups of <a href="http://www.fenwick.com/">Fenwick &amp; West</a> for arranging our use of their lovely conference center in Mountain View.</p>
<p>Aside from pointing out the obviously less vulnerable Mac and Linux platforms, the key takeaway was use these new gadgets and services, use the web, but do it from a protected setup and with both eyes open because the attacks use both technology and social engineering to try and separate you from your money and other valuable resources.</p>
<p>(<span style="font-style:italic;">Ed. Note:</span> When people talk about OS X being more secure, and not just because the smaller number of machines is not a tempting target, <a href="http://maccult.blogspot.com/2006/05/key-isolation-features-in-mac-os-x.html">this article</a> from the Cult of Mac is a good technical explanation of what they mean.)</p>
<p>Chris specifically suggested that Windows users start by installing the following free, mostly open source products:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a>: web browsing</li>
<li><a href="http://www.grisoft.com/doc/289/lng/us/tpl/tpl01">AVG</a>: antivirus (but boy do they try and convince you to buy a slightly different version!)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/company/products/znalm/freeDownload.jsp?dc=12bms&amp;ctry=US&amp;lang=en&amp;lid=staticcomp_za">ZoneAlert</a>: firewall (the free personal edition)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>: email</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these four applications instead of the Microsoft equivalents will reduce vulnerabilities substantially.</p>
<p>All in all, I'm very happy and looking forward to the next JHTC meeting, which will be in Tuesday, July 11, at the Fenwick &amp; West conference center in Mountain View. The evening's program and guest will be announced in the next week or ten days (keep your fingers crossed).</p>
