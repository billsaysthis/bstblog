<p>Interesting. The NY Post <a href="http://www.nypost.com/business/879.htm">is reporting</a> that the hostess with the mostest, Bad Martha herself, may have not only made $45,000 improper profit on the sale of Imclone stock but a much larger profit by selling off shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia (MSO) while knowing that her company's stock would dive when news of the insider trading became public. She sold 3,000,000 at $15 per share in a deal that languished for many moons before coming to fruition just before the bad news came to light.</p>
<p>And who stepped up with the 45 Large to put in her tasteful pockets? None other than the investment company headed by the man who assumed the chairperson's position at MSO when Stewart stepped down. A private transaction rather then just putting the shares into the open market. Sounds hincky to me though in truth many executives sell company stock regularly (like Bill Gates) or once in a blue moon (like Gate's number two Steve Ballmer) to diversify their portfolio. Her <a href="http://davezilla.com/index.php?p=1755&amp;c=1">troubles</a> may be a lot bigger than first thought.</p>
