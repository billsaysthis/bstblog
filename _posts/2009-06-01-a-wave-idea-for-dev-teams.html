<div><a href="http://wave.google.com/">Google Wave</a> has really caught my attention the last few days. Vidar Hokstad's post <a href="http://www.hokstad.com/google-wave-as-infrastructure.html">Google Wave as Infrastructure</a> was very insightful and inspiring.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here is a thought of mine of a way to use Wave in software development, as a sophisticated project center. A dynamic gathering place of practical types of content. Something people suggested wikis might be good for when wikis first started appearing.</div>
<div></div>
<div>My illustration below is not intended to be exhaustive but just a thought piece since, of course, it would require many types of applications to get Wave-enabled. That will take time and software execs with belief.</div>
