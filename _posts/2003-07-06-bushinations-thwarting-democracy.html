<p>Novelist <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/features/smiley/author.html">Jane Smiley</a> sent in a short but sweet letter to the editor at the NY Times today and, contrary to usual practice, I'll reproduce it here:</p>
<p><em>Maybe once was a fluke — the 2000 presidential election — but now it's beginning to look like a pattern. Representative Tom DeLay is trying to force Texas to gerrymander before the next House election, and the Republicans in the California Legislature are holding Gov. Gray Davis hostage to a recall (news article, July 2).</p>
<p>It looks as if the G.O.P. has decided not to abide by the duly registered wishes of the voters, but to attempt every means to overturn elections that go to Democrats. <strong>Are we living in the third world? Is the United Nations going to have to send in election watchers to make sure we have free and fair elections?</strong></p>
<p>Wake up, America! Your government is being stolen right out from under your noses by the right wing. It not only can happen here, it is happening here.</em></p>
<p>The sentences emphasized with bold are to me one of the key questions about <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_06_29_blog_archive.phtml#105726997967096944">what's going on</a> these days. The speeches and actions coming out of the GWB posse are such <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/06/opinion/06WILS.html">a load of crap</a> that I'm increasingly challenged to understand current poll results. What, I wonder, is so broken with the Democratic Party that they can't take advantage of such blatant behavior?</p>
