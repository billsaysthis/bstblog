<p>Presumably the same fraudsters <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_03_07_blog_archive.phtml#107902271683168089">who tried</a> to auction off my now-sold <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/telecaster/tele_incase_big.jpg">Telecaster</a> on eBay are <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=3713025611&amp;category=38083&amp;sspagename=rvi:1:1">at it again</a>. When I wrote about their previous effort, at least one person who was about to be relieved of some serious cash was caught in time, perhaps this will help once more.</p>
<p>Further, instead of just the best reporting facility I could find on eBay's site, which only allowed me to submit the suspect auction number into a black hole, this time I wrote an email to the one person working at eBay whom I've met. <a href="http://www.alpern.org/weblog">Micah</a> is not in that part of the company but I'm hoping he can connect me to someone who is.</p>
<p>I don't know the alleged seller, <a href="http://cgi2.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback&amp;userid=ralphpacini55&amp;item=3713025611&amp;frompage=284&amp;de=off&amp;fromasq=1">ralphpacini55</a>, but the person who almost got shivved last time forwarded the email he recieved with payment instructions. Which, despite the location being listed in the auction as somewhere in Canada, called for a money order to be sent to a man right here in the South Bay, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22Peter+Bijlsma%22+%2B%22los+gatos%22" title="Google doesn't turn up any web pages but does list the same address given in the payment email plus a telephone number...">Peter Bijlsma</a> in Los Gatos. If any of you know this person, please tell him to stop trying to sell a guitar he doesn't own, okay? Thanks.</p>
