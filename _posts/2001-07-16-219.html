<p><b>Today's movie: The Score</b><br />

<p>Bob Graham, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/13/DD168924.DTL&amp;type=movies">writing in the SF Chronicle</a>, gave <a href="http://www.thescoremovie.com/">The Score</a> a very positive review. My parents gave it a glowing report. I went with two of my friends and we all were looking for rusty railroad spikes to drive through our heads to end the agony. This is a Hollywood heist movie, like <a href="http://www.mgm.com/thethomascrownaffair/">The Thomas Crown Affair</a>, and the key to a successful heist flick is a continual ratcheting up of the tension (such as when Rene Russo accompanies Pierce Brosnan to his Caribbean hideaway) but director (and Miss Piggy/Yoda voiceman) <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Oz,+Frank">Frank Oz</a> never gives us any tension to ratchet up until almost the very end, which he then ignores for the remaining 90 seconds of the film. Don't be surprised when Brando first comes on screen: he's bulked up and looks like an <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hc&amp;id=1800023585&amp;cf=pg&amp;photoid=196803">orca in a bad suit</a>. Not recommended!</p>
