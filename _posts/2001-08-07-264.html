<p><b>Tonight's TV: NEXT: The Future Just Happened</b><br />

<p>A and E broadcast part one (of two) of Michael Lewis documentary <a href="http://www.aande.com/tv/shows/future/">NEXT: The Future Just Happened</a>. Oddly, I'd just written on the book version <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/2001_07_22_blog_archive.phtml#4694054">a couple of weeks ago</a>. Still haven't read the book but decided to watch the show. The problem, at least with part one, is that it's too much of a <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=mishmash">mishmash</a>, going from teens doing adult things on the 'Net to a roundtable with old fogie lawyers (one of whom happens to be Lewis's dad) to a town in Ireland that is possibly that most heavily wired of any in the world. Yes, Michael, the Internet is changing things immensely. We get it. I don't think I'll make it to part two tonight.</p>
<p>The NY Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/06/arts/television/06GENZ.html">weighs in on the show</a>.</p>
