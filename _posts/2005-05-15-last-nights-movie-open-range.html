<p>Geez, been awhile since I watched a whole movie. Possibly <a href="http://video.movies.go.com/openrange/">Open Range</a> (released in 2003) wasn't the right choice to break my dry spell. Kevin Costner and Robert Duval are old school cattle drivers, taking advantage of legal permission to graze their herds on open spaces. Or open ranges, that's probably part of where <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316356/">the title</a> comes from. Trouble comes in the form of a rancher (Michael Gambon) who doesn't care for the men or the competition.</p>
<p>Costner also directed, using a script by Craig Storper from Lauran Paine's decades old novel <em>The Open Range Men</em>. As the film opens, Duval, Costner and two younger hands are settling in for the night with a thin tarp sheltering them from a torrential downpour; nothing much happens for the next 20 minutes or so except one of the younger hands, played by man-mountain Abraham Benrubi, heads back to the nearest town for some supplies. When he hasn't returned a couple of days later the two older men find him in jail, nearly beaten to death.</p>
<p>This is just a warning from Gambon, an Irishman who controls the largest ranch as well as the sheriff and town--you can pretty much picture one of those thin mustache twirlers from the silent picture days and nail this character. Duval immediately understands that his boys better destroy Gambon or leave their herd behind and run away, there won't be any middle ground.</p>
<p>But neither of them are willing to duck the fight. Costner's Charley Waite was apparently the Civil War equivalent of a Special Forces soldier though as director he feels no need to specify in which army. Though that might have been 17 years in the past, the stress and skills have lingered--Costner almost seems to making a Vietnam allegory or perhaps a Sopranos western. If there's a difference, the latter probably uses dark humor to emphasize the hollow core of its characters but <span style="font-style:italic;">Open Range</span> is simply gritty and single-minded.</p>
<p>Is this a good film? Compared to other recent westerns like Eastwood's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105695/">Unforgiven</a> or Costner's own <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099348/">Dances with Wolves</a>, I'd say no. While those two films twist a classic genre into modern psychological expeditions and emphasize the beauty of what we gave up for today's conveniences, <span style="font-style:italic;">Open Range</span> exploits those conventions and wastes many minutes of screen time in plodding conversations or extended shots of (admittedly) beautiful vistas. The last hour was actually decent and if someone had stepped in to put Costner right this could have been much better.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">not recommended</span></p>
