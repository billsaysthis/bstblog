<p>Someone should explain to the illustrious list of founders at <a href="http://meta.popdex.com/">Metapop : a collaborative weblog</a> that they should have just joined MetaFilter. Which they obviously knew about, since there using the FreeFilter software clone and have the word Meta in the site's name. Dan gillmor, who talks a good game, falls down on the details as usual and gives this site <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/000982.shtml">linklove</a> without mentioning the original. Ego, what terrible curse on us all.</p>
