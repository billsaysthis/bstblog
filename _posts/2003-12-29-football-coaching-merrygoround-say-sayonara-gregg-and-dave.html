<p>A busy day for the disposal gremlins as Gregg Williams and Dave McGinnis join Jauron looking in from the other side of the window. Williams, for who knows what reason, turned down a contract extension after last season and made it very easy for GM Tom Donohoe to <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=1695981">not offer a renewal</a>; presumably this means that the infamous Kevin Gilbride will also be emptying his office. Down where everybody sweats 24/7, the entire coaching staff is <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=1695989">looking for a new drinking fountain</a> as McGinnis compiled a "Look Ma, no hands!" 17-40 record in 3.5 years. Booya, indeed.</p>
<p><em>Minor update:</em> Dave Wannstedt got a two year extension, one year longer than mentioned in the previous post.</p>
