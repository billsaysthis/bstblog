<p>Nicholas Cage and Sam Rockwell are con artists--<a href="http://matchstickmenmovie.warnerbros.com/">Matchstick Men</a> being a little-used alternative name for the profession--and all of a sudden Cage hooks up with the 14 year old daughter (Allison Lohman) he knew was a possibility but had never met. He struggles with his Dadness. He tries to get better with the help of a psychiatrist. Cage and Rockwell try to pull a big con on Bruce McGill but the ending has a twist or two. Or three.</p>
<p>Ridley Scott is much better known <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0000631/#director">for directing</a> bigger, more active movies like <em>Black Hawk Down</em>, <em>Gladiator</em>, and <em>Alien</em>. Though he did do fairly well with the lighter <em>Thelma and Louis</em>, got to give him that. But while there are some funny and some touching moments in <em>Matchstick Men</em>, almost all between Cage and Lohman, there was just too much confusion over whether this is about a father finding his daughter or a con man learning he no longer has the heart for the con.</p>
<p><em>Somewhat recommended</em></p>
