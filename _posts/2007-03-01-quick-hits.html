<p>I had a very interesting lunch today, and was sitting about 20-25 from a Valley billionaire. Though I didn't have the chance to speak with him.</p>
<p>Arsenal goes down again! Came home from that to watch the Blackburn-Arsenal fourth round FA up replay and saw Benny McCarthy's brilliant late goal to give Wenger's Wangers their third straight defeat. Now, Mark Hughes, please take your South African striker out of the doghouse and put him back in the starting side.</p>
<p>BBC America had another great political thriller last week, a 7.7 hour/three parter called <a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/193/index.jsp">The State Within</a>. Jason Isaacs is the big name in the cast but there are plenty of good performances, including Ben Daniels, Lennie James, Eva Birthistle and Sharon Gless as the US Secretary of Defense with two foot thick armor. The show was written by Lizzie Mickery and Daniel Percival, who penned 2004's also very good and disturbing <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/dirty_war/default.stm"><span style="color:#000000;">Dirty War</span></a>. If you get the chance, definitely watch.</p>
<p>The BeebAmerica premieres a new Robin Hood series Saturday night, looks like it could be decent though I do wonder how it will differ from the gazillion previous filmed versions of the tale.</p>
<p>Star Trek XI will be out for Christmas next year, directed by JJ Abrams and co-written by two of his crew (who also did <span style="font-style:italic;">Mission: Impossible III</span> with him last year). The story will feature Kirk, Spock and Bones during their Starfleet Academy years, possibly a reboot of the mythology as Abrams has said he will honor but not be held hostage to the past.</p>
<p>I have both Akismet and Bad Behavior installed on a couple of WordPress blogs here and the spammers are getting the upper hand lately, if my experience is common, with several recent fake trackbacks evading both plugins. Five new messages have been posted to your blog emails have come in while I wrote this brief post, all spam, all from the same IP address.</p>
