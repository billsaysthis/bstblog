<p>Damn! I'm just finishing up my third day of working for <a href="http://www.evhead.com">Ev</a> and the <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Pyra</a> crew handling some customer service issue and let me say I had pretty much completely forgotten how much of a PITA work actually is. And I get to work from home for this job. Then again, I powered through over 500 emails in the Pyra Inbox and hopefully helped a bunch of my fellow Bloggers. Tomorrow I attack the <a href="http://publicminid.blogger.com">help system</a>! Woohoo!</p>
