<p>The Farce in Florida continues unabated, as Mark Kreidler points out in <a href="http://espn.go.com/columns/kreidler/1331226.html">Bucs are making Notre Dame look good</a>. Not to mention that Oregon coach Mike Bellotti is letting people know quietly that he "is very happy, though, with his current situation." In other words, don't bother calling. And he's getting this message out in response to <em>rumours</em> that the team may call him.</p>
<p>Glazer Brothers, I just want to let you know that I am interested in being hired as general manager of the Buccaneers, as I read that your are about to come to a parting of the ways with Rich McKay. Although I don't have any direct experience, and my dad wasn't one of the greatest football coaches of all time, I have been a huge football fan since childhood and I am smart and learn fast. Also, I will work for a lot less than $1.8 million a year, how does $500,000 sound? Plus relocation expenses, of course, and since I have to move across the country, let's make it a five year deal. One thing, I have these stomach issues so I need a semi-private bathroom to use at all games, home and away. That won't be a deal breaker, will it?</p>
<p>I'm sure I can have the respect of the other teams fairly quickly after I hire a head coach. Well, I think they will at least stop laughing every time the team is mentioned. I can't say <a href="http://www.nfl.com/qbclub/elway_011003.html">who</a> just yet, that's part of what I bring to the table, but let's just say <a href="http://espn.go.com/abcsports/mnf/columns/fouts_dan/index.html">the guy</a> knows <a href="http://www.nfl.com/qbclub/simms.html">offense</a> and is willing to have a strong DCon at his side. But mainly you should hire me because I am willing to take the heat for any decision you want to make. In other words, I am gonna be a great figurehead for you. Let's take a meeting!</p>
