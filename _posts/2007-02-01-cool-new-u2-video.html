<p>Hey, I'm still hep! LOL, sometimes it doesn't feel that way, especially when I hear recent music that's popular with "the kids" and my reaction is along the lines of "You've got to be kidding." Bear that in mind as I tell you that U2, who have been challenging The Boss as producing my favorite music of the last 10 years or so, have just released an awesome video (actually two) for <span style="font-style:italic;">Window in the Skies</span>, one of the two previously unreleased tracks on their <a href="http://www.u2.com/music/index.php?album_id=79&amp;type=lp">U218 Singles</a> hits package.</p>
<p>Direct from YouTube is an <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkxNjcmZmdiZWw3Zjd2cWVlRUV5eTcwNjg0NTImeXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3">incredible job</a> of editing together a few seconds each from 137 clips of other performers on stage, either naturally or via software magic with singing, guitar or drum playing or dancing fit precisely to what's happening in the song as you see it on screen.</p>
<p>There are far too many performers for me to list them all but you'll see The Beatles, The Stones, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley and Elvis Costello, Bob Marley, Nirvana, Lou Reed, Smokey Robinson, The Clash, Beyonce and Ray Charles. No Bruce, though, apparently the rights couldn't be cleared in time, and have no doubt that clearing all the rights was perhaps even more work than the editing.</p>
<p>The second video "offers a dizzying kaleidoscope of imagery from the story of U2 themselves â€“ everything from family photos to iconic album sleeves." Dizzying indeed! You can <a href="http://www.u2.com/highlights/?hid=333">see it on the band's website</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
