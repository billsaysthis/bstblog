<p><b>Kdb: Time for a new SQL?</b>
<p>Relational databases are over 20 years old--think back to IBM's System R in the late '70s--and even SQL92, the most commonly used and supported version of the standard, is closing in on 10. But volumes of data are growing at an ever-increasing volume and Kx Systems thinks it has an answer, particularly for data mining operations. InfoWorld's James Borck takes a look at <a href="http://www.kx.com/">Kdb</a> in <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/op/xml/01/04/09/010409opborck.xml">Database optimization techniques in Kdb could help ease the enterprise data crunch</a>. Kdb is free to download and evaluate, but I couldn't find a mention of pricing for production use on the Kx website.</p>
