<p>FoxsportsWorld probably has their biases but props anyway to the San Jose Earthquakes for placing at 30 in the latest <a href="http://www.foxsportsworld.com/content/view?contentId=921562">FSW world club rankings</a>. Boca Juniors, based on last Sunday's World Club Cup win over AC Milan, took the top spot ahead of all the sky-high salaried European sides.</p>
<p>Belated props to Frank Yallop, the coach who turned around a basement dwelling San Jose squad and led them to two MLS Cups in three years, as he was named head coach of the Canadian National Team this week. He will be missed in these parts but one can hardly quibble over the man's desire to lead his native team and he'll get some quality play from two of our top players, goalkeeper Pat Cannon and striker Dwayne Derosario. While I don't see the Canadians overtaking the 11th ranked Americans, Yallop's addition all of a sudden has his new team favored to at least capture the (new) fourth CONCACAAF slot in the 2006 World Cup.</p>
<p>Leading candidate, at least publicly, to take over the Earthquakes is current assistant Dominic Kinnear. Whoever is on the sideline next season has an excellent chance to defend our title since their should be far fewer games missed by starters called up to national team service. Plus one can only hope that there will be fewer injuries like the one that caused starting striker Brian Ching to miss nearly the entire season. But will it be Landon's last year wearing the blue shirt before heading off to Europe? How many of his teammates will be <a href="http://www.foxsportsworld.com/content/view?contentId=1968410">making the same jump</a> if the team does well again?</p>
