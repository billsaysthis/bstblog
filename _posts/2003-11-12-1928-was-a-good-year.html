<p>The flappers were dancing, the party was shaking, and <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=mom70&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=dad_bdancer2_mom70_98.jpg">my Dad</a> was born. Seventy five years ago today, Richard Leon came into this life in Brooklyn, NY and his greatest achievement (me, sorry Jo) is happy to have had his love and guidance for a lifetime. Happy birthday, Dad, and I look forward to sharing many more with you!</p>
