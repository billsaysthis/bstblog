<p><b>Humor today: Useful computer features and a Pythonesque routine</b>
<p>Someone spent a reasonable amount of time making images of these <a href="http://rita.thegourmet.com/computers.html">Computer Features</a> and they are hilarious (IMO, YMMV). Particularly the Word Tools menu and Copy dialog!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.robotwisdom.com">Robot Wisdom</a> led me to this bit of Monty Pythonesque humor, the hilarious <a href="http://www.sdsc.edu/projects/Xtal/IUCr/CC/School96/Sketch.htm">Two Crystallographers from Yorkshire Sketch</a> "by Anthony Nicholls and Phil Bourne (neither of whom are from Yorkshire, but one of whom spent two years in the People's Republic of South Yorkshire) and with apologies to Monty Python and George Sheldrick (who is from Yorkshire)."</p>
