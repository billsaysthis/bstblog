<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3096776.stm">Scientists determined</a> that a black hole is putting out a B flat sound but because the sound is 57 octaves below Middle C, humans will of course never hear it. Probably would blow out your stereo speakers anyway. Plus the black hole is 250 million light years away, only adding to the difficulty.</p>
<p>A bit easier to hear, not to mention more enjoyable by many orders of magnitude, will be Simon &amp; Garfunkle (not Garfunckle as I originally spelled Art's name) as the duo has <a href="http://asia.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=entertainmentNews&amp;storyID=3415435">finally announced</a> a reunion tour. They'll play the HP Pavillion in San Jose on Nov. 5 but given the price of tickets (up to $200 per seat!) and all, I don't think we'll be going. Bobby Slayton Oct. 11 at the San Jose Improv for $20 a ticket, that's another story entirely. not to mention a completely different kind of sound than the black hole or S&amp;G.</p>
