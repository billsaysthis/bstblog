<p>I realize that the people consumers deal with at big companies on customer services and sales issues are just handing out replies written for them and generally have no ability to influence the answer. Still, I have a hard time reconciling the cognitive dissonence in the email I received today from Comcast in response to my question about how to add Gol TV to my subscription. Apparently, despite the ridiculous amount I already spend to get a package that already includes most of these channels, I can only get Gol TV by purchasing a $4.95 per month 10 channel sports set. Asking why--foolish, I realize--I couldn't just get the one channel, Comcast's answer was:<br />
<blockquote>"Sometimes certain stations are only available within certain packages.</p>
<p>At Comcast, the customer is and always will be the most important part of<br />our business!</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Comcast.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />Your Comcast Customer Care Specialist"</p></blockquote>
<p>Now you tell me, but doesn't sentence two directly contradict sentence one? Ugggh!!! <a href="http://www.phillyfuture.org/">Karl</a>, <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/">you</a> need to talk some sense into your colleagues!</p>
