<p>As if there wasn't enough to worry about these days, we have further agita thanks to voters yesterday who returned control of the Senate to the Republicans. Specific to California, Ah-nuld was able to use his name recognition and political ambitions to foist a <a href="http://joinarnold.com">foolish initiative</a> on us. Lautenberg was able to save the New Jersey seat but Mondale couldn't hold on to Wellstone's and Jean Carnahan proved she wasn't her late husband. A Kennedy lost a safe Democratic seat in the Maryland governor's race. In the realm of Pyrrhic victories, Gray Davis won re-election as governor of our fair state.</p>
<p>I need some breakfast.</p>
