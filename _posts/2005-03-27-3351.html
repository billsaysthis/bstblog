<p><a href="http://jade.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/feed/">Feed to JavaScript?</a>: In case you were wondering about the list of items on the right side of the main page here under the title <strong>ElseSaid</strong>, it's a list of the 10 most recent pages on other sites where I've posted a comment (or possibly trackback) and then tagged the page with del.icio.us. An amusing experiment in republishing RSS feeds, basically, along with the newser <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/news/soccer_news.phtml">pages</a> I cobbled <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/news/health_news.phtml">together</a> last weekend. Newser and Feeds2JS are both built on top of the most excellent PHP library <a href="http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/">MagpieRSS</a>. Do you like my made up word ElseSaid?</p>
