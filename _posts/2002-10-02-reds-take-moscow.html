<p>No, I'm not reprinting headlines from 1917! Just reporting on the <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/championsleague/2002/20021002/reports/63850_full.html">glorious 5-0 victory</a> by Liverpool FC today at home against Spartak Moscow in their third match of the current season of Champions League play. Vastly better than last week's 1-1 draw with Basel.</p>
<p>Since ESPN2 has the US broadcast rights to Champions League matches and is currently only braodcasting one match per week (Tuesdays, 11:30 a.m. PST), this game was once again not shown. However, the reports indicate that the Russian side simply could not keep up with LFC's speed even though Emile Heskey started up front and not Milan Baros; didn't hurt that Heskey scored two goals. Bruno Cheyrou took Heskey's previous space in midfield and also contributed a goal and John Arne Riise remained at left back though Jimmy Traore did come on as a substitute for the recovered Stephen Henchoz at the hour mark.</p>
<p>Excellent result for a home match and, combined with <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/championsleague/2002/20021002/reports/63851_full.html">Valencia's 6-2 drubbing of Basel</a> moves the Reds into second in their group at the halfway point of the first round.</p>
<p>Next for the boys is a tough Sunday Premiership meeting with Chelsea at Anfield.</p>
