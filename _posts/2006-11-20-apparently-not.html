<p>A few days ago I asked "<a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2006_11_12_blog_archive.phtml#116362154398127551">Are Americans really this sick?</a>" after finding out that Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. planned to publish a book by O.J. Simpson title <span style="font-style:italic;">If I Did It</span> through its HarperCollins unit and air a two part primetime TV interview with the murderer on its Fox network.</p>
<p>Happily, I <a href="http://blogs.kansascity.com/tvbarn/2006/11/nevermind_oj_cr.html">read this afternoon</a> that the backlash against these inexplicable products has worked, that greed-driven appeals to the most base instincts don't always succeed. "I and senior management agree with the American public that this was an ill-considered project," <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=entertainmentNews&amp;storyID=2006-11-20T210101Z_01_N14435424_RTRUKOC_0_US-SIMPSON.xml">Murdoch said today</a>.</p>
<p>Then again, perhaps the company was simply acknowledging reality as more than a dozen affiliates decided not to air the shows, one of the major chains agreed to donate any profits to a relevant charity and even its own star staffers announced their disgust along with plans to boycott any advertisers.</p>
