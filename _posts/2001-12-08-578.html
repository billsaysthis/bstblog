<p><strong>LotR teaser: Liv Tyler, Christopher Tolkien</strong></p>
<p>Tell me that <a href="http://us.ent4.yimg.com/movies.yahoo.com/images/hv/photo/movie_pix/new_line_cinema/the_lord_of_the_rings__the_fellowship_of_the_ring/liv_tyler/rings.jpg">Liv Tyler</a> isn't gorgeous in this shot as Arwen. On the other hand, JRR Tolien's son Christopher<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml?type=entertainmentnews&amp;StoryID=439112">says</a> dad would not have approved of the films. "My own position is that 'The Lord Of The Rings' is peculiarly unsuitable to transformation into visual dramatic form," he said. Screw that, I've seen the trailer and I can't wait!</p>
