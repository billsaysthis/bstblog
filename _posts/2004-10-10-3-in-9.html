<p>As in, the Earthquakes have scored three goals in their last nine games. The only saving grace has been a defense almost as good as the offense has been bad, with four clean sheets in that run, giving the team a 1-4-4 record. Plus Dallas has been even worse so San Jose has a two point lead on them for the fourth and last Western playoff spot with the Burn needing a victory next Saturday night to leap over us.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Aside:</span> Real Salt Lake? There's a huge Spanish market in Utah. Or not. I'm still puzzled over Salt Lake City getting the expansion franchise over A-League standouts Seattle and Rochester.<br /></p>
