<p><strong>Football coaching merrygoround: Tampa Bay sucking wind</strong></p>
<p>So sure, Parcells was all set to take over the Bucs, he was even accused of tampering with some other teams' assistant coaches, but The Tuna blew the Bucs off so he could enter the Hall of Fame. EPSN's Len Pasquarelli says the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/columns/pasquarelli_len/1313773.html">choices are limited for Tampa Bay</a> and he reviews what is for the most part a bunch of washed up white guys. Okay, Denny Green is a washed up black guy, better he should go fishing and <a href="http://espn.go.com/rpm/wc/2002/0119/1314222.html">run a NASCAR team</a> next year than coach.</p>
<p>To me, the only interesting name on the list is St. Louis defensive coordinator <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/columns.nsf/Jeff%20Gordon/7A0524CA28A4EC6686256B20000E5618/story?opendocument">Lovie Smith</a>. He did a great job with the Rams' D this year and could end up being the key to a second Super Bowl win there in two weeks and is only one year away from being the Buc's linebacker coach.</p>
<p>Pasquarelli also has a good column on why <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs01/columns/pasquarelli_len/1313478.html">John Fox</a> will be the next Carolina coach. Fox is currently the Giants' defensive coordinator (do we see a theme here?) and defense wasn't the reason the Giants missed the playoffs a year after their amazing run to the Super Bowl. Fox deserves a shot but this could be another case of friend hiring friend too.</p>
