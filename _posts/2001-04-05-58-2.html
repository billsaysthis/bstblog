<p><b>Just because you can doesn't mean you should</b>
<p>Apparently, Geoffrey Osowski and Wilson Tang didn't pay attention to the recent Citibank commercials and will have to pay the price after <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1004-200-5514185.html?tag=mn_hd">being indicted</a> for transferring stock of Cisco, their employer, into their own accounts to the tune of over $6.3 million. Gee, people won't be suspicious when the stockprice is tanking an you show up at work wearing a $44,000 diamond ring and driving a $52,000 Mercedes.</p>
