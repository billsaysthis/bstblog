<p>Reading <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/09/opinion/09SAFI.html">Safire in the Times today</a>, I saw a link to "<a href="http://www.edwardjayepstein.com">www.edwardjayepstein.com</a>, the Web site of my unfazed Angletonian friend." An actual live link, which is most unusual for the NY Times, so I clicked through. Epstein's site, although marked still under heavy construction, has quite a lot of interesting material. The man has been an investigative reporter since (at least) the mid '60s who focuses often on the Intelligence community.</p>
<p>There is much material on the events of last Sep. 11, information and questions that need answers. A collection of what Epstein terms fictoids, bits of information that have somehow come to be taken for the truth even though there really is none. For example, lie detectors. Everyone "knows" that they are imperfect machines, otherwise the results would be accepted in court, but the reality is that lie detectors measure nothing in a meaningful, scientific sense. "There are still no peer- reviewed test using randomly distributed true and false answers." Many other topics touched on and whole books by the author are posted. The site is even interactive, with contests, questions, and an Ask Ed feature.</p>
<p>Check it out but set aside a couple of hours for interesting exploration. Lots of material for the warblogging crowd which, except for one brief mention on Instapundit, doesn't seem to have picked up on him.</p>
