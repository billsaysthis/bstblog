<p><b>Thomas Friedman on the start of WWIII</b></p>
<p>Writing an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/13/opinion/13FRIE.htm">op-ed piece</a> in the NY Times, Thomas Friedman gives us an understanding of what may be ahead in a serious campaign against terrorists. Friedman has spent much of the last decade developing an understanding of the effects of economic and political globalization, much of which was published in the highly recommended (by me) <a href="http://www.lexusandtheolivetree.com/">The Lexus and the Olive Tree</a>, and is a very credible voice; this piece was written in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Friedman makes the point, which many others have as well, that these groups are incredibly difficult to infiltrate and track; this is largely possible only when local associates/rivals are willing to help. This is a factor in our government's inability--not failure--to predict and prevent the attack.</p>
<p>Key quote:</p>
<p>"The people who planned Tuesday's bombings combined world-class evil with world-class genius to devastating effect. And unless we are ready to put our best minds to work combating them--the World War III Manhattan project--in an equally daring, unconventional and unremitting fashion, we're in trouble. Because while this may have been the first major battle of World War III, it may be the last one that involves only conventional, non-nuclear weapons."</p>
