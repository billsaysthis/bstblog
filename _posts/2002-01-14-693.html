<p><strong>Imagination takes many forms</strong></p>
<p>Back in 1978, <a href="http://www.david-drake.com/bibliography.html">David Drake published</a> the novel Hammer's Slammers, a story of a future mercenary unit that travelled from star to star fighting the good fight for a paycheck. Drake followed that one up with about seven more Slammer books and another one should be out in July. Like <a href="http://www.starwars.com">many</a> a <a href="http://www.startrek.com">science fiction</a> series, the Slammers have inspired a <a href="http://www.salute.co.uk/slammers3/index.htm">fan following of their own</a>. These fans, part of a very popular UK hobby, create and paint miniatures of the regiment's vehicles and other equipment, as well as those of competing regiments, and this website has great photos, information, and instructions for building your own. What do they do with the miniatures after they've spent so much time in construction? They fight them against each other according to very strict rules, which are also posted on the website. And they get all this from some very cool books.</p>
