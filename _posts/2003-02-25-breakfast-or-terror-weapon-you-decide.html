<p>OMG! I don't know which is funnier, <a href="http://www.x-entertainment.com/articles/0744/index.html">this article</a> or the "<a href="http://www.swansonmeals.com/" title="Hungry Man All Day Breakfast">meal</a>" it is about! Don't read the article immediately before or after you plan on eating. And by immediately I mean, oh, 24 hours. And, as one of the <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user.mefi/3313">commentators</a> in the <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/23859">MetaFilter thread</a> put it: "It's probably even worse than pictured - most of those big hungry men put butter on their pancakes ..." If there was such a thing, this product would be instantly entered into the Anti-Atkins Hall of Fame, no five year waiting period necessary.</p>
