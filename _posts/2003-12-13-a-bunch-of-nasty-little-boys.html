<p>Even the FCC has taken notice of the <a href="http://www.southparkstudios.com/show/guide.html?season=5" title="Episode 502">South Park Shit episode</a>, in which the bad boys of animation go postal on the commission's decision over when curse words are acceptable on TV, but this is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A61109-2003Dec12?language=printer">only brought to light</a> when rich ditz Nicole Richie lets her potty mouth flow on the recent Billboard Music Awards broadcast. <em>"Have you ever tried to get cow [expletive] out of a Prada purse?" Richie said. "It's not so [expletive] simple."</em> But apparently Fox wasn't fast (or concerned) enough to bleep out all the expletives when it was shown live to the East Coast audience. I have to admit to a certain level of distate for such language on television even though I'm quick enough to use the same vocabulary in conversation.</p>
