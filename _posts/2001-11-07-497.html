<p><b>Calculate your layoff probability</b></p>
<p>The nice folks have developed the <a href="http://www.dismal.com/dismal/dsp/tools/calculator/layoff.asp">Dismal Scientist Layoff Calculator</a> as a public service. Simply plug in your zip code, industry, occupation, last job review grade, and, if applicable, employer's stock symbol and out will pop a percentage. For example, if you live in Pacifica, work as a programmer for Sun Microsystems, and received a middle third rating, your probability is 8.8%. Not bad. I think this is one of those unintentionally funny things in life.</p>
