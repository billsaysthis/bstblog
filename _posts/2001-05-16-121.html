<p><b>Warning: Scientists find new ways to kill us all</b><br />

<p>Now you know I'm not a science basher, far from it, but I will say that these guys are finding ways to kill more and more of us faster than ever if the wrong people get their hands on the wrong stuff. The latest: <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/0105/17/world/world3.html">Mutant bacteria biowars threaten apocalypse now</a>. That is, using easily available tech, someone can make subtle genetic alterations to, say, smallpox that makes it thousands of times more resistant to treatment. Would even the most vicious, hardened terrorist want to release this? Probably not since the people they are fighting for would be just as much at risk. However, a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/">nut job</a> with a little money and brains might be willing to.</p>
