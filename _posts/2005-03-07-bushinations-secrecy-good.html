<p>This is a republic, with an emphasis on an informed polity, so why do Bush's executive orders allowing rendition <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&amp;sid=adMPQU5bnQXs&amp;refer=us">need to be classified</a>? Not the details of any specific individual tranferred to another nation under it, which is a different discussion, but the order itself. My guess is that the verbiage would be embarassing, at the least, to the Administration and in any case this fits precisely with their historical behavior of hiding everything possible from the public.</p>
