<p><b>Once again, porn is driving new technology</b><br />

<p>Remember the first VCRs? What types of tapes were most likely to be found playing in them? <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Movies_and_Film/Genres/Adult_Movies/">Porn</a>. For what type of Internet content are the most people will to pay? If you said <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Shopping_and_Services/Sex/Online_Clubs_and_Galleries/">porn again</a>, you'd be correct. So is it surprising that with the <a href="https://store.palm.com/Catalog/productdetails.asp?productnr=3C80801U&amp;parent=1004" title="From Palm">most recent generation</a> of <a href="http://athome.compaq.com/showroom/static/iPaq/handheld.asp" title="From Compaq">PDAs</a>, devices that support video on color screens, porn is once again pioneering the economic model? The LA Times reports all this and more in <a href="http://www.latimes.com/technology/columnists/techcol/la-000058970jul19.story?coll=la-business-technology_column">Private Screening in Public Places</a>. Me? I never look at the stuff!</p>
