<p>This morning I had to stop at the bank and take out a loan so I could fill up the car's gas tank (ba da boom).</p>
<p>Can you understand how the Italian police could not catch the top man in the Sicilian mafia for 40 years, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4898930.stm">until yesterday</a>? No matter how careful Provenzano was, he was still running the biggest criminal gang in the country, actively, for the last dozen years and had to communicate and keep in touch somehow.</p>
<p>There is much unhappiness in the ex-Sun camp, exemplified by former VP John Shoemaker's <a href="http://marketwatch-cnet.com.com/Ex-Sun+exec+lambasts+Sun%2527s+late+layoffs/2100-1014_3-6059491.html?type=pt&amp;part=marketwatch-cnet&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=news">blast at the company</a>. I certainly agree that the board should have done whatever was necessary to keep Ed Zander and his results since taking over Motorola are good evidence. I spoke with Ed a few times when NetDynamics was acquired; he came by to meet the troops, something Scott McNealy did <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> do, and showed a strong understanding of why NetD was good for Sun.</p>
<p>The New York Times has a decent article about how <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/11/business/retirement/11blogs.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">not all blogs are being written by youngsters</a> or even the middle aged such as me though I think the phrase they coined to refer to the group, elderbloggers, is pretty terrible. I wonder if I can get my Dad to start writing because he really knows how to tell a story.</p>
<p>Bush, Bush, Bush. I just would like to have one <del>week</del> day when he and his crew don't get headlines for <a href="http://www.danshafer.com/onemind/?q=node/85">yet another stupid and/or dangerous decision</a>.</p>
<p>John Gruber may, like Robert X Cringely, not always be right--though he is often funny--but reading his occasional essays such as <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/04/asinine_and_or_risky_ideas">today's analysis</a> of why Boot Camp does not presage the availability of OS X for non-Apple hardware nor does it mean that Apple will be competing (any more directly than they already do) with Microsoft. Personally, that the new Intel-based laptops can boot into Windows or run it in a VM layer is giving me thoughts of spending some cash on one this summer, after the second wave of machines are released.</p>
