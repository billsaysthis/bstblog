<ul>
<li>Lebron James, the likely first pick in the NBA draft,  was interviewed at halftime of tonight's Spurs-Mavs game and showed up dressed head to toe in Nike gear. Even a logo'ed headband to make sure his sponsor is onscreen every second he is. Guess giving an 18 year old a $90 million, seven year contract means getting value from Day One.</p>
</li>
<li>Russell Beattie makes an <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/20030525.html#165701">excellent speculation</a> on a future hotspot for corporate developers.
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pamslife.com/">Pam</a>, playing with her guitar-playing partner Tim as The Secrets, rocked the Palo Alto Farmers Market yesterday, with both Dar and Lucinda Williams covers plus Fleetwood Mac and more. The little girls were dancing to her tunes.
</li>
<li>Were you as surprised as me by <a href="http://www.brucealmighty.com/">Bruce Almighty</a> rocking the box office this weekend? <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2003&amp;wknd=21&amp;p=.htm">To the tune</a> of $70M!
</li>
<li>Slightly Bent, otherwise known as Ron Green, <a href="http://www.slightlybent.com/200305archive001.asp#1053867954001">poses an interesting question</a>: Where are the leaks and rumors about the next version of IE?
</li>
<li>Market researchers Gartner, probably figuring that few clients will pay their ridiculous fees when Linux truly dominates the landscape, <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/05/26/1053801324836.html">tries to power up</a> their pro-SCO stance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry about the ungainly appearance of these bullet list postings but I refuse to fuss/workaround Blogger's longtime weakness any more.</p>
