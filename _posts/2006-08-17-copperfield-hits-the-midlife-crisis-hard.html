<p>SCI FI Wire is reporting that magician David Copperfield will turn 50 next month and has <a href="http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=7&amp;id=37525">announced the discovery of the Fountain of Youth</a>. The real one, that Ponce de Leon and others <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_of_Youth">searched for</a>, on one of the islands he bought in the Caribbean recently. I know losing a hottie like Claudia Schiffer can be a terrible blow to your ego, Dave, and I'm no stranger to the horrors of realizing one will not, actually, live forever.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">"I've discovered a true phenomenon," Copperfield told Reuters in a telephone interview. "You can take dead leaves, they come in contact with the water, they become full of life again. ... Bugs or insects that are near death, come in contact with the water, they'll fly away. It's an amazing thing, very, very exciting."</span></p>
<p>Seriously, I hope this is just a publicity stunt for an upcoming TV special. But then I checked Google News and the story is being reported <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ncl=http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,19777,00.html">far and wide</a>. In which case I hope Copperfield has invested wisely because this <a href="http://www.redsbasement.wnymedia.net/?p=207">might be the end of his performing career</a>, though you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_hilton">never can tell</a> with the American public <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Behind_%28series%29">these days</a>.</p>
