<p><b>The right not to be a parent</b><br />

<p>The New Jersey Supreme Court, in a ruling today, granted a women the right to <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010814/ts/rights_embryos_dc_2.html">dispose of frozen embryos</a> that were prepared while she was still married to the man whose sperm is involved. The man involved is a devout Roman Catholic and such a disposition violates his religious beliefs. What I really find most intriguing about the court's decision is that "the fundamental right of [the woman] not to procreate outweighs [the man's] right to procreate." What if the situation were a little different: a couple separate, the woman finds out she is pregnant, and the man does not want to be a father? Can he go to court and force the woman, citing this precedent, to have an abortion? After all, to again quote the ruling, "the woman [would presumably be] capable of having other children, [her] right to procreate is not lost if [she] is denied the opportunity...; whereas if the [baby is bought to term, the man] will be forced to become a biological parent." Is this another <a href="http://www.unt.edu/lpbr/subpages/reviews/rudenst.htm">slippery slope</a>?</p>
