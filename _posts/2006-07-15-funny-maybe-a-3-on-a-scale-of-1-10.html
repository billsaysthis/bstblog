<p>I'm pretty sure <a href="http://www.supportmycircle.com/">My Circle On Trial</a> is the kind of fake character blog <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/07/02/your-exit-interview-of-me-2/">Scoble</a> et al have been calling out lately. I found it via a blog ad on <a href="http://talkleft.com/new_archives/015328.html">LVPD Shocked by Murder of Officer and Its Own Inexperience</a>, a fairly serious article about the on the ground effect of Scalia's decision about police and exclusion of illegally taken evidence.</p>
<p>Since there are more anti-corporate class action lawsuits these days than you can shake a stick at, I had to read quite a bit of Claudia Lake's reporting on this so-called "Trial of the Century" before realizing the site is a joke. Call me funnybone-deficient or thick as a brick for not recognizing the intent immediately if you like but the whole thing in no way makes me more likely to switch to Alltel, the cellphone company behind it.</p>
<p>If anything, I agree more with Robert and <a href="http://www.micropersuasion.com/2005/04/character_blogs.html">Steve Rubel</a> that such sites are wasted energy that can be much more productively used to <a href="http://listics.com/20060715380">directly engage customers and potential customers</a>.</p>
