<p><strong>Price Harry smokes pot, do we care?</strong></p>
<p>Celebrities often say that the biggest downside to such status is the fishbowl within which they are fored to live. For the English royal family, that intense spotlight appears to be even worse. This morning, for example, papers all over are running some variants of Reuter's story: <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml;jsessionid=1MZSIXIKLQCVOCRBAE0CFFAKEEATGIWD?type=entertainmentnews&amp;StoryID=511825">Prince's Drinking, Drug Use Give Press a Field Day</a>. Similarly, the (unlinkable) SJ Mercury News ran a story in today's paper discussing the difficulties SJ Mayor Ron Gonzalez is having settling the spousal support amount with his former wife, down to the details of amount sought by each and monthly spending habits.</p>
<p>My question to you all is do you really care? Do you want to read about some 17 year old's experimenting with getting high? About the dispute of a few dollars between two relatively unimportant people? Is that how you get your thrills? Would you seek celebrity or notoriety and willingly subject yourself to the spotlight?</p>
