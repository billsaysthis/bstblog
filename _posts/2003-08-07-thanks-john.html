<p>Mr. Robb had <a href="http://jrobb.mindplex.org/2003/08/07.html#a3487">an interesting idea</a> this morning, for which I thank him, and I'm <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/brucenews/bsnmain.phtml">experimenting</a> with it now. Of course since I just did this 15 minutes ago there is nothing much to see just yet.</p>
