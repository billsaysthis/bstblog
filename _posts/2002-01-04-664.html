<p><strong>Coaching wheel keeps turning</strong></p>
<p>Notre Dame started things off, really, by firing Bob Davies, goofing with The Liar, then stealing Tyrone Willingham away from Stanford. Speculation began mounting about Denny Green in Minnesota and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2002/0104/1305597.html">now he's out</a>. Then, after a fabulous win over Maryland Wednesday night, Steve Spurrier <a href="http://espn.go.com/ncf/news/2002/0104/1305688.html">resigned as Florida head coach</a> saying he'd done enough at the college level and wants an NFL job. Herbstreit <a href="http://espn.go.com/ncf/columns/herbstreit/1305750.html">speculates</a> that Broncos coach Mike Shanahan migh welcome this change but points out that the new UF coach will face sky high expectations for the 2002 season.</p>
<p>SJ Mercury News (to which I prefer not to link) columnist Skip Bayless speculated this morning that Stanford University and 49ers coach Steve Marriuci would be a great match for each other. I could easily see Spurrier coming in to replace Marriuci except that he's so used to being in total control of the program that he might not accept less than a combined coach/GM job, which isn't going to be available with the Niners.</p>
<p>Other possible NFL changes (the league averages seven head coaching changes a year): George Seifert is looking mighty weary in Carolina and Jim Mora had a bad season in Indy (could his son, 49ers defensive coordinator Jim Mora, replace him?); even the great Tony Dungy needs to do some damage in the post-season to be invited back (note that Spurrier almost left UF in 1995 to take this job). LSU's Nick Saban is mentioned as a possible replacement in Indinapolis but his current bosses want to give him a bigtime extension after winning the SEC and walloping Illinois. Mike Riley was fired by the Chargers Monday and is meeting with college ADs (he came to the NFL after a good stint at Oregon).</p>
