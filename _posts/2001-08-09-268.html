<p><b>Stripping for the news</b><br />

<p>This is surreal! <a href="http://www.nakednews.com/">The Naked News</a> is web newscaster, showing streaming video news reports with 'on-air' talent who strip naked as they read the news. But the read real news! No pole swinging but one newsreader was giving a story on a disgraced African bishop as she pulled off her panties. The site offers some content free but also offers a membership for $9.95 per month. For your money you get full screen video (not just a RealVideo window) and downloadable news clips, though I'm not sure this is worth the cash.</p>
<p>Wired News has a report on <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,45946,00.html">recent talent auditions</a>.</p>
