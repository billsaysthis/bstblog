<p><strong>Like they would tell us</strong></p>
<p>Many people have speculated on where the Bush team will take the War on Terrorism next. Somalia, Yemen, Iraq. But whichever they choose, there is no way that the target would be leaked to a tabloid rag like the NY Post. So of course the Post runs <a href="http://www.nypost.com/news/worldnews/39454.htm">SECRET PLAN TO TOPPLE SADDAM</a> and attributes the story to an unnamed individual and then only claim this person is "reported to have said" it. Gee and people think newspapers are full of crap; articles like this are precisely why!</p>
