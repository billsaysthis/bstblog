<p>The skies are grey outside, I'm down in the dumps, but then something comes along to bring me up. On the last leg of the Morning Coffee Stroll, I see some odd motion off to the left. Looking over, I see a young (maybe late teens/early 20s) guy spinning a young woman around and around in the middle of the side street! He's holding her around the waist and going around and around, they're both smiling. Even when he stops, they are holding hands, putting arms around each other, even smiling as they notice me, 50 feet away, noticing them. I kept walking, didn't want to intrude on their moment of happiness to ask, but I wonder what their good news was--did they just get engaged? As I moved out of sight, the last image was of them in a big passionate kiss. Brought a big ol' smile to my face.</p>
