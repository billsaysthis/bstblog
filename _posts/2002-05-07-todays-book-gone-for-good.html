<p>I could write a lot about Harlan Coben's <a href="http://www.harlancoben.com/novels.shtml">ninth novel</a>. I would say that Harlan has achieved his goal of writing a crisp page turner. That his characters are full and his plot is not even close to predictable. That he knows how to engage the reader's emotions. Since this book, as good as the rest is, depends on plot I wouldn't even try and summarize it here. Trust me, this is worth the price of the hardback.</p>
<p>I wish I could tell you that he won another <a href="http://www.mysterywriters.org/awards/edgars_02_winners.html">Edgar</a> the other night for last year's <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_08_19_blog_archive.phtml#5197562">Tell No One</a> but that novel was only nominated for Best Mystery and didn't win.</p>
