<p>I am impressed. I got a pleasant, positive response from Caroline Chang, KTVU Program Manager, to my complaint about the delay of 24 and Andy Richter Saves the Universe. She said it was pilot error, a mixup between herself and the Master Control staff, and she offered to send a videotape of the show. A good first step, for which I thanked her.</p>
<p>But it isn't really enough. I need KTVU to commit to airing a show like 24 when they say it will start, or there's no point in watching. Unlike almost any other show, 24 demands that you see every episode to understand what's going on. Perhaps this is an extreme attitude but I'll wait and see what Ms. Chang's next response says.</p>
