<p><b>Starfleet seems to think we're ready to begin our mission.</b></p>
<p>So says Captain Jonathon Archer in <a href="http://www.startrek.com/news/nextonent.asp">tonight's premiere episode of Enterprise</a>. Wow, I am so excited, so psyched to see this. Early reports are very, very positive, saying the new series will recharge the energy of the Trek franchise. Look for a report tomorrow!</p>
<p>Another bit of good news: Paramount <a href="http://www.startrek.com/production/startrekx/articles/092401.html">gave the green light</a> to start production on Star Trek: Nemesis, the tenth Star Trek movie; expect it in theaters in about a year. Again, early reports on the script by <a href="http://www.historicalweapons.com/gladiatormovie.html">Gladiator</a> writer and lifelong Trek fan John Logan are very positive, with lots of strong action and characters. Stuart Baird (the very cool Kurt Russell flick <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0116253">Executive Decision</a> and U.S. Marshalls) will be directing and Digital Domain (James Cameron's company, which also handled Lord of the Rings and Titanic) will provide special effects.</p>
