<p><a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com">garret</a> linked articles on <a href="http://www.policyreview.org/AUG02/chollet.html">Rwanda</a> and <a href="http://www.sfnewmexican.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=5342712&amp;BRD=2144&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=367954&amp;rfi=6">Afghanistan</a> today that provoked a similar reaction in me: WTF, is everything everywhere our business (as a nation, not individuals)? Seriously, people elsewhere in the world (Rwanda) kill each other and because the US government didn't speak out or intervene, the mess is our fault?</p>
<p>Same with the Afghans, no one is forcing them to live in a place with such few natural resources and harsh living conditions, or to fight each other. Okay, the Russians did start things up (and we saw some advantage in getting involved in a small way) but that's still not on us.</p>
<p>Sure as individuals we might want to do our best to help our fellow human beings but that doesn't give a nation, even one as powerful as America, the requirement to act. And therefore, cannot be blamed for not acting.</p>
