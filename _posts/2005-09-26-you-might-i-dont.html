<p>I read all the time on the web that Ricky Gervais's BBC series <em>The Office</em> is screamingly funny and great, possibly the best comedy in many a year. Tonight HBO had the premiere of his new show <a href="http://www.hbo.com/extras/">Extras</a> which got good reviews so I tuned in for a trial. Honestly I couldn't make it through an entire episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">Office</span> and only watched all 30 this time because, well, I kept waiting for something better and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Simpsons</span> wasn't on yet.</p>
