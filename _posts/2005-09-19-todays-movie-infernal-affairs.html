<p>A 2002 Hong Kong import, <a href="http://www.infernalaffairs.com/2002/infernalaffairs.html">Infernal Affairs</a> compares and contrasts two young men on twisting intersecting paths. Both members of the same polica academy class, Andy Lau washes out while Tony Leung makes the grade and climbs to a leadership position in the major crimes bureau. In reality, though, Lau is working longterm undercover for Leung's boss while Leung is a mole for crime lord Sam Wong, ostensibly Lau's boss.</p>
<p>After many years both reach positions of sufficient responsibility to cause major damage and must finally confront each other. Direcctors Wai Keung Lau (who is confusing sometimes also billed as Andy Lau but is not the actor starring here) and Siu Fai Mak architect this collision gracefully and I understand why Martin Scorsese, Leonardo Dicaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen and a stellar supporting cast are participating in the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407887/">American remake</a>.</p>
