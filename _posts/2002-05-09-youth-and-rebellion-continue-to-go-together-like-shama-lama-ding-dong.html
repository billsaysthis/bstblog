<p>Steven points out that <a href="http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2002/05/Kidsarethesame.shtml">kids are the same</a> everywhere, protesting US policies in Saudi Arabia wearing American branded clothing or protesting <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/misc/tribe_vs_glob.phtml">globalization</a> in Washington, D.C. wearing clothes made in Asia. Which is a handy lead-in because I was going to point out the same regarding an equally ridiculous yet completely unsurprising protest at Santa Clara University yesterday that I read about in the still unlinkable SJ Mercury news.</p>
<p>SCU is a private, Jesuit-run school here in the South Bay. The school's investment policy forbids owning stock in, among other industries, companies that make weapons. One of the South Bay's larger employers is Lockheed-Martin, one of the largest weapon manufacturers. Lockheed-Martin, which employs many engineers, recently gave the university's engineering school a $50,000 gift. Students marched yesterday demanding the school return the gift and that it synchronize the investment and donation policies. Which leads to the simple but obvious question: How many of SCU's engineering graduates go to work for the defense giant each year?</p>
