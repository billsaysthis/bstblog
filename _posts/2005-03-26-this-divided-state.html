<p>I am still wondering(*) how the person involved found me but in recognition of the effort, here's a shoutout: <a href="http://www.thisdividedstate.com/">This Divided State</a> is a new documentary by <span class="style1"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;">Steven Greenstreet </span></span>about the outroar in Utah when, just before the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_10_31_blog_archive.phtml#109944539802329352">recent election debacle</a>, Utah Valley State College invited Michael Moore to speak on campus. MormonWorld being, of course, a hugely Red state so five months later, state legislators <a href="http://www.netxnews.net/vnews/display.v/ART/2005/02/13/421101cf7b9f6">remain angry enough</a> to punish the school.</p>
<p>* Practically, probably through a Google search on some combination of movie and political words, but the bigger question is the decision process the PR person used to decide it was worth her time to bother with <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/contact.phtml?sub=Crashing%20into%20the%20post-human%20future">my contact form</a> to send a message, even if the message was just copy &amp; paste of a new press release. Which, by the way, isn't even posted on their site so I can't link to it. In short, they've announced a series of screenings on college campuses across the country over the next six weeks, good for them, and the specifics are on the main page but no specific permalink, oh well. Closest for me is Berkeley.</p>
