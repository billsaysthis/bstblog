<p>A check for $53 its in front of me<br />
<br />Replacing the cash I laid out last week<br />
<br />Buying a lamp for a friend at Costco<br />
<br />Since I belong and she does not.</p>
<p>Do you belong? Would you be a better<br />
<br />Person if you did or is this irrelevant, just<br />
<br />Noise and not signal? Certainly I'm glad to<br />
<br />Help out and Do my friend this little favor.</p>
<p>I don't belong to any political party, always registered<br />
<br />As an independent. Even in college I would not<br />
<br />Join a frat because I was GDI. The kind of people with whom<br />
<br />I prefer to spend time would not belong to frats.</p>
<p>Or sororities, since I enjoy time with women as well as or<br />
<br />Even more than men. Though I spend much time these days with<br />
<br />Evan and he does not belong to Costco and did not join a frat<br />
<br />Even though he spent a decade at Uni.</p>
<p>Every time I typed belong in this poem I spelled it<br />
<br />Wrong, or incorrectly, except this last and so at least I<br />
<br />Belong to one useful club--humanity where no one is<br />
<br />Perfect, at least no the last time I looked.</p>
