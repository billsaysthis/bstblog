<p><a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_02_08_blog_archive.phtml#107637080164319170">The saga</a> does not end. I admit, I was a bad boy and sent this response:</p>
<p>"Ooh, I'm so scared! All those capital letters and harsh words." Really, I just don't seem willing to allow my correspondent the final word, which they so seem to desire. OTOH, I see the opportunity to turn annoyance into amusement. Plus, last night the other owners, at least those who bothered to show up or give a proxy, re-elected me to another year in my very prestigious office.</p>
<p>This morning awaiting me in the inbox was an email with the subject "3 rd FINAL WARNING." So apparently the second warning was not the final one for me. I'm thinking this person misunderstands the word final, aren't you? And what did this email say?</p>
<p><em>"JUST STOP IT.</p>
<p>You have demonstrated who you are in your actions and emails.</p>
<p>NO MORE, ENOUGH."</em></p>
<p>Seriously, though, I'm not about to give in that easily. No way. So I quickly composed an answer of my own to keep the ball rolling:</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry you feel this way. Really, I am. Because your feelings are so much more important than mine or anyone else's."</p>
<p>Wonder what tomorrow will bring. Will these warnings be transformed into action? Will I rue my inability to control my funny bone? Stay tuned to this same Bat channel to find out.</p>
