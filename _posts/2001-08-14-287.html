<p><b>We will remember</b><br />

<p>We must remember the millions who died at the hands of the Nazis before and during World War II. <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/">The Nizkor Holocaust Educational Resource</a> has extensive resources to help ensure this continues to be so. Amazingly, there are people who've gone to great lengths to deny this terrible fact; why do the deny it? "The real purpose of holocaust revisionism is to make National Socialism an acceptable political alternative again." And that, for sure, can never be allowed!</p>
