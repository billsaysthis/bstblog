<p>Tomorrow is moving day. We're mostly packed though there is reluctance to uncable the TVs and related equipment and the PCs. One benefit of preparing Casa de Lazar for sale was that we ran through all the closets, drawers and cabinets to see what could be tossed, so that was one chore we didn't need to do and there's less to move. Compared to ten years ago when I moved to the Bay Area this is a lot easier.</p>
<p>Moving also means I'm no longer president of this little HOA. Most people won't volunteer to be on the board but I didn't find it to be particulaly annoying or difficult. The business matters need to be looked after and checks have to be signed or the development would be in a mess. The one big sore spot is the ongoing conflict with Mrs X. The issue is unresolved, sadly, as this person's lawsuit against the board has dragged on and on through several lawyers and amended complaints.</p>
<p>I suppose since the suit is a matter of public record I could name the name but why bother? The case might be resolved by the end of the month though I've thought that before and it didn't happen. We've offered a more reasonable settlement than I was happy with but the other board members convinced me it was the best choice; she's had it in her hands for about a month without responding so maybe there's a curve coming soon. No longer my problem but best wishes to those left behind.</p>
<p>We're staying in Mountain View, renting in a nice apartment complex over near Los Altos and a little bit more convenient to both of our offices and the gym. When the bubble bursts, we'll look to get back into homeownership.</p>
