<p>Is the world a safer place? Nope. But no matter. Beau over at DentedReality in Australia posted PHP code to call the Blogger API and I decided to play around with it a little. After looking his fine effort over, I decided it needed the billsaysthis touch and converted it into <a href="http://www.dentedreality.com.au/bloggerapi/">a fine OOP PHP class</a>. Don't know what that means? Don't worry. Just check out the result on <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/entertain/rating_bruce.phtml">my Springsteen page</a>; I use it to pull in all the Springsteen weblog entries. And you can use it too if you use PH and Blogger. Thanks Beau!</p>
