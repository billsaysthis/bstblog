<p><strong>ATT Broadband: Really pissing me off</strong></p>
<p>Well, as expected I have been offline since Friday night. And the more I think about the situation, the more upset I am with the geniuses at ATT Broadband. This whole mess was completely preventable and completely forseeable, yet instead of putting their customers first ATT put a few dollars in their pockets first. The expiration of the contract with ExciteAtHome was well-known and other cable company customers (Cox, Rogers, for example) were willing to pay a little more to keep their customers connected until alternates can be arranged. ATT is just too cheap. I really wish I had a good alternative to them.</p>
<p>Reuters has an <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news_company.jhtml?storyid=NEWS.REUT.20011203.N03230125rtr&amp;ticker=T&amp;provider=companynews">update on the situation</a>. Fortunately, I have a buddy who is kind enough to let me hook into the web through his net.</p>
