<p>Well, after much indecision, we finally decided to see <a href="http://www.abeautifulmind.com/">A Beautiful Mind</a> tonight and I'm really glad. The trailers just didn't attract me and the subject matter, a man's battle against mental illness, hit a little too close to home. Still, after most of my family and friends saw it and gave glowing reviews, the time arrived. Apparently I'm not the only one to feel this way because the showing (admittedly, prime time on a Saturday night) was sold out.</p>
<p>Russell Crowe is magnificent and Jennifer Connelly is superb as the woman who sees more than just the social ineptness and around the damaged mind--and no doubt, she is <a href="http://us.imdb.com/EGallery?source=granitz&amp;group=1295&amp;photo=JenniferConnelly_DeGuire_315708_400.jpg&amp;path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Connelly,+Jennifer">amazingly gorgeous</a>--but the performance I truly appreciated was Paul Bettany as Princeton roommate and imagonary friend Charles Herman. Ron Howard is nearly invisible as the director, which I say as a commendation, since one never feels manipulated into some emotional reaction.</p>
