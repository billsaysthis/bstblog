<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/29/opinion/29WED3.html">This NY Times editorial</a> laments the persistent refusal of cooperation from the Bush Administration as "a study in recalcitrance" though I would suggest the authors are not seeing deep enough into this bolt hole. I see it, rather, as another terrifying example of paternalism and creeping towards facism. I don't own a tinfoil hat, even if that might make life easier, but to me the strongmen behind the Administration are much more interested in control than social issues and are simply riding the Religious Right as a useful hobby horse; if the goals were attuned then there would be little or no hesitancy in providing information to a man like Thomas Kean.</p>
