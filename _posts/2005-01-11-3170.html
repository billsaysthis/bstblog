<p>We spent the weekend down visiting my folks in Palm Desert, which as you might expect is a stone's throw over from Palm Springs. Due to the rain and other <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs04/series?series=nyjsdg">overwhelming factors</a>, the only place we got out to visit was <a href="http://www.psmuseum.org/" title="Mom = big Jets fan">Palm Springs Desert Museum</a>, which is small but has a decent collection. Driving yesterday in sometimes pounding rain through the San Bernadino Mountains with poor directions to John Wayne International Airport for the flight home was not one of my more pleasant car experiences but any disappointment was far outweighed by the chance to spend a few days with my parents.</p>
