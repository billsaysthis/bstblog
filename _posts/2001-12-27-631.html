<p><strong>Blogger offline</strong></p>
<p>Apparently Blogger got hacked early this morning and so the server has been offline ever since. For better or worse, <a href="http://www.evhead.com">Evan Williams</a> is Des Moines today and so has been unable to successfully fix things as quickly as he might. Crackers, as he mentioned, have not respect for vacation time. This has hampered (actually prevented) me from updating today. Hope to see you with fresh content tomorrow.</p>
<p>In the meantime, feel free to peruse the new <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?pg=gall&amp;gall=xmas_01">Xmas 01</a> photo gallery with about 20 shots taken during yesterday's visits with friends.</p>
<p><em>Update (9:45 PST):</em> Looks like Blogger is back.</p>
