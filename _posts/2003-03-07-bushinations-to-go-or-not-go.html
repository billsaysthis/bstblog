<p>Tom Shales goes a little Hunter Thompson on GWB: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54629-2003Mar7.html">Bush's Wake-Up Call Was a Snooze Alarm</a> with an analysis of last night's press conference. I was thinking that the president's long pauses were more likely due to him waiting for suggestions from aides. That is, either via an earpiece or a monitor on his lectern, our fearless leader was getting help with his answers and needed a moment to read before speaking. If you believe movies such as <a href="http://www.wag-the-dog.com/">Wag The Dog</a>, such a thing wouldn't be out of the question.</p>
<p>For my opinion on Desert Storm II, I'm wavering but still on the have to do it side. Some on the anti side say it's all about the oil but I think Nobel Prize-winning economist Gary Becker <a href="http://www.businessweek.com:/print/magazine/content/03_11/b3824043_mz007.htm?pi">effectively demolishes</a> that argument. The economics of the situation argue against war or even longlasting sanctions. The French and Russians threaten to veto any Security Council resolution; what's the rush, they ask. And then we find out that a Fench company <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20030307-545570.htm">is selling spare parts</a> for helicopters and jet fighters to Iraq even now.</p>
<p>What about the big crowds turning out in the US and elsewhere to protest this war? I think most of them are scared about the consequences for themselves. There have been, after, press reports in the last week claiming that Iraqi agents are here in America ready to unleash terrorist-like actions on our soil should we invade. After all, some chemical agents (like Sarin) are easily manufactured from ingredients anyone can purchase at the supermarket, so it's not like the agents would need to sneak material in with them.</p>
<p>But these reports are just rumors, of course, unconfirmed. I am not satisfied that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction or is particularly close to getting them; my government may have evidence but they haven't shared it. And at the UN this morning, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/07/international/middleeast/07WEB-ETEX.html">the inspection report</a> stated that documents supporting allegations of a deal between Iraq and Nigeria for the sale of uranium were likely forgeries, though this conclusion is based on interviews with and information supplied by Iraqi and Nigerian officials. The same report explains away the aluminum tubes Iraq bought that were pointed to as evidence of their nuclear weapons program.</p>
<p>People will die if we go in and that is a bad thing. Sometimes, though, events lead down a path with no other destination. Much as <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_03_02_blog_archive.phtml#90410811">I disagree</a> with Bush and his administration over so many things, for now I will cast my vote to go.</p>
