<p><b>Bill really is sick</b></p>
<p>The sore throat never went away and so today I visited the doctor. What did he tell me? I have <a href="http://my.webmd.com/content/asset/adam_disease_tonsillitis">Tonsillitis</a>, which I always thought was generally confined to younger people. Oops, guess not. Fortunately, this case doesn't seem to be serious enough to require an operation, just antibiotics and with any luck relief is only a couple of days away. In the meantime, I can't really talk since it makes me <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=nauseous">nauseous</a>. That doesn't make some people too unhappy.</p>
