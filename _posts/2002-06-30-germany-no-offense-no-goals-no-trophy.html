<p>The end comes and it is the Brasilieros running wild on the field, draped in their green and yellow flags, jumping for joy, and kneeling in prayer. Ronaldo showed everyone he's recovered from the knee injuries and pressure that laid him low for four years, that the last final against France was not his true form, and at only 26 he has yet to see his full potential. Rivaldo and Cafu are a little older but Cafu especially would be brilliant to see in the next go round; there are many young players ready to come on and Big Phil made that point by standing Kaka at the substitute line in the last few seconds. Marcos was strong in goal, getting in front of a couple of rippers, doing what he needed.</p>
<p>If there was a man of the match for the Germans it was the defender Metzelder, only 21 years old, doing his best against the three R's at the back and making it forward for some of his team's best offensive opportunities but without enough of a goalscorer's skills to make a difference. Khan made so few mistakes all tournament long, allowing only one goal before this match, and holding off the much better front line until injury and a weak back line made that too much to ask.</p>
<p>Brazil showed everyone why they are the best with this win. They came in after a weak qualifying round leading most to put them in the second tier behind France and Argentina; those two teams went home after the first round while the South Americans took the 11 pounds of gold and a clean sheet of seven wins.</p>
<p><em>Everybody Samba!</em></p>
