<p>Apparently, the corporation <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/politicsphilosophyandsociety/0,6121,1080220,00.html">needs defending</a> from those who might point out a certain <a href="http://www.deoxy.org/emperors.htm">lack of clothes</a>. I agree with the author of the book review, rather than the authors of the book, and in fact I think that the 1880s Supreme Court decision giving corporations the legal status of persons is one of the worst decisions the court has ever made. Very few of the major ills afflicting our society today will be cured until that is changed in a substantive way.</p>
