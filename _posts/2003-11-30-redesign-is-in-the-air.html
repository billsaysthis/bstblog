<p>A bunch of sites, such as <a href="http://www.whump.com/moreLikeThis/">Whump</a>, <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">Kottke</a>, <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Dave</a> and <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/dustbin/000001.html">Garret</a> have done some freshening up, so I thought perhaps the time had come for minor tuning here too. Dave did more than just change the visual aspects of his site, he re-architected as well and, not to be a Dave-basher, while I like the new design I don't care for the architecture. As for here, there's much more whiteness and the site navigation bar on the left side of all pages has been pruned, with the removed pages transferred to an <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/misc/other.phtml">Etc... page</a>. This was an example of how the use of CSS makes visual changes easy; all I had to do was change the color specified in three styles and <em>boom</em>!</p>
