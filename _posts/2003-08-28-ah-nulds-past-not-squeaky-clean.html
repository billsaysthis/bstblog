<p>Oh the shock and horror of it! Smoking Gun, those guys who seem to find all the most embarassing pieces of paper you never want to see the light of day, did it again, finding a 1977 interview Mr. Universe did with <em>Oui Magazine</em> (you know, it used to compete with <em>Penthouse</em> and <em>Hustler</em>). In the interview, Schwarzenegger was less than discrete, copping to playing in orgies with groupies and consuming mass quanities of mind-altering substances. In radio interviews yesterday, he <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A56941-2003Aug28?language=printer">tried to brush it off</a> by saying he didn't live his life to be a politician.</p>
<p>So Bill Clinton, Gary Hart et al should be forgiven their private life sins? If I remember correctly, it wasn't their fellow Democrats hounding them over sexual matters. No, you remember, it was the Repblicans who tried to push Bill Clinton out of office for having sex with an intern. Should be interesting to see how long Ah-nuld's fellow Cali Rs talk their way past this and other embarassments that are sure to follow; I'm particularly curious to see if they start growing Pinnocccio-like noses.</p>
