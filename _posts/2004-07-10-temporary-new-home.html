<p>The hard drive on Little Steven, my less than year old Toshiba Satellite laptop, was whining like a buzzsaw and finally the machine was constantly crashing. The Big Guy tried his best and with Knoppix we were at least able to boot into that Linux and save some files but it was clear to both of us that surgery was required. Fortunately for me I'd bought the extended warranty for the first time in a long time and so off to Fry's with Little Steven.</p>
<p>Though they made a fuss about waiting 24 hours for a loaner, I asked politely (I did, ask TS1!) to waive that and let me take one home. Give the oft-maligned store credit because the manager did say okay, and here I am typing on a very snazzy ultra-new Toshiba Satellite A75. Very sharp, bright screen, wireless networking built-in that connected to my network no problem. One little fuss: the right button doesn't work and I can't seem to change that, but since I should only have this box for two or three days, no big deal. And I can get my BillSaysThis email through a web interface too, so no problem there either. <em>Nice!</em></p>
