<p>I saw Lord of the Rings today but I'm going to hold off on the review until I see it at least one more time. Unquestionably this is a movie worth seeing, with action, plot, scenic views, and even romance (more than in the book). That last comment is a big part of what's holding me back from writing more tonight; I've almost finished re-reading the book and I think the differences from book to movie are bothering me more than they ought to (poor Tom Bombadill) since they only had three hours to fit everything in. For another weblogger's opinion in the meantime, check out <a href="http://www.platypus.ro/content/other/lotr.html">Jeff's review</a>.</p>
