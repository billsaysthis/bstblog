<p>Politics never end, probably why they call them election cycles, but today at least marks the end of one. Will Davis retain his office, or be replaced by Governator Ah-nuld or Cruz 'till You Lose? Too close to call, apparently, but I'm naturally pessimistic about the outcome. Pessimism being the appropriate emotion here since no matter who is governor next month, none of them are truly qualified or capable of doing what I think is a good job.</p>
<p>Still, we detoured during the Morning Coffee Stroll to the polling place inside a fire station. I think they moved the voting booths there, from a school across the street, because the Registrar is afraid so many ballots stuffed with so many lies will spontaneously combust. Anyway, for the record: no, Bustamante, no, and no; I'm even proudly wearing the I Voted sticker.</p>
