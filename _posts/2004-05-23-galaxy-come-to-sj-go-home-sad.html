<p>With both sides playing squads depleted by injury, the Earthquakes showed their season is getting back on track with <a href="http://www.mlsnet.com/MLS/scoreboard/game.jsp?match=05222004_LASJ">a convincing 4-2 win</a> over the LA Galaxy tonight at Spartan Stadium. Dwayne Derosario got a chance to start up front alongside Brian Ching and showed this is a very strong partnership. Pat Onstadt was good, but not great, in goal in what looks to be the last game he and Derosario will play for San Jose for the next two weeks and possibly.</p>
<p>This is because next Sunday both players will be on the Canadian national squad in a friendly against Wales and then come to visit us in a club versus country match as our northern <del>patsies</del><a href="http://www.canadasoccer.com/eng/nationals/index.asp?sub=2">neighbors</a> warm up for their World Cup qualifier series against Belize and that home and home will be held the following two weekends. The experience ought to be good for our boys but then again, they are the only two MLS players on Canada's squad.</p>
<p>Back to the game. Dwayne really showed some skills and speed tonight, creating and scoring, and easily earned Man of the Match. Landon dropped back into midfield because Ronnie Ekelund was out with a serious viral infection and though he did get off several shots towards goal, most went over the top and none really challenged LA's Kevin Hartman.</p>
<p>Brian Ching was really solid as well, scoring the first goal of the game a few minutes before the half and the second a few minutes after. When Brian Mullan drilled a third in the 54th minute the ending seemed clear. And so it was, but not before the Quakes fell asleep for about 20 minutes and let the visitors get two goals back. Fortunately Dwayne got the finisher 10 minutes before the end, snuffing any hope of a collapse.</p>
<p>The first home win puts us over .500 for the first time this season (3-2-3) and keeps us within three points of the Galaxy, who have played one more game at this point. But injuries are a big problem, with Waibel, Brown, Walker and Dayak also not really game fit, and national team duty coming up not only for the Canadian pair but also Landon and Mulrooney with the US. <a href="http://www.sjearthquakes.com/fan_pages/052004kwc.htm">Dominic Kinnear</a> is doing well so far for a rookie headman but June and July will be challenging if he doesn't get players healthy.</p>
<p>For tonight, though, let's celebrate another fine win, the team's third in a row, and the fifth game without a loss. Next Saturday, the Earthquakes visit the Columbus Crew, a dangerous team off to a slow start.</p>
