<p>Has any movie in recent history gotten worse reviews than the new flick from Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez? Every single review I've seen has not only said don't bother to see this self-indulgent waste of film stock but also called it terrible, sad, unwatchable. I can tell you two people who won't be paying any cash to see it, trust me.</p>
