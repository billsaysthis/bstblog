<p>Showing that blogging continues to penetrate into important intellectual spaces <a href="http://home.uchicago.edu/~rposner/">Richard Posner</a>, one of the nation's foremost legal minds, is guest-blogging at <a href="http://www.lessig.org/bio/short/">Larry Lessig's space</a>. Hopefully a dry run for his own effort. Since the posts do have some preferable sequencing, click the <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">main link</a> and then scroll down to read beginning with the post titled <em>The Changing of the Guard</em> first and move upwards; this is an instance where blogging's reverse chronological posting scheme is less than perfect.<br /></p>
