<p><b>Coming next week: Fall TV Schedules</b>
<p>Can't wait until then to see what's coming (think <a href="http://www.survivor.com/" title="my opinion, for sure">reality shows</a>, sitcoms, a third Law &amp; Order, and a new Star Trek) and going (hint: 3rd Rock, Voyager, Once and Again)? Check out this <a href="http://www.tvinsite.com/broadcastingcable/index.asp?layout=story_stocks&amp;articleid=CA74623&amp;doc_id=25423&amp;display=features">Broadcasting and Cable TVinsite column</a>. The big trend is more reality TV, like a third installment of <a href="http://survivor.cbs.com/" title="official site">Survivor</a> and second servings of <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/themole/mole_home.html" title="another big waste of time">The Mole</a>, <a href="http://www.fox.com/temptation/information.htm" title="at least this one is fun to look at">Temptation Island</a>, and Chains of Love. My can't wait pick is the new <a href="http://www.startrek.com/production/seriesv/default.asp" title="Not a great site but expect lots more once the official announcement comes">Star Trek</a> series, which is rumored to be named Enterprise and be set about 100 years <i>before</i> the original Star Trek (in other words, about 175 years from now). I would definitely be disappointed if <a href="http://www.nashbridges.com" title="guilty pleasure">Nash Bridges</a> and The Job didn't make it back.</p>
<p>How much TV is too much?</p>
