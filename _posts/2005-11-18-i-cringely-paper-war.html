<p>The pundit who would be Cringely loves, and I mean lurves in an unnatural way, to get in as many over the top adjectives and out of the stratosphere rhetorical devices as he can fit in the space of a column but today's <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20051117.html">Paper War</a> has to be a prizewinner even for him. Just consider this brief, two sentence single paragraph excerpt from the middle of the thing:</p>
<p><em>"This is more than another Akamai or even an Akamai on steroids. This is a dynamically-driven, intelligent, thermonuclear Akamai with a dedicated back-channel and application-specific hardware."</em></p>
<p>Yeah but what's he gonna do for next week?</p>
