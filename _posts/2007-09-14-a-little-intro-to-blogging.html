<p>I gave a one hour brown bag tutorial at ProMatch this afternoon on using a blog to assist one's job search. Having promised to post the slide deck online, I decide to try out SlideShare. This is a startup run by Jon Boutelle and Rashmi Sinha, partners in life and business and friends of mine, and I've been looking for an opportunity to use the service since they told me about it.</p>
<p>Don't expect a fantasmagoric, wunderbar preso ;) Just a few high-level introductory slides that I used before diving into the demo, which was the real meat of the hour.</p>
