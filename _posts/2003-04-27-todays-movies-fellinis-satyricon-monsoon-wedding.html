<p>Tivo Suggested that I'd enjoy these two movies and there was nothing else I could find (one can only watch the NFL draft for so long, after all) and so I pushed the button. But I just didn't get either one, sorry. Fellini may be one of the greatest film directors ever but <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0064940">Satyricon</a> is just a rambling incoherent mess of violent colors and homosexuality. I could care less about the latter but give it some context and dramatic tension, not just a poorly-lit set pretending to be ancient Rome. <a href="http://monsoonwedding.indiatimes.com/">Mira Nair's tale</a> of the clash between tradition and modernity was (and this is, of course, just my opinion, no offense to film school students with no sense of humor) more successful but there are too many cultural roadblocks and places where I couldn't understand due to the actors' accents for me to enjoy this one either. I gave both of them about an hour and then I gave up.</p>
