<p>I laughed quite a bit at the 2003 remake of <a href="http://thein-laws.warnerbros.com/">The In-Laws</a> but I still am not quite sure why they bothered. Films like this just don't do big box office--IMDB shows a final US gross of just over $20M--but then Michael Douglas, who stars as the CIA agent here, has a big name but little recent track record of delivering results and Albert Brooks, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_06_08_blog_archive.phtml#200410564">cartoons aside</a>, never has.</p>
<p>Most people would probably prefer the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079336/">1979 original</a>, with Peter Falk and Alan Arkin in the roles played by Douglas and Brooks here, and I can't argue that too much. Today's bigger budgets and better special effects technology are nice but in some ways they make things too easy, too smooth. And Falk just has a little bit more in the way of cranky idiosyncracies that draws one into his clutches than the slick as a used car salesman Douglas.</p>
<p><em>mildly amusing</em></p>
