<p><b>Record Reviews like you've never seen before</b>
<p>Steve Albini's an English record producer who clearly has little or no concern about the reaction his <a href="http://pr0n.newhackcity.net/~rfleming/bigblack/albini_reviews.html">Eyewitness Record Reviews</a> will have from the bands with which he's worked. You and I, on the other hand, get to enjoy his nasty little writeups. Don't worry if you haven't heard of most of the bands, just enjoy the nastiness.</p>
