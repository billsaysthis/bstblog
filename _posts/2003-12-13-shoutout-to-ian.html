<p>I've been using Ian Mead's <a href="http://www.ultraedit.com">UltaEdit text editor</a> for several years now to take care of the various websites and other text files around here. But special thanks to Ian and his associate Troy for their help over the last few days, including late night and Saturday communications, trying and finally succeeding in solving a perplexing problem that popped out of nowhere. Very cool considering I've given them only about $30 in license fees over the years!</p>
