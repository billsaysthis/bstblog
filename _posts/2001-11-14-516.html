<p><b>Paying for the Web: Umm, no</b></p>
<p>(Via <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com">garret</a>) Marshall Brain posits the idea of <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/penny-per-page.htm/printable">How "Penny Per Page" Might Work</a> on his Howstuffworks website. He suggests that you, me, and the rest of the websters pay a penny per page view to finance the web and particularly the content like Google and ESPN that we all love so much.</p>
<p>Worried about sites that would simply take advantage by popping open huge numbers of new windows? Don't be: "The billing mechanism should track for and eliminate charges for that, as well as for pages that auto-refresh themselves, error and non-existant pages, pages arrived at by pressing the back button, duplicate pages and so on."</p>
<p>Just a few other concerns, which the article doesn't address:<br />

<li>Doesn't this violate U.S. antitrust regulations?<br />

<li>Wasn't this already proposed by the people behind micropayment systems like CyberCash, which have since failed miserably?<br />

<li>While $20 per month (his suggestion for monthly cap on the viewing fee) <em>might</em> not be much for an American, what about people in nations like China, India, and so on where $20 is a huge portion of their monthly income?</p>
<p>Marshall, we all want to find ways to ensure that interesting, useful, and meaningful content continues to be available to all, so keep those ideas coming. In the meantime, stick to the <a href="http://biz.howstuffworks.com/phone-scam.htm">really cool articles</a> with which HowStuffWorks <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/black-box.htm">excels</a>.</li>
