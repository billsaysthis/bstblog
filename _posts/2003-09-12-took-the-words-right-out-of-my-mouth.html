<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/12/opinion/12KRUG.html">Today's Krugman</a>: "In other words, if you thought the last two years were bad, just wait: it's about to get worse. A lot worse."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/14/magazine/14TAXES.html?pagewanted=print&amp;position=">This weekend's Krugman</a>: "The astonishing political success of the antitax crusade has, more or less deliberately, set the United States up for a fiscal crisis. How we respond to that crisis will determine what kind of country we become." [<em>via <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/dustbin/000372.html">Garret</a></em>]</p>
<p>And a <a href="http://www.buzzflash.com/interviews/03/09/11_krugman.html">bonus interview</a> with the Princeton Prof, which I wasn't going to link but just fits in too well with this column, and the <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/28237">MeFi discussion</a> where I found it.</p>
<p>Let me be the first to say it: Paul Krugman for President!</p>
