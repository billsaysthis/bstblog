<p>In today's NY Times, Jimmy Carter wrote an essay titled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/21/opinion/21CART.html">America Can Persuade Israel to Make a Just Peace</a> and he falls into the same trap as so many other supposedly learned, informed people: he thinks that giving the Palestinians a state of their own on the West Bank and Gaza will be the end of the matter. Carter goes farther and suggests a "limited right of return" although he takes the weak road and doesn't suggest any detail on how this will be limited. Everybody will then live happily ever after, right? Groups like Hamas and Hezbollah will just lay down their arms and rejoice. They won't try and drive Israel into the sea.</p>
