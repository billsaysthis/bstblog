<p>Betting this title is some kind of children's story? Nah. The 2001 novel by Australian author Nick Earls would go whoosh right over the heads of any five or six year old by focusing on the complex social and emotional interactions of the main characters. Though they'd definitely get at least some of the humor, such as the point of view character's primary work responsibility being to dress up in a huge chicken suit and dance at the street to attract business to Ron Todd's World of Chickens.</p>
<p>Phil is a med student in Brisbane wearing the chicken suit part time to bring in some spending cash. His best mate Frank works the stove when not plotting his next female conquest, which he does regularly and far more successfully than Phil. Our boy is burdened by a conscious, Frank not so much. The lovely Sophie Todd, Ron's daughter, rounds out the WoC night crew and inhabits Phil's fantasies.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nickearls.com/chickens.html">World of Chickens</a> turns on what happens when Ron makes Phil his new confidant, Frank becomes <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs.</span> Todd's plaything and Phil, er, entertains Sophie with tales of his imaginary girlfriend Phoebe. He justifies this as necessary to hold his feelings at bay while she dates the (never seen) Clinton but complicates things by giving his fictional female the same name as his mom (who teaches one of Sophie's university classes) and not reporting any breakup before Sophie spots him on a real (sort of) date.</p>
<p>Frank causes poor Philby no end of complications as well. Not having a conscious seems to be working well for Frank but the gears in Phil's inner courtroom get good and grounded the more he tries to be a good pal and keep confidences. Ron Todd and the real Phoebe put in a few loose bolts as well; the latter's reaction to an innocent--at least on Phil's part--photo is just awesome.</p>
<p>I got this book during our trip to Australia after having read one or two of Earls' earlier novels during my 2000 vacation there. For an American, I think you have to make a few allowances for the kind of things writers take for granted, like local knowledge and language, but overall would give this a thumbs up.</p>
