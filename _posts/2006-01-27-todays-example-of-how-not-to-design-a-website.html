<p>I get a reference to <a href="http://www.devx.com/xml/Article/30300">an article</a> about a tool to tranform files with XML, something that I do from time to time. Reading it, I see it is showing off a seemingly commercial product. So I click to the website. Sure enough there's a free downloadable trial but otherwise it costs cash to use. Still, if this can simplify my life I might spend money. But you go to the <a href="http://www.goxml.com/aboutgoxml.php">GoXML site</a> and tell me, without registering, how much it costs. Really, I dare you.</p>
