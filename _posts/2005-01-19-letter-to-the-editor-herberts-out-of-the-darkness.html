<p>Again I write but find no taker at the other end of the channel. This letter is in response to Bob Herbert's Jan. 17 column <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/17/opinion/17herbert.html?ex=1263704400&amp;en=6e142ed40896eced&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">Out of the Darkness</a>:</p>
<p>I would ask Bob Herbert the same question I have asked myself and others who wonder "Where are today's voices of moral outrage?" Why are you, Mr. Herbert, asking the question instead of providing the answer in the form of your own efforts? Years of writing, from a perspective with which I generally agree, demonstrate a terrific understanding of problems and an ability to reason out good answers. I look forward to reading your final Times column, soon, in which you announce your candidacy for political office.</p>
