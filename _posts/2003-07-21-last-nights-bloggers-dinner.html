<p>Scoble is an excellent organizer. All he does is pop in from his new base of operations with a <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/07/18.html#a3856">brief mention</a> on his blog and a dozen people just show up. If I had only known he was expensing the dinner, I would have ordered the large salad. Macromedia founder <a href="http://blogs.it/0100198/">Marc Canter</a>, he's currently getting another startup called <a href="http://www.broadbandmechanics.com/">Broadband Mechanics</a> off the ground, was there, bringing his friendly but incapacitated wife and really cute little daughter Mimi, and <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> too. Unfortunately Dave was extremely domineering for the first while, only interested in getting sympathy for his position in the more than annoying ongoing fuss over blog APIs.</p>
<p>A bunch of other interesting people were there too. <a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark">Don Park</a>, who I worked with briefly at NetDynamics, <a href="http://www.cohousing.org">Raines Cohen</a>, longtime tech journalist <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0107117/">Scott Mace</a>, new Californian and eBay staffer <a href="http://www.alpern.org">Micah Alpern</a>, uber-techie <a href="http://www.dijest.com">Phil Wolff</a>, <a href="http://www.basilsoft.com/xblog/zellers/index.html">Steve Zellers</a>, who develops big chunks of the Cocoa framework at Apple, <a href="http://niallkennedy.blogspot.com/">Niall Kennedy</a>, who was showing off the Tablet PC he won recently, and one or two others whose names I sadly can't remember. Plus of course Robert and his great, but bored, son Patrick.</p>
<p>I had an interesting time talking (separately or in groups, over the course of the evening) with Lisa, Phil, Robert, Micah, Niall, and Marc. I got a recommendation for the next C# book, since I'm almost finished with the Schildt beginners' book, for Chris Sells's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596003609/chrissells">Mastering Visual Studio.Net</a> but when we went to Barnes &amp; Noble today they didn't have it, so I picked up <em>Visual C#.NET 2003</em> by Steven Holzner instead.</p>
<p>A couple of photos--Scoble Senior, Scoble Junior, and Phil Wolff:</p>
