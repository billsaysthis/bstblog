<p>Here's a good example of a serious difference between US and European pro sports: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/4570313.stm">AC Milan reveal Gerrard interest</a>. If the manager, coach, general manager or owner of an American club, in any league, publicly announced that he's interested in signing the (still under contract) star of another team the league office would be announcing a huge fine and suspension before the story could hit the newswire. Much less if this announcement was made the week before the headman's team and the desired star's current squad are to meet in <a href="http://www.uefa.com/competitions/UCL/FixturesResults/Round=1972/Match=1086988/index.html">the championship game</a>. How can Ancelotti be doing anything except attempting to unsettle Gerrard or other players on the Reds?</p>
