<p>I saw a red Camaro twisted,<br />
<br />Sitting up on the driver's side<br />
<br />Smashed up against a guard rail<br />
<br />Right where her head ought to be.</p>
<p>Police lights were flashing,<br />
<br />Fire trucks racing up the highway<br />
<br />We were hoping they would win,<br />
<br />Reaching her before she was gone.</p>
<p>Thousands of glass shards were<br />
<br />Strewn like a thin glittering stream<br />
<br />Across the highway lanes, thin blood<br />
<br />Ribbons intermingled with the windshield.</p>
<p>As we came even with the ambulance and<br />
<br />Police cars, the EMTs were strapping her body<br />
<br />Unmoving, small and still, hair standing out,<br />
<br />Onto a small gurney for her final ride.</p>
