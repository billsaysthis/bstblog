<p><strong>Borland, as retold in Biblical style</strong></p>
<p>Read the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/28/23747.html">Dead C Scrolls</a> as written by humor columnist Verity Stob, after the King James' Authorised Bible. Sample quote:</p>
<p>When the sons of Kahn looked upon Veesee-ell and Delphi, and they saw that Delphi micturith upon the head of Vi Su-Albahsic, as though from the top of the mountain of Rockee.</p>
<p>More in the same style are <a href="http://www.ddj.com/documents/ddj9806vs/">Yocam Hocum</a> and <a href="http://www.ddj.com/documents/ddj9903vs/">Book of Yocam (contd)</a>. Great laughs!</p>
