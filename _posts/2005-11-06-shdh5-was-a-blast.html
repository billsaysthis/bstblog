<p>Had a great time last night at the Prime, stayed until 2:30! Huge crowd turned out and despite the chill we got a bunch of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laughingsquid/60468425/">good demos and presentations</a>. Big spread of food, of which I ate too much, and lots of alcohol including currently hot combination of Red Bull and Vodka but, uggh, I didn't try it. David Weekly was a terrific and gracious host, he has a house that even I envy over in Hillsborough, and Scott "<a href="http://www.laughingsquid.com/">the Laughing Squid</a>" Beale was again omnipresent with his digital camera so you can see many pictures of the night on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/superhappydevhouse5/">Flickr</a>. Many people spent much of the evening <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laughingsquid/60467122/">playing with code</a>--it was a <span style="font-style:italic;">dev house</span>, after all--though I barely broke out LittleSteven because for me the opportunity for conversation was much more interesting.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laughingsquid/60467163/in/photostream/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/60467163_efcdeea10b.jpg?v=0" alt="Deidre Moen showing me MeasureMap" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>Pitches included:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.an9.org/">Andy Smith</a> did a funny, if questionable, presentation on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laughingsquid/60468861/in/set-1306451/">getting chicks with python</a></li>
<li>Keith H showed us the very hot <a href="http://www.zimbra.com/">Zimbra</a> mail system which won one of <a href="http://superhappydevhouse.com/node/5">the shiny statues</a> for most likely to earn a huge payday </li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laughingsquid/60467777/">Drew</a> talked about using RDF to organize and analyze his four-plus years of gas purchase receipts (later on he showed me a very different kind of webserver called, I think, Redfern which is implemented as an RDF store)</li>
<li><a href="http://overstimulate.com/">Jesse</a> <a href="http://www.voltaiccommerce.com/">Andrews</a> (<a href="http://userscripts.org/">GreaseMonkey</a>, <a href="http://bookburro.org/">BookBurro</a>) on how to build <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laughingsquid/60468828/">your own Google Maps</a> in 10 minutes with almost no code using <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">the Dojo Toolkit</a> </li>
<li>The singularly-named <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laughingsquid/60467928/">Freeman</a> on projects (PostMaNet) he's supporting to bring intermittent connectivity to remote towns in India; we had one of those nearly-midnight nature of existence conversations beforehand </li>
<li>The (recently aqcuired by Yahoo!) <a href="http://upcoming.org/">upcoming.org</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laughingsquid/60468608/in/photostream/">trio</a> showed that being inside the Big Y is will unleash their creativity by giving them a wide palette of components to play with</li>
<li><a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/index.php">Chris Messina</a> discussed the CivicForge project which I missed because, well, it was cold and I needed a break, but which did win another of the statues. </li>
</ul>
<p> Can't wait for the next House!</p>
