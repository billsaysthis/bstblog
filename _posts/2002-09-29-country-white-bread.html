<p>One category of food that most people scream about giving up when confronted with the Atkins diet is bread. I didn't scream but I always answered with that when asked my favorite food. So it's with relief that I can tell you that there now are reasonable choices for us. In the last two weeks we made batches of blueberry and banana nut muffins (both yummy) and country white bread. Note that all these mixes are not cheap: we got a dozen muffins in each batch for $5/box and the bread, which makes one medium loaf, is $6. Each muffin or slice is only 2-3 grams of carbs, though, so we're looking at sandwiches for lunch tomorrow!</p>
<p>The bread's just out of the oven, so I'll update on the taste later, but I can tell you it looks decent. See for yourself:</p>

<p>My plan for dinner tonight is this: one slice of the bread toasted, as a base; next layer is the sauteed (with garlic) cap of a portobello mushroom; and the topping is a small omelette filled with the mushroom stems chopped into small pieces, a little oregano and parmesan cheese for topping.</p>
<p><em>Update, 8:50 p.m.:</em> Well, the dish came out almost exactly as planned though I forgot to butter the toast. Still, cap was moist enough and I did use a little butter in sauteeing them. Here's what it looked like (with a couple of bites alread in the Sweet One's tummy):</p>
