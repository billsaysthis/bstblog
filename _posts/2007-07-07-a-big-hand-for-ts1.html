<p style="float:left;width:375px;">Last Saturday my wonderful wife did something really worthwhile. She and a few of her co-workers raised over $3500 for cancer research as part of the Rally for Life in Fremont. Not only did she get a decent amount of cash donations but she made packets of vegan cookies and brownies for a bake sale too. Working at a lawfirm has its advantages as several of the partners slipped sizable bills into the jar, far more than the price tag for the sweets.</p>
<p>Their team took turns walking around a track behind a high school and manning a booth. Vivian and her friend Crystal spent hours putting together this educational wall board on the dangers of smoking. Visual enough to be disturbing and reminds me once again how foolish I was to have ever been a nicotine addict.</p>
