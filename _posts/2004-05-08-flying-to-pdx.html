<p>So I got to make my first Intransa business trip this week. Very short, up there Wednesday night back home Thursday night, but a very positive experience. While details wouldn't be terribly appropriate, we (I traveled with Jay Weber, one of our excellent technical staffers) did go there to visit with an IBM group in Beaverton and install one of our systems in their lab. At the end of the day we had very positive feedback from the IBM team for the quality of our product and our effort.</p>
<p>I also spent half an hour on the phone at the request of an IBM Digital Media architect speaking with him and one of their solutions partners who's interested in using us as the storage component in some upcoming deals. Participating in sales-oriented situations is definitely something I like doing, a lot, and hope for more opportunies as work goes forward. After all, my predecessor as product manager is now director of Asia/Pacific sales, and the Intransa execs seem very open to such transitions. We'll see.</p>
