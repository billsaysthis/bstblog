<p><b>Boycott Disney</b></p>
<p>Sen. Fritz Hollings, at the behest of the Walt Disney Corp., has introduced the <a href="http://216.110.42.179/docs/hollings.090701.html">Security Systems Standards and Certification Act</a>, a bill that will trample consumer rights into tiny little bits of dust. Criminal penalties for violations start at $500K plus five years as a guest of the Feds and go up from there. What's the meat?</p>
<p>"It is unlawful to manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide or otherwise traffic in any interactive digital device that does not include and utilize certified security technologies that adhere to the security system standards adopted" by the Secretary of Commerce based on input from industry.</p>
