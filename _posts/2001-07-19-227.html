<p><b>When a good man goes bad</b><br />

<p>Back in the 1970s and '80s, Jeffrey Archer was an author whose <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Paris/1292/trilogy.html">novels I  read avidly</a>. He's recently gotten involved in politics in the UK, almost becoming <a href="http://www.londonnet.co.uk/ln/guide/themes/archer.html" title="Very snide humor">mayor of London</a> before being charged (and now convicted) with <a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/dynamic/news/story.html?in_review_id=419917&amp;in_review_text_id=368532">perjury and intending to pervert the course of justice</a> at his 1987 libel trial against The Star. During the suit in which these crimes were committed, he won <a href="http://www.xe.net/ucc/">500,000 pounds</a> from The Star; the tabloid printed a story alleging that Archer paid a prostitute for sex. It's a convoluted story but he apparently lied to bolster the truth, not because he actually paid the pro. But now he's going to pay: 32 months in prison. Archer, of course, is <a href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/010719/4/bypha.html">going to appeal</a>.</p>
<p>And Lord Archer wasn't the only creative type to go down to the law today: Old Dirty Bastard (aka Russell Jones) of rap group Wu Tang Clan was sentenced to four years in NY's finest accomodations for <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/rolls/20010719/en/odb_gets_four_years_1.html">possession of a controlled substance</a>, cocaine and marijuana.</p>
