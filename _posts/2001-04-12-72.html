<p><b>The other side of the Chinese coin</b><br />

<p>Here in the US, most people are furious that it took 11 days to get our soldiers back and that the Chinese leadership was fussing over a word or two in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20010411/aponline104222_000.htm">apology</a>. In China, though, the citizenry is <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/0104/12/update/news107.html">furious at their leadership</a> for giving in too easily. "We've seen what happened after the embassy bombing. A few more incidents like this and the leadership won't be able to maintain its hold on power," said one man. What would happen to US/China relations if there was another (perceived as) bungled incident and Chinese hardliners came into power? Nothing good, I'm sure.</p>
