<p>If you're a user of the free version of Blogger or Blog*Spot and need help, a new and probably useful source of help is the Yahoo! Group started by Phil Ulrich, <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/blogger_user_support/" title="Not affiliated with Pyra">blogger_user_support</a>. Note that this is not an official channel nor is it affiliated with Pyra and no one from the company is even a member. This is a place for user to user support and although it's new, so far people seem to be getting answers. Better than using the Blogger API group, that's for certain.</p>
