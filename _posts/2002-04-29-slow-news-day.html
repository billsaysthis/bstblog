<p>Blah blah blah. New paradigm. Find your inner blogger. Aim for the stars, hit for the fences. Yadda yadda yadda. Use the force, Luke. The check is in the mail. Location location location. There was a young man from Nantucket. I'll pull out. Johnny B. Goode, some day your name will be in lights. Stuck between a rock and a hard place. Vote for the honest politician.</p>
<p>You scratch my back, I'll scratch your's. Why, God, why? I feel your pain. The truth is out there. Clapton is God. Elvis has left the building. The proof is in the pudding. How can I believe you when your hand is in her pants? Don't give up on us baby. I love you. Keep your tongue in your own mouth. Hands off. Denial is a river in Egypt. I wanna hold your hand. Lay lady lay.</p>
<p>Baby we were born to run.</p>
