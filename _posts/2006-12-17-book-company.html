<p>This novel from Australian writer Max Berry is a good companion to Iain Bank's <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/singlepost.php?id=114159240948325195">The Business</a>, covering much the same thematic territory but more of an out and out satire and really none of the SF-ish suspenseful undertone. Both are entertaining, well-written and highly readable.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.maxbarry.com/company/">Company</a> shows us a few months in the trenches at Zephyr Holdings through the eyes of newly-hired university graduate Stephen Jones. The cover art, a single large (glazed) donut, seems odd but is quite appropriate as one of the subplots threaded throughout much of the book is the question of who ate Roger's donut on Jones' first day.</p>
<p>Corporate underlings expending energy for months over this question ought to give you some ideas on Barry's style of humor. Its used to illuminate the main plot, a complete mockery of the ever-changing, ever-pointless corporate management fads. Plus there's lots of orange.</p>
