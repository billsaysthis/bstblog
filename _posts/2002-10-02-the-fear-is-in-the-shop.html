<p>Like many stories, The Fear needs to go back in and retool. I've been able to take it in an interesting direction, or so I've been told, but the current scene at the side of 101 is just getting way too talky and going on too long. And I'm stuck, with the current structure, unable to get Jamie moving again.</p>
<p>I do have a plan for making things work again but this will require a little time. So for now I've taken down the featured link, though the page will remain as is. I hope to have a new draft to release by Monday that includes most all of the content so far; please bear with me as I struggle through the <em>authorial process</em>. Please?</p>
