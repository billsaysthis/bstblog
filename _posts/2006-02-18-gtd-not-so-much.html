<p>Lots of bloggers and other folks have picked up on the Getting Things Done strategy (philosophy?) but not me; my mind just doesn't work that way. But I did start doing one thing that lowers the number of interruptions: I stopped running SharpReader all the time. Trimming the feed subscriptions wasn't enough, the tray icon was still turning yellow far too often and the OCD in me couldn't resist alt-tabbing over to see what had come in. So now I'm trying to limit myself to twice a day, reading the new and then exiting. Will it last? Not sure yet.</p>
