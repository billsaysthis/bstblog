<p>This will cause riots and or dangerous lunatics to get out guns and use them. And not in a pretty, look at the holes I made in the piece of wood way:</p>
<p>"Jennifer Lopez and her fiancee Ben Affleck are talking about making a new version of the classic film, Casablanca. According to London's Express, the celebrity couple is considering the roles played by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the legendary 1942 movie."</p>
<p>If these two stars are so amazingly arrogant to think that they can make this movie, or some greedy studio exec is able to convince them they can, Lopez and Affleck deserve to have their careers head directly to Straight to Video hell, do not pass go, do not collect $20M per flick. Damn!</p>
