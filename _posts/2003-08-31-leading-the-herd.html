<p>You can stand over me, arms crossed, hair styled neat<br />
<br />Express your idea of how a man acts and chooses<br />
<br />Say that you're sorry some decision has been taken<br />
<br />That will be life-changing for me and not in a good way.</p>
<p>I've met you before, over and over, heard your dismissals<br />
<br />Seen you act like an Alpha bull clearing a<br />
<br />Weakling challenger from the heard and thinking the female<br />
<br />Titters were approbation for your aggression.</p>
<p>Dreary, I get so dreary listening over and over to<br />
<br />Words that claim such authority by their delivery yet<br />
<br />Lack the depth and determination which would<br />
<br />Confer your position with true leadership.</p>
<p>Black clouds sit overhead while people gather<br />
<br />Around and listen to the wisdom flowing from<br />
<br />Your corner office while I sit out in the hallway waiting<br />
<br />For the punishment you've planned for me.</p>
<p>You guys are right, you know what must be--<br />
<br />Able to walk and talk through the grey haired<br />
<br />Interest that used to be open to us all but<br />
<br />Now has been thrown out. Like me.</p>
<p>There is strength and power in the world, even<br />
<br />These days where perception has smothered<br />
<br />Reality with artifice, so you can unfold your arms,<br />
<br />Lower your voice and sit down with the heard.</p>
