<p><b>It's a Microsoft world</b><br />

<p>And we're just living in it. The Register has a disheartening <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/53/21003.html">interview  with MS SQL Server VP Gordon Mangione</a>, who points out that (a) Sun and Oracle live and die by each other (which has been pretty true for at least ten years) and (b) SQL Server is beginning to eat up Oracle as Windows gets (arguably) better and <a href="http://www.unisys.com/hw/servers/es7000/default.asp">Intel-based servers</a> get more powerful. Urggh!</p>
<p>Slashdot has a <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/08/14/1210238&amp;mode=thread">raging debate on open source databases</a> that may, as with Linux/Apache/etc..., provide an alternative. The debate was prompted by this <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/intweek/stories/news/0,4164,2802205,00.html">Interactive Week article</a>.</p>
