<p>We just saw a preview of the upcoming Jackie Chan movie, <a href="http://themedallion.emg.com.hk/">The Medallion</a>, and couldn't help but think that it sounds like the producers decided to reuse the script from Chow Yun Fat's film from this past Spring, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_04_20_blog_archive.phtml#200173732">Bulletproof Monk</a>. A martial arts master must guard an ancient object that bestows incredible power on its possessor, some evil guy finds out about it and decides he must have it, thereby imperiling the entire world. Plus there's a hot chick fight between two stunning women who are also martial arts masters. Couldn't they at least have called it a re-imagining?</p>
