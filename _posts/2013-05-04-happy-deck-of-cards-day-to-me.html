<p>52 years ago today, my mother brought forth on this continent a new baby, conceived in, well, let's not go there, dedicated to the proposition that life is wonderful and meant to be enjoyed. And so I have!</p>
<p>For the most part I've had an easy time of it, though into every life some rain must fall, and I won't complain about the storms sent my way. Why should I, when I've had it better than 99% of the other people around me?</p>
<p>Two wonderful parents, a great sister, a loving wife and lately two of the cutest little dogs you'll meet.</p>
<p>So say Happy Birthday to me and I will say thank!</p>
