<p>Karl is running into the reality of increasing popularity and asks: <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/weblog/kmartino/archives/004398.shtml">Anyone want to sponsor Philly Future's hosting?</a> If your company or organization supports grassroots media, community building efforts, web-based experiments or anything of the like, please reach out and see how you can help this active group of Philadelphians continue.</p>
