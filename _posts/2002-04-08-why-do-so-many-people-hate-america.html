<p>And by extension, Israel too. <a href="http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2002/04/HatersoftheBourgeois.shtml">Steven admonishes us</a> to read David Brooks' Weekly Standard article <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/001/102gwtnf.asp">Among the Bourgeoisophobes</a> by asserting "this article is breath-taking in its perception." The article does present at least part of the answer to the question I posed in the title of this post.</p>
<p>So, anyway, this simple American does as suggested and nearly has his brain burned by the light. Well, okay, it was good but perhaps not brainburningly brilliant. Brooks takes a historical look at the roots of the discontent between Europe and America and between (fanatical) Islam and America and finds them in the rise of a group of European <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=intelligentsia">intelligentsia</a> soon after the birth of this nation. These people, such as Stendahl and Flaubert, saw themselves as the moral and intellectual superiors of the crass merchant class which was just then beginning to dominate politcal life and which they saw as the pure heart of America. The article is lengthy and has its flaws but I recommend taking the time to read it.</p>
<p>Charlie Stross, an Englishman, <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blosxom.cgi/2002/Apr/7#blogging_and_bollocks">completely disagrees</a> with Brooks' argument. Stross' main criticism centers on the way Brooks supports his claims by quoting old and dead people rather than more recent sources. Not unreasonable and he doesn't just say the EU is any better; he calls their governments a "pack of chimps." But Stross does err in asserting that America is a global empire on autopilot. Unquestionably America and Americans are the dominant global forces these days but we are hardly an empire and hardly monolithic, even in the moneyed classes who control what force the country does have. And I don't believe we're on autopilot either. For further elaboration, and if you care to add your opinion, try the <a href="http://denbeste.nu/ubb-cgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=000838">Clueless discussion</a>.</p>
