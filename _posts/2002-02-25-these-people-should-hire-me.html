<p>CNet posted an article this morning (<a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-843988.html">BEA aims to broaden its developer pool</a>) about the new <a href="http://www.bea.com/press/releases/2002/0225_workshop.shtml">WebLogic Workshop</a> tool that BEA has just announced. This is probably one of the closest matches in terms of product and target market to my experience and skills, yet my resume has been submitted there twice by BEA employees I know and I haven't gotten so much as a phone call. These people do not understand how much they are missing by not getting me in as Product or BusDev Manager for WebLogic Workshop. Damn!</p>
