<p>In a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml?type=politicsnews&amp;StoryID=560442">speech today</a>, President Bush enlarged his remarks on the American propensity to do what feels good. Observers say this is an attempt to talk us into moving away from the sexual excesses characterized by the Lewinsky scandal. People who complain about others' pleasure are most likely scared of what they would see inside themselves or mentally locked into a rigid belief system that makes their life simple. I always wondered why Republicans (conservatives) are so eager to keep the government out of financial matters but so eager to have it intrude in personal relations; isn't that an odd conflict?</p>
<p>I say to GWB and his corporate cronies, how about looking at your own excesses? That is, the "if we can get away with it, do it!" attitude that led to the <a href="http://www.oliverwillis.com/enrongate/index.php">Enron collapse</a> and the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news_company.jhtml?storyid=NEWS.REUT.20020122.N22121121rtr&amp;ticker=CSR&amp;provider=companynews#">$100 million Credit Suiss First Boston fine</a>. How about letting Congress have the Cheney energy task force information rather than forcing a courtroom confrontation. Poor Mrs. Lay, going on TV sobbing poverty while her husband Ken hides behind his lawyers and, gee, they still have property valued at over $10 million. Puh-lease!</p>
