<p>(TS1 made this up and gave me a framed copy as today's Hanukah present, how sweet is this?)</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">SHERRY DARLING was her name<br />She worked at the CADILLAC RANCH<br />Alas she had a rich boyfriend and friends would tell me<br />YOU CAN LOOK (BUT YOU BETTER NOT TOUCH)<br />I wanted to say these words to her "I have a CRUSH ON YOU"<br />SHE'S THE ONE<br />Sherry, I WANNA MARRY YOU<br />I finally confessed my feelings to her OUT ON THE STREET<br />She Tells me to meet her down by THE RIVER<br />There we made love, TWO HEARTS beating<br />We saw each other for some time and I later find out<br />She's getting married<br />That THE PRICE YOU PAY<br />When you are from the wrong side of the tracks<br />Leaving in a STOLEN CAR..DRIVE ALL NIGHT</p>
<p>I'M GOING DOWN TO DARLING TOWN<br />Men WORKING ON THE HIGHWAY<br />Met a cute lady at the local bar, name was BOBBY JEAN<br />There was NO SURRENDER in those blue eyes<br />She loved DANCING IN THE DARK<br />As we danced close she whispers LET'S BE FRIENDS (SKIN TO SKIN)<br />BABY I'M ON FIRE and I will PROVE IT ALL NIGHT<br />Those were GLORY DAYS</p>
<p>Drove down THUNDER ROAD Needed a place to stay<br />Went to grab a bite to eat at a cafe' called CANDY'S ROOM.<br />WHEN YOU'RE ALONE on VALENTINE'S DAY<br />Oh what a LONESOME DAY.<br />Hiding the pain and sadness. What a BRILLIANT DISGUISE<br />Watching people making out in the TUNNEL OF LOVE.<br />It's just TOUGHER THAN THE REST.</p>
<p>Passing through towns in THE PROMISED LAND<br />RACING IN THE NIGHT. Driving in DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN</p>
<p>Pulled off the road. ACROSS THE RIVER,<br />I could see MY HOMETOWN far in the distance<br />Looking up at the EMPTY SKY, no clouds, just blue skies<br />Break time is over, need to continue for a just a bit more<br />Thinking to myself, I'm COUNTIN ON A MIRACLE for rain<br />FURTHER ON (UP THE ROAD), my final destination<br />MARY'S PLACE</div>
