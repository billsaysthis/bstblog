<p>Not that I'm much of a baseball fan, I didn't even watch <a href="http://www.sportsfilter.com/comments.cfm/3724" title="An awesome, typical SpoFi game discussion">Game 7</a>, but how the fuck did the Yankees lose this series! A day that will live in infamy in New York, for sure. Where's Tony Soprano when you need some legs broken?<br /></p>
