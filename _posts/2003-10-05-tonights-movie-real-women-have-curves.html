<p>Marketing executives have begun to realize that the Hispanic consumers make up more and more of the people spending money in America demographic, hence the numerous Spanish language cable networks, TV and radio stations, and newspapers. All good, all good, for sure but this also means more movies targeting the same audience, and Hollywood likes nothing better than turning out a good chick flick.</p>
<p>Now I'm not a chick, but I've seen and enjoyed my share of them. Sadly, <a href="http://www.realwomenhavecurves.com/">Real Women Have Curves</a> is only a chick flick and not a very good one. America Ferrera is quite appealing as the lead actress, playing Ana, a chubby Mexican girl graduating from high school in Los Angeles. Lupe Ontiveros also gives a real performance as Ana's bitchy, bitter mother.</p>
<p>But even a chick flick needs things like plot and character development to succeed. 90 minutes is enough for the typical teenage-focused movie but writers Josefina Lopez and George LaVoo simply meander among the mother-daughter relationship, the business difficulties of the other daughter, Ana's budding but meaninglessly (artificially?) shortcircuited romance, and her teacher's (played by George Lopez) efforts to get her to attend a good university rather than simply repeat her mother's life.</p>
<p>Director Patricia Cardoso is ultimately responsible for leaving us with little more than eye candy. Movies, the saying goes, are a director's medium and I just never felt her hands shaping and guiding this film. From beginning to end, there is no change in how Ana relates to her mother, no change in how the mother sees her daughters or acceptance that what was the right choice for her 35 years earlier might not be the best option in the new millenium.</p>
<p><em>Not recommended</em></p>
