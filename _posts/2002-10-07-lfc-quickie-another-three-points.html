<p>Amidst a huge sports weekend (the Sweet One like baseball <em>alot</em> more than me), Liverpool's Sunday match against Chelsea probably would have gone missing but in any case Fox Sports World did not choose to broadcast it. Still, the Reds <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/england/2002/20021006/reports/54503_full.html">did defeat the Blues 1-0</a> on a literally last minute rebound put-in by Michael Owen (second consecutive match where Number 10 did all the LFC scoring). The big bad news for the team was the aggravated hamstring injury to central defender Stephen Henchoz who <a href="http://liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N136981021006-1844.htm">faces five weeks out</a> and minor surgery.</p>
<p>Clubs across the Continent now get an early season break, though many of Liverpool's players will not, as the leagues shut down for 10 days for the first qualifying matches of Euro2004 (at Slovakia, home to Macedonia for <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/england/clubs/england/index.html">England</a>). The next club outing is an away match at Leeds United (13 Premiership points after nine games, eight points behind the Reds) on 19 October and a trip to Russia for the return Champions League leg against Spartak Moscow.</p>
