<p>Work is very cool, thanks for asking. This week I spent a bunch of time developing an application in PHP/MySQL that will be deployed to our website when ready. Sadly for you and your desire to drool and fawn over my most excellent creation, it will be in a protected section of the site not accessible to the general public. Still, praise and compliments are easily spewed and I always appreciate them.</p>
