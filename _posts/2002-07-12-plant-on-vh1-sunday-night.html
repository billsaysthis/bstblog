<p>For all us old fogies who won't be up at 11 p.m. this Sunday nigh (7/14), don't forget to set your Tivo to record Storytellers. The Man with the Golden Hair will be the featured performer in support of his new solo release, <a href="http://launch.yahoo.com/album/default.asp?vo=yahn&amp;albumID=1084581">Dreamland</a>. Check out the video of his new song <em>Darkness Darkness</em> on that last link. Not bad, though there's no huge and cool guitar solo, Plant continues his fascination with North African culture and shows no fear of putting his aging mug front and center.</p>
<p>Annoyingly Yahoo! Music went right into the video of the new Linkin Park song <em>"PTS.OF.ATHRTY</em> at the conclusion of <em>Darkness Darkness</em>. As if I want to listen to this crap. Hitting the skip button got me the Eminem video <em>Without Me</em>; is he lobbying for the Robin role in <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/07/10/1540238&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=97">Superman vs. Batman</a>?</p>
<p>FYI, Plant says he has no problem with Cadillac's use of "Rock and Roll" in its current advertising campaign.</p>
