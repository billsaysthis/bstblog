<p>I find blog posts about why the writer isn't posting generally tedious and possibly fatuous. Which is why I like writing them myself. Sometimes I'll think about not posting for a few days just so I can push out another extended riff on how life is like a box of chewing gum.</p>
<p>That isn't the case now, I'm deep in the throes of Harry Potter 5 and celebrating today's lovely 2-1 win by Liverpool down in sweltering Seville. And doing more experimenting with this site and other programming goggles. Microsoft had a crapload of announcements today, none of which thrilled me as much ass they did Robert but hey, he's actually seen them and I'm just reading second hand fluff.</p>
<p>Also wasting time trying to correct a couple of customer service problems. Those are really annoying because I have to use time I could be, um, blogging, to straighten out other people's mistakes or worse. People, we have only so much time on this Earth and I do not want to devote quite so much of it on second and third conversations when one should suffice.</p>
<p>Work is going quite well. Besides the nice mention from Dr. Weinberger, John Battelle's casual slough generated a far bit of traffic (call me any name you want, as they say, just be sure you spell the URL <a href="http://www.rawsugar.com">http://www.rawsugar.com</a>) and other places are throwing visits as well. Tom Carpel, a summer intern, built a <a href="http://www.rawsugar.com/collections/Tomy">World of Warcraft collection</a> wihch is getting notice and many searchers; the popularity of violent games continues to elude me but they are popular.</p>
<p>What I need to find is a simple big of PHP code to parse an OPML file. I've been looking at <a href="http://www.phaedo.cx">Clint Ecker's class</a> but early analysis is not positive, as I prefer something dynamic rather than a generator. Ideas? <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/contact.phtml?sub=OPML%20Parsing%20Suggestion">Let me know</a>.</p>
