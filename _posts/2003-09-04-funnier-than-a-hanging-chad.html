<p>Every week during football season, plus a couple before and after to start things off and wrap them up, the Mercury News publishes a column by Norman Chad. Said column is considered humorous by the editors of numerous newspapers which also print this man's output. But Norman Chad was barely funny four years ago and then his three jokes expired.</p>
<p>As an alternative, Wayne Frazer, a small town journalist and bigtime SportsFilter contributor, is going to publish his version of a funny football picks column every week on SpoFi and if you want to actually laugh, I suggest you spend your five minutes <a href="http://www.sportsfilter.com/columns.cfm/more_ID/55.html">on his work</a> and skip Chad. I give you one sample: in discussing the 49ers-Bears game on Sunday, Wayne comes up with the single best nickname ever given to a sports team, calling them <em>"Your New Home For Crying On The Sidelines."</em></p>
