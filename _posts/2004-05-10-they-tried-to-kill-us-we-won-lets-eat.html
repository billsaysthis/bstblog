<p>Alan King was more of my parents' generation than mine but I did grow up seeing him on Ed Sullivan, the Tonight Show and the movie screen. In fact they saw him live last year and gave a glowing review. King <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/09/national/09CND-KING.html?ex=1399521600&amp;en=5402475aa56235b8&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">died this morning</a> of lung cancer--at 76, less than a year older than my father by the way--and I remember him for his ability to be funny with the old schtick, the jokes and one liners, but also to grow in the '80s and '90s into a modern artist who could convey humor and pathos through stories. The title of this post is a good for instance, one of his gems summing up the essence of all Jewish holidays.</p>
