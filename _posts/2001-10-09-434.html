<p><b>My idea of a great tech article</b></p>
<p>WebmasterBase has published what I consider an excellent example of what tech articles should be like: <a href="http://www.webmasterbase.com/printTemplate.php?aid=529">Migrate your site from MySQL to PostgreSQL -- Part 1</a> by <a href="http://www.designharbor.org/">Nathan Matias</a>. The topic is interesting to me, since I use MySQL and have read many good things about PostgeSQL. What I really want to point out, though, is the level of technical detail Matias provides. The article avoids airy metaphors and claims of greatness and instead sticks to the precise explanation of how to complete the task at hand. When he hits roadbumps, they are described; where there are complications, he explains how to get through them. Kudos, Nathan! May we see lots more work like this.</p>
<p>[Update] Looking at Matias' website I found <a href="http://www.designharbor.org/Coding/printable.php3?id=68">part two of the article</a> and a bunch of other good articles.</p>
