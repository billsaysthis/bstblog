<p>To all the naysayers and wannabes, get down on your knees, listen to me: this weblog made it to a year today. The content may be nearly useless and frivolous but other than the times I was travelling, there are entries for nearly every day of that year. And for the one big trip I took, instead of weblog entries there are the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/italy/italy_trip.phtml">Italy Journal</a> and <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/italy/italy_tripbooks.phtml">Book Reviews</a> instead. Thanks to my friends and family for encouragement and input, my fellow webloggers for inspiration and sometimes material, and Evan Williams for Blogger (even if there are occasional outages), it's been a fun year. Hundreds of posts, a few links to this site from others, over 10,000 visitors since I began monitoring this statistic at the end of last July. I'm not too much given to introspection but to answer the common question of why blog? Huge egoboo (I'm introspective enough to understand that) and a creative outlet.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_03_11_blog_archive.phtml#2791375">very first post</a> was about two near and dear topics, the Sopranos and Rock and Roll and there were 11 posts in all that day. Given my limited understanding of link rot at the time, I'm quite pleased to note that only two of the links from that day are no longer directly reachable, one because I didn't understand that Yahoo! News items aren't saved for long and the other because the company folded. Since then there have been many posts about the books I read, films and TV watched, music listened to, travel undertaken, humor, politics and world affairs (unavoidable post-9/11), sports, science, and technology. Expect more of the same only better as you read I write on.</p>
