<p><em>"Digital cameras, camcorders and cellphones with cameras have been prohibited in military compounds in Iraq," <a href="http://news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,9643950%255E401,00.html">said a source</a> inside the Pentagon, adding that a "total ban throughout the US military" is in the works.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, this is important because the Administration would rather cover up or hide problems than bring them into the light and correct them. Actually, part of the problem is that the Administration doesn't appear to see the <del>torture</del>abuses at places like Abu Ghraib, Afghanistan and Guantanamo as problems needing correction. What I perceive the attitude to be is that some excesses are inevitable and as long as the general direction is towards defeating the enemy, it's all good. Are we actually moving toward a place with greater security? I don't believe so and even some high profile conservatives (not neoconservatives) like retired <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/21/60minutes/main618896.shtml">Gen. Zinni and Tom Clancy agree</a>.</p>
