<p>Posting has been a little light here this week, so like many another blogger I will make my excuses to you all. I'm pretty sick of politics and am trying to avoid posting rant after rant, because I am trying to avoid working up to the fever pitch of said rants. Not good for my mental health, which has enough other challenges, if you know what I mean. On the plus side, though, I am making real progress learning C# and have actually written a couple of little apps that are completely useless except as learning exercises. Also, lunch was had with a dear friend so I could get all the info on her recent romantic weekend and later coffee with a buddy who is extremely well connected in the local work world and always has an idea or three for me. Tomorrow being Thursday, I will try and post another installment of the comic strip; having to work within the limits of the tool, I think that's going fine but I should try and do something a bit more substantive with it or quit.</p>
