<p>"Human thigh bones are stronger than concrete." So I should drink Miller Lite</p>
<p>Amazingly tough guys drive Toyota Tacomas. So I should buy one to be like them.</p>
<p>I'm telling you, it's as bad as spam. Maybe not quite the volume but the intelligence in it. Of course they're all repetitive as hell and so they sink into annoying wasp-like background noise, just another meaningless but necessary task to be attended. I appreciate the need for advertisers, at least on TV, who pay for the content but couldn't the high-paid copywriters at least create some ads that capture my interest more than once a year?</p>
<p>And while TPTB are at it, could someone please send Joe Theisman away somewhere so I don't have to hear his craptastic football commentary any more? No need to rip the thigh bones out of his leg again though if it's really necessary...</p>
