<p>Well, the mystery of baseball suckage has been handled (I'm joking, don't send me any bombs disguised as baseballs) and now I am thrilled to report that the IRS mess is over with as well. The check actually was in the mail and received today. I would include a scanned image but I was so anxious to get money in the bank that I ran right over and deposited it.</p>
<p>Mmmm, closure feels so nice. What other situations can I get to it on? Well, there is this person, who used to be a really close friend, who apparently only has one use for me any more, as a technical resource as he builds his website. He calls once or twice a week and other than a perfunctory "How are you?" has no interest in any conversation other than his question. I really ought to write him an email explaining that this really hurts my feelings. Or perhaps I should just fall back, briefly, into my old passive/aggressive behavior and let him figure it out from this post. Of course, he doesn't really read my weblog even though he is quite well aware of it and has asked me to ue it in the past to promote his causes. I probably wouldn't feel so used if he had actually done the favor I asked of him last Fall, which he agreed to do but never delivered.</p>
