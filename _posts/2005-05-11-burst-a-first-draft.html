<p>The smallest details turn our lives down wildly different paths<br />Butterfly wings, hurricane winds, everybody uses the cliche<br />Then completely forget that cliches are truths indelibly<br />Written into the collective conscious by centuries of experience<br />Emotional bursts pushing momentarily on winds no different<br />Than those the butterflies ride and no more substantial.</p>
<p>A young woman walks through a store door on a Spring afternoon<br />Expecting to see her boyfriend smile and perhaps offer a hug,<br />Instead he's scowling and her arrival startles him<br />Rather than face some intemperate growl she backs off.</p>
<p>Her young man's disagreeable demeanor worsens as her legs<br />Beat a measured retreat, the door's bell rings on exit<br />He slams an open palm on the countertop hard, fast,<br />Enough  to make some loose coins jangle and matchbooks jump.</p>
<p>Romantics say that for every person there's one and only one<br />Perfectly matched soul and so I ask if you meet this person,<br />Start down some golden path and then one day scream<br />Over some trifle, so important in the moment yet so<br />Utterly meaningless, and blast that golden path apart<br />What happens to the joy of that possible future?</p>
<p>Perspective matters, massively, more than readily<br />Comes to mind in the moment when it matters most<br />When a surge of happiness or sadness or pity<br />Courses through your veins and sudden action demands,<br />Heats up a body's temperature to force a choice<br />Dragging the future wherever it winds you up.</p>
<p>Life, I'll say, is a book well-written with characters<br />Who surprise you at times, featuring no balance at all<br />Between good and bad, pleasure and pain, faith and fairness;<br />Simply put, an unending team of runners handing off a baton<br />From one to the next in a marathon relay where no pistol<br />Shot signifies that only a single final lap is left.</p>
