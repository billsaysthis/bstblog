<p>Excellent linkage by <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com">garret</a> last night to a site called <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/">Amercian Rhetoric</a>! The site, developed by <a href="http://www.uttyler.edu/meidenmuller/">Michael E. Eidenmuller</a> (a professor at the University of Texas at Tyler), includes many recordings of famous speeches (audio and video) as well as transcripts where possible. I was browsing through his list of the <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/newtop100speeches.htm">Top 100 American Speeches</a> and thought: If only <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/Ihaveadream.htm" title="MLK's I Have a Dream">the words</a> spoken in <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/barbarajordandnckeynote.html" title="Barbara Jordan, 1976 DNC keynote">those speeches</a> were <a href="http://douglassarchives.org/darr_b17.htm" title="Clarence Darrow, Mercy for Leopold and Loeb">realized</a> in our lives, well, we'd probably find other things to kvetch about since that is the human condition. But we'd be kvetching from a <a href="http://www.usconstitution.com/FranklinRooseveltFourFreedomsSpeech.htm" title="Franklin Delano Roosevelt, The Four Freedoms">much higher plateau</a>!</p>
