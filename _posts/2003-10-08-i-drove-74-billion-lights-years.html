<p>Just to get back where I started from! <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/08/science/08CND-COSMOS.html?hp">Soccer ball</a>? Small (in relative terms only), finite universe is proposed by astronomical researchers though others immediately respond that this 12-sided assertion is incorrect. If this bit of astrophysics research isn't mindblowing enough, just peruse some of the crap at <a href="http://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph/new">astro-ph new abstracts</a> and make sure to bring a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A138232">towel</a> and some beer.</p>
