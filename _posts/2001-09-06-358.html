<p><b>Trekkers are wonderful people</b></p>
<p>Star Trek fans do all kinds of fun stuff--heck, <a href="">GalaxyQuest</a> was a whole movie spoofing Trek fans--but I have to say that Brian Connors has probably taken things beyond any reasonable semblance of a line with <a href="http://www.geocities.com/connorbd/varaq/">How do Klingons compute?</a> He's actually devised a programming language based on how Star Trek's <a href="http://www.kli.org/">Klingons</a> would look at programming, and describes it as "the bastard child of a back-room tryst between PostScript and Lisp after a Star Trek convention." And, de rigeur in this age, the language is open source and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/FAQ.html">freeware</a>. As best I can tell, you can <a href="">actually write programs</a> in <em>var'aq</em> although it is far from being a complete competitor to, say, Perl (which it's written in) or Java. But wacko-way cool!</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: I wrote a note to Brian telling him of this entry and he answered back. "&lt;horntoot&gt;I do take a sort of pride in the possibility that of all geeky things, this very likely might be one of the geekiest in existence. And the amusing part is that there are far greater geeks than I in the world, and yet I cooked up this and they didn't, yes?&lt;/horntoot&gt;"</p>
