<p>A recruiter posted an opening for a <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/KITlist/message/18663" title="This link is hopefully the web version of the posting">Launch Strategy Manager</a> to one of the job groups I read. The location is Midwest/East Coast which, while covering a potentially huge chunk of the country, is probably not geographically suited for me and therefore subject to my piercing wit.</p>
<p>Because the Qualifications, Business Skills and Technical Excellence which comprise the listing, 16 bullet points in all, never actually explain the work the person hired <em>will actually freaking do</em>! Sounds like marketing from the job title but the bullets gives more of an engineering or even operations flavor. My two favorites are:<br />

<ol>
<li>Implements creative solutions to meet staffing requirements that support cross department initiatives. </li>
<li>Creates consensus around new ideas and initiatives, building confidence in the outcome. </li>
</ol>
<p> In other words, you won't get much in the way of budgets or authority but if the work doesn't get done--on time--kiss your tiny little cubicle goodbye.</p>
