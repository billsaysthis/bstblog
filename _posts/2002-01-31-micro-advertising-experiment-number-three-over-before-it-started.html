<p>When one upgrades to the way-cool <a href="http://pro.blogger.com">Blogger Pro</a> part of the incentive in addition to the new features and such is a 8,000 impression Pyrad run. I had mine, it was over and done with in three days or so and I actually got about a 10% overrun (Ev, software needs checking methinks). But talk about your minimal results: two (2!!) clickthroughs for a CT ratio of 0.023%. This one was not much of anything. Tried new wording to no avail. Wonder if Ev is going to start making results available from all Pyrads so potential advertisers can see what's working and what isn't.</p>
