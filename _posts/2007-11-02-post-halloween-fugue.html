<p>I walked out of the coffee shop<br />Late on a Friday early in November;<br />The air suffused with a dense mist<br />A hundred yards in every direction,<br />A pale moon visible beyond it<br />Too high in the sky this time of day.</p>
<p>Cars all had headlights switched on<br />Adding a sense of dark mystery<br />Heightened by the ringing train bell<br />As we walked along the empty sidewalk.</p>
<p>Jake turned to me, his mouth opening<br />About to say something, his mouth catching and closing<br />When he realized empty words were<br />Worse than no words, that any<br />Yammering could spoil our supernatural<br />Illusion before we consumed all its<br />Fantastical, tenuous pleasures.</p>
