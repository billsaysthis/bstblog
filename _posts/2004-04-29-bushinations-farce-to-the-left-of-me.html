<p>In an editorial today (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/29/opinion/29THU1.html?ex=1398571200&amp;en=b605446388cdbaf0&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">The President's Testimony</a>), the Times mentions Bush's frequent nonresponsive responses. But  I'd really like to know why the press corps lets him (and other similarly inaccessible public figures) get away with this. How about asking the obvious followup: "Mr. President, your answer doesn't actually respond to the question I asked. Will you please give us an actual answer?" Is that too disrespectful to our Commander-in-Chief? As they used to say at Heritage Junior High, tough titties!</p>
