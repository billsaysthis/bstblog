<p>The weekend was fun, beautiful, and inspired me to make a few changes. Check the picture at the top left, taken early today, to see what I did. Hope you like the new me. You do like me, don't you? Come on, I work hard to project a certain image and you would not want to spoil that, would you? I've spent nearly 41 years working on this personality, trying new things, changing the ones that don't seem to work. Until we've reached today's finely crafted edition. Anyway, I think I look a lot more like my <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=mom70&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=mom_dad_mom70_12_00.jpg">Dad</a> now, which is good since he's such a cool dude. Even if he does play golf. A lot. And as I was reminded while watching an old ER last night he does look like Tom Bosley. If only I were the movie director that Tom Bosley's (TV) son has become, that would be really cool. What is cool anyway? Fonzi? Janet Reno? So back to me. I hope you like what you see. I know I'm happy with the changes.</p>
<p><em>Update, 4/2/02:</em> Now that the day has passed, here is the "new look" picture I used yesterday:</p>
