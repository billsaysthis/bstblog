<p>140 years ago today, President Lincoln issued the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/ncro/anti/emancipation.html">Emancipation Proclamation</a> and the NY Times was there to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0922.html#article">cover it</a>. A major change in politics, acknowledging that all men are created equal.</p>
<p>"[A]ll persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the executive government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom."</p>
