<p>In the opening match of the new Champions League season, LFC went to Valencia and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/soccernet/LiveCommentary?matchId=62159">lost 2-0</a>. No Owens on offense, per expectations, and (for a second match) no Xavier on defense. But no win either, though Gerard Houllier said it was no surprise and this is the toughest test the Reds will face in the opening round. And Dieter Hamann, so important in Premiership play, took two yellows and turned them into a red card. Still, a draw would have been nice. And Stephen Gerrard says "<a href="http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N136636020917-2239.htm">We can still qualify</a>." Next stop on the CL road is a match next Wednesday at home against FC Basel, sans Hamann.</p>
