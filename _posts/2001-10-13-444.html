<p><b>Today's book: Section 31: Shadow</b></p>
<p>This is the <a href="http://www.psiphi.org/cgi/upc-db/0671774786.html">fourth and final book</a> in the Section 31 sequence. Trek novel veteran co-authors (and husband and wife) <a href="http://www.webwitch.com/westercon52/ruschbio.html">Dean Wesley Smith and Kristine Kathryn Rusch</a> had the toughest assignment, in some ways, since how do you get Section 31 into a story set tens of thousands of lightyears away? Their solution is simple enough, they just have a prologue showing an operative getting assigned to the ship prior to Voyager's relocation to the Delta Quadrant. They pull it off well by using the classic Trek two substories that crash together formula. I think the whole series is worth reading!</p>
<p>Story A is the work of the Section 31 agent and story B has Voyager investigating a pair of stars that are about to collide. Sure enough, there is trouble found, in the form of a slower-than-light generation ship carrying the 800 million survivors of a planet that used to orbit one of the colliding suns; the ship and all its inhabitants will be destroyed in 24 hours by the force of the explosion if Voyager cannot save them.</p>
