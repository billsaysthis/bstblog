<p><b>FBI frustrated, looking to cross the line?</b></p>
<p>Sources are telling The Times of London that the FBI is <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2001350021-2001364909,00.html">considering truth serum, torture, and other techniques</a> that go beyond what is legal in the United States to break a wall of silence from four men being held in connection with the Attack on America. One wonders how this report is possibly accurate since the number of decision makers has to be tiny and the odds of any of those people talking to the press is nearly nil. I could see the use of a truth serum, although I'm not clear on the science.</p>
