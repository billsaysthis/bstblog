<p>I have to admit, we watched <a href="http://www2.warnerbros.com/whatagirlwants/">What a Girl Wants</a> at dinner time tonight. A pretty cute little movie, if more than a bit predictable. I was surprised to see Colin Firth in it but then came the scene where he dances in front of a mirror wearing black leather pants and a t-shirt, playing air guitar to <a href="http://www.superseventies.com/sl_rockandrollhoochiekoo.html">Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo</a> I understood. Oddity: the movie was based on a play written in 1958 by William Douglas-Home whose brother was Britain's Prime Minister back in the day and Firth's character's run for Parliament is the underlying external event driving the film's main conflict.</p>
<p><em>mildly amusing</em></p>
