<p>I've really enjoyed the time off from work, especially the last 10 months with the Sweet One, but now the good times are starting to show a little to much around the midsection. So as of this morning I'm back on the <a href="http://www.atkinscenter.com">Atkins Diet</a>. This <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_07_07_blog_archive.phtml#85227392">controversial though proven diet</a> helped me lose 39 pounds a couple of years ago and I expect to do even better this time. I don't expect to say too much about specifics here too often but I am looking forward to fitting into the shirts and pants right now sitting unwearable in my closet.</p>
