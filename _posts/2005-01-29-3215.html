<p>Reading the vendor and customer responses to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/28/science/28cnd-key.html?oref=login&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5094&amp;en=48eb306a45a3b7a0&amp;hp&amp;ex=1106974800&amp;partner=homepage">Students Find Hole in Car Security Systems</a>, I can only sadly laugh. Because even if these people are correct and the possibility of packaging the necessary computer power in a small enough container to avoid detection is unlikely today, and I'm not in agreement that it is, then just wait 18-36 months and surely it will be. Admitting a mistake of such magnitude--over 150 million of these 'secure' RFID chips are in commercial products today and millions more are being sold every month--just goes against human nature and corporate profitability, so one cannot be surprised..
