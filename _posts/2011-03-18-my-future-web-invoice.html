<p>Reading MC Seigler's <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/18/killing-cable/">Netflix Original Content Is Much More Than A Strategy Shift â€” It Could Shift An Industry</a> I thought again about cutting the cord. Our household is a very heavy consumer of cable content: soccer on Fox Soccer Channel, Gol TV and ESPN, movies and series on HBO, Showtime and Starz, original cable series on SyFy (though much less so than I would have expected if you asked 30 years ago!), USA, FX, AMC and A&amp;E plus the normal fare from the <del>five</del>four main over the air networks.</p>
<p>Accordingly we pay Comcast a pretty hefty fee, adding on broadband internet to the above. North of $200 a month to be honest.</p>
<p>What if we could just buy the broadband from Comcast and get the sports and entertainment content online, per Siegler's post? That would mean paying the higher internet fee--somehow Comcast gets away with charging about $15 a month more if you don't take both cable and internet.</p>
<p>I made a list, and am probably missing a couple of things, but even so we'd save a chunk of money:</p>
<table>
<tr style="font-weight:bold;">
<td class="s0">Item</td>
<td class="s1">Cost</td>
<td class="s1">Notes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="s2">Broadband</td>
<td class="s3">$60.00</td>
<td /></tr>
<tr>
<td class="s2">Netflix</td>
<td class="s3">$10.00</td>
<td /></tr>
<tr>
<td class="s2">HBO</td>
<td class="s3">$10.00</td>
<td class="s4">HBO/Cinemax</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="s2">SHO</td>
<td class="s3">$10.00</td>
<td class="s4">Showtime/Movie Channel</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="s2">Fox Networks</td>
<td class="s3">$10.00</td>
<td class="s4">includes FSC, FSD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="s2">Disney Nets</td>
<td class="s3">$15.00</td>
<td class="s4">includes ESPN</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="s2">NBC Nets</td>
<td class="s3">$5.00</td>
<td class="s4">includes Versus, USA, SyFy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="s2">CBS Nets</td>
<td class="s3">$5.00</td>
<td class="s4">includes Comedy Central, MTV+</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="s2">Starz/Liberty</td>
<td class="s3">$10.00</td>
<td class="s4">Starz, Encore</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="s2">Total</td>
<td class="s3">$135.00</td>
<td /></tr>
</table>
<p>Wonder how soon I'll really be able to do this. Networks, can you feel me?</p>
