<p>Another reason we did the right thing in Iraq: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2951615.stm">Abu Abbas was captured</a>. Abbas was a senior leader in the terrorist Palestinean Liberation Front and responsible for the 1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship during which a 69 year old crippled American man, Leon Klinhoffer, was murdered. Abbas was sentenced to five consecutive life sentences in absentia for that attack and presumbly he will now serve the time. He's been hiding and working out of Iraq for the last 17 years. <em>Good riddance!</em></p>
