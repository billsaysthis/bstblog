<p>As I was leaving this morning, another member of the self-inflicted pain brigade held the door open for me and said "This is my favorite exercise, pushing the door open to leave." I think he held the door open for me just so he could have an audience for his quip.</p>
<p>Still, this was my fifth workout since starting last Thursday and no matter how boring, tiring, painful, or whatever, I am not quitting. You hear that, Mr. Fate?</p>
