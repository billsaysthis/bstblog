<p>I you live in one of the 10 states holding primaries today, don't not vote. That is, VOTE. Don't use lame excuses, especially the one that begins "My vote doesn't matter because..." Too many people felt that way in 2000 and look where we are. Think of this as a practice run for November, to ensure that GWB is shown the door.</p>
<p>I had the privilege of escorting a first time voter to the polls this morning. She was a little nervous about the whole thing but afterwards admitted that her fears were groundless--she even thanked me for the encouragement. Very nice.</p>
<p>VOTE!</p>
