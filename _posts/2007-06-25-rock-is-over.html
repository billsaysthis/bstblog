<p><a href="http://www.littlesteven.com/">Steve Van Zandt</a> has found plenty to keep himself busy in between ever-rarer E Street gigs and Sopranos filming, but I don't think I realized he writes regular commentary for The Hollywood Reporter until seeing <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Music/06/25/music.vanzandt.reut/index.html?section=cnn_latest">today's posting</a> via CNN.com. His primary argument is difficult to disagree with, even if it goes totally against my grain: rock bands today are smart to get their songs in movies and commercials.</p>
<p>What really got my attention though was his near throwaway claim in the second sentence that we've passed out of the rock era: "With the end of the rock era (1965-1994), the rules began changing just as fast as the technology."</p>
<p>The rock era ended 13 years ago? Damn, no one told me. We is old, baby, and "out here on the perimeter there are no stars."</p>
