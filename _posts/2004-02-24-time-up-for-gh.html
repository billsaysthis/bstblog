<p>In an (admittedly scientifically invalid) poll, Soccernet readers are voting 83% in favor of LFC manager Gerard Houllier's dismissal. After recent events like the inability to score against bottom dweller in the FA Cup defeat Sunday and sitting 26 points behind EPL leaders Arsenal with the season 60% done, I'm going to agree with the majority. I also get the feeling that Chelsea headman Claudio Ranieri will face the same fate come the end of the season--I saw his team's match against Arsenal Saturday and, regardless of a first minute score, the Blues were totally dominated.</p>
