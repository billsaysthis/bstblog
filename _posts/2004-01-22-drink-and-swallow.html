<p>I generally prefer not linking Yahoo! News stories because they evaporate after a week. However, this headline is too good to pass up: <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=ap-superbowlads-samples&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns">Some ads to run during Super Bowl</a>. Those ads, BTW, include all three prescription pills to make you hard and plenty of beer.</p>
