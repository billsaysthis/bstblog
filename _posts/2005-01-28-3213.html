<p>I found out the endings today to Clint Eastwood's critically acclaimed <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/?p=5848">Million Dollar Baby</a> and Julianne Moore's quickly forgotten <a href="http://www.moviepooper.com/pooperpg2.html">The Forgotten</a> and am even less interested in both of them now. A filmmaker's resolution for the plot is so important yet so difficult but in these two movies I have the impression they took the easy way out, though in Eastwood's story one wonders what a (non-schmaltzy) ending could have been substituted.<br /></p>
