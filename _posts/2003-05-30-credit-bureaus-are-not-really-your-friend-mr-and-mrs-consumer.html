<p>Watch out for your credit history, problem's not just from identity thieves but <a href="http://www.sunspot.net/business/bal-creditlede052603,0,3161713.story?coll=bal-business-indepth">from the companies</a> that keep and rate your credit. Their mistakes can haunt you for years, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/29/business/29CRED.html">costing you real money</a>. Private business with big lobbying budgets and lots of friends are finding little difficulty operating in our modern milieu.</p>
