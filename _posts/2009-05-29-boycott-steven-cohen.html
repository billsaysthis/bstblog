<p>[This is the letter I sent Fox Soccer Channel today in support of the <a href="http://boycottstevencohen.webs.com/">Boycott Steven Cohen campaign</a>]</p>
<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>Steve Cohen has, and not for the first time, told lies about the deaths the 96 fans at Hillsborough, claiming that Liverpool fans were responsible for killing their own, amongst other lies. Is this the type of person you want representing your company? Steve Cohen has done this before, apologising when the outrage grew too large only to continue with his comments a short time later. Clearly, he will not stop, so our objective is to see him being put off air permanently.</p>
<p>Fox Football Phone-in used to be enjoyable and good for a laugh but now I cannot watch it at all. If there were another way for me to watch English football than FSC you can be sure I would.</p>
<p>I urge you to reconsider your use of Cohen.</p>
<p>I will be posting this message to my blog and elsewhere until your support for Steve Cohen and his lies ends.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br />Bill Lazar<br />http://billsaysthis.com</p>
