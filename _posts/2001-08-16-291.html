<p><b>This is a test post</b><br />

<p>Richard Caetano is developing <a href="http://www.caetano.com/richard/software/bloggercom/">bloggerCom</a>, which I am using to create this log entry. As this is my first test and this is really early in the development of the whole project, I'm not sure it will work. But let's see...</p>
<p>[After initial post from bloggerCom] It worked! Cool. The past eight days have seen an amazing and impressive flurry of <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/directory/1568/services/pyraLabsblogger">activity</a> after <a href="http://www.evhead.com">Bloggermeister Evan Williams</a> published the first Blogger XML-RPC API, of which bloggerCom is a part. I've been subscribed to the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/bloggerDev">mailing list</a> from the start and the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/bloggerDev/members">level of involvement</a> is one of those great things no one expects. Dave Winer, author of the web's original weblog, has been <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2001/08/13/connectingWithBlogger">deeply involved all along</a>--way to go Dave--even adding support for the API to his company's products. Even though they run a competing weblog <a href="http://www.editthispage.com/">service</a> or <a href="http://www.weblogs.com">two</a>. I've even offered to help someone working on a PHP implementation.</p>
<p>What I want, and seems like this will be available in days or less, is a Windows-based client that has at least the functionality of the online Blogger editor. The online tool's biggest weakness, I think, is dealing with templates and I'm hoping somebody brings a better solution to the table.</p>
