<p>This posting is really just for my future recollection. Liverpool FC are going all guns now, following up the 4-0 win over Real Madrid with a 4-1 win at Old Trafford and yesterday's 5-0 Anfield thrashing of Aston Villa. The latter, coupled with a second straight ManUtd loss and Chelsea's surprising loss to Tottenham, means there are at least two teams who can win the Premier League and neither plays at Stamford Bridge... or the Emirates.</p>
<p>Villa were hoping to push into the top four but based on recent form this seems unlikely. Martin O'Neill is a pretty good manager but has overworked his shallow squad and its beginning to affect results. Lucky for him there's an international break before they have to go to Manchester United.</p>
<p>With frontman Dimitar Berbatov likely to miss due to an ankle injury, no Wayne Rooney or Paul Scholes--both bad boys got reds on Saturday--and an off-kilter Cristiano Ronaldo, will O'Neill deploy an aggressive front line of Heskey, Carew and Agbonlahor in a 4-3-3 to try and extend Sir Alex's misery?</p>
<p>The Reds go to Fulham the day before, and the Cottagers will be proud of their victory, but I think the traveling squad will be too much for Roy Hodgson's backline, too eager to make up points dropped earlier this season that evaporated what was an eight point league table lead prior to Christmas.</p>
<p>Reds have won four straight, scoring 16 and conceding one--ONE!--goal since the wakeup call at Middlesboro. They've taken 13 of 15 possible points against the other three Top 4 teams.</p>
<p>Torres did not get any of the goals against Villa and that's got to sting. Riera will want more of the plaudits he's had the last few weeks. Reina is making the stops and setting up goals. Stevie G is being called the in-form player period, in any league.</p>
<p>Look out this week to see Gerrard and Benitez get player and manager of the month awards. Fulham, just look out ;)</p>
