<p>Another little technical concept checked off my list today with the help of Rogers' very useful <a href="http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/news/2767/displaying-xml-data-php">Displaying XML Data with PHP</a> and his <a href="http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/xml-simple">Simple-XML class</a>. Want to see it in action? Easy enough, just click through to <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/poetry/poetryhome.phtml">my Poetry page</a>. In the previous iteration the list of poems that runs down the left was hardcoded into the page source and when I write another poem I need to edit it. In the new plan I cut all that into a new file, did a little search and replace magic and spinned it into an XML file. XML= cool, eh?</p>
