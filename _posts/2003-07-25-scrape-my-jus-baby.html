<p>What a strange feeling today. Should not really be tired, slept well, went to the gym, had coffee and tasty breakfast. But just hardly have any energy. Read Chapter Two of VC# Kickstart. Old <em>Roseanne</em>, still funny. Drew Carey insane. Wow, you got invited to a party? Phil is on vacation, blame him. What is Karl being so mysterious about? I do not need Human Growth Hormone Therapy, trust me, stop asking me to buy it you fuckers. This is an ingenious story...[it] rocks. Pure cash rocks.</p>
<p><em>Later</em>, a cow walked into a bar but saw that a priest, a minister, and a rabbi were already there. Still, he gritted his teeth, such as they were, and when the bartender asked for his order, said "White Russian." The rabbi looked him over and said it was okay with him, no circumcision means not a Jewish cow. The minister told the barkeep that no good Irishman would drink Vodka, so go ahead and pour. The priest wanted to know if the cow realized that the drink had milk in it; the cow said sure, and what do you care, I saw you pick your nose and eat it.</p>
