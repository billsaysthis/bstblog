<p><b>Gone: Douglas Adams</b><br />

<p>At the age of 49, <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010512/ts/people_adams_dc_1.html">Hitchhiker's Guide to Galaxy author Douglas Adams died</a> yesterday of a heart attack. This is very sad news as Adams was one of the few who could write really funny science fiction. I suppose it's difficult to think of a book as funny when the Earth is destoyed in the first chapter to make way for an interstellar highway bypass but at least Arthur Dent got a ride off planet beforehand with a copy of a book with the words DON't PANIC emblazoned on its cover. An amusing related website is <a href="http://www.vogon.com/guide/">Vogon Heavy Industries</a>, a little outdated effort from the megacorp that demolished Earth. If you haven't read these books yet (there are five in the "increasingly misnamed" <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/creations/hhgg.html">Hitchhiker Trilogy</a>), read them now!</p>
<p><i>So long Douglas, and thanks for all the fish</i></p>
