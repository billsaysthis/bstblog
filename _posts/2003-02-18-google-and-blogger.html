<p>Most of the commentary so far is filled with sturm und drang about how Google either will elevate Blogger (users) unfairly compared to other weblogging tools or else didn't need to buy Blogger to achieve whatever unstated goals they have. Big whoop. I did point out on Anil Dash's <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?archives/005129.php#comments">G+B entry comments</a> that one possible value not many folks were seeing yet was a combination of Blogger and the Google Search Appliance as a real Intranet-focused killer app. (Thanks to my man <a href="http://www.lakefx.nu/">Dan</a> for pointing out my scoop on <a href="http://www.blogroots.com/comments.blog/274#1985">BlogRoots</a>!)</p>
<p>But the best comment comes from Jason Kottke in <a href="http://www.kottke.org/03/02/030217you_put_blog.html">You put Blogger in my Google! You put Google in my Blogger!</a> And he made me laugh.</p>
