<p>From this week's <em>frontline</em>, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/credit/">secret history of the credit card</a>, are a couple of interviews that a perfect examples of doubletalk and evasion that just drive you nuts. The one with <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/credit/interviews/williams.html">julie l. williams</a>, acting comptroller of the currency, is particularly sad since she's part of our government, while <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/credit/interviews/yingling.html">Edward Yingling</a> is less surprising but no less disheartening since he's the mouthpiece for the big banks.</p>
