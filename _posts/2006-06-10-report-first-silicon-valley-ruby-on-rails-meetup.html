<p>Last night was the first <a href="http://ruby.meetup.com/72/boards/view/viewthread?thread=1935474">Silicon Valley Ruby on Rails meetup</a> and I can tell you it was an impressive first meeting. Turnout was 50+ people (okay, 50 guys and two or three women), we had good presentations from
<ul>
<li><a href="http://prolificprogrammer.com/%7Ehdiwan/blog/">Hasan Diwan</a> discussing his Quicken-ish replacement <a href="http://prolificprogrammer.com/%7Ehdiwan/blog/2006/06/09/new_finance_release.html">Finance on Rails</a> and also mentioned some plugins he found really useful such as undo_helper, validates_date_time, Cartographer and continuous_builder.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.billkatz.com/">Bill Katz</a> explained his <a href="http://writertopia.com/developers/authorization">Authorization Plugin</a></li>
<li><a href="Seth%20Banks">Seth Banks</a> wowed the crowd with his <a href="http://dev.subimage.com/projects/substruct">Substruct</a> open source e-commerce/content management engine</li>
</ul>
<p>Much thanks to Zachary Taylor and Mark Smallcombe of <a href="http://www.insiderpages.com">InsiderPages.com</a> for organizing and hosting the meetup, and for the delicious pizza.</p>
