<p>We come back from the gym, eat breakfast, and when I check the web, Liverpool FC have broken out of their funk, at least enough to take an away win at Charlton in the EPL. That's first. After blowing out of the Champions League, then losing the top spot in the Premiership, then losing to injury depleted Man United, Houllier needs to make the team win. I read that Owen and Baros have scored and at least one of the following go net as well: Murphy, Hamann, Riise.</p>
<p>Through the late morning and early afternoon we watch Virginia Tech shake off their late season funk, realize they have a chance to make the year mean something, and put together a slim but real victory of the Miami Hurricanes. Four weeks ago this would have barely been an upset, with Miami at a low point and VT riding high, but the teams have each gone the other way since.</p>
<p>Then at 3:00 we dig in for Georgia-Arkansas in the SEC Championship. This would be annother long shot, but I know that the good ol' boys at Arkansas can beat the (third ranked) good ol' boys from Georgia. Even though it's essentially a Georgia home game only an hour drive from their campus.</p>
<p>This combination of unlikely results would be incredibly sweet and put USC into the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl against Ohio State for the national championship. And only possible because somehow the Trojans slipped ahead of idle Iowa in the BCS rankings.</p>
