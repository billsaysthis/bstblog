<p><b>Beware of liquidation preferences</b></p>
<p>Jamie Earle warns those techies still looking for a piece of the IPO pie to <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1273-210-7375440-1.html?tag=bt_bh">Read the fine print</a> before signing on. Looking to ensure returns in these post-bubble days, venture capitalists are seeking even more onerous terms than before. Earle specifically focuses on liquidation preferences, which gives an investor first cut at a predetermined piece of a sales prices. Nasty business!</p>
