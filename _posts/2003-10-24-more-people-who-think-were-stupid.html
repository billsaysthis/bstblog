<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/24/national/24FLOR.html?th">Victory in Florida Feeding Case Emboldens the Religious Right</a>: Politicians looking for re-election and consolidating party gains, playing to the extremists. Florida used to be solidly Democratic, even after most of the rest of the South shifted, and I think people in the southern part of the state need to be more frequent in getting to the polls. Same topic as my <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_10_19_blog_archive.phtml#106692567906549374">letter to Jeb Bush</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/24/business/24TAX.html">House Leaders Are Pushing to Cut Corporate Taxes</a>: the bill was drafted by Rep. Bill Thomas (of California!), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who justified the new <del>giveaway</del>proposal because it is less generous to companies than one he floated earlier this year. $60 billion in additional tax breaks but no mention of fixing the low income tax credit problem in last year's tax cut. Deficit? We have a budget deficit? Whatever.</p>
<p><em>Bonus note:</em> Antonin Scalia only seems really stupid when he <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/wire/Politics/ap20031023_2301.html">gives speeches</a> ridiculing his colleagues on the Surpeme Court.</p>
