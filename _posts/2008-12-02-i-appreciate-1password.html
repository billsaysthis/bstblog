<p>Every Thanksgiving the team at <a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/">Agile Web Solutions</a> give a present to their customers. This year the present was up to three licenses of <a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password">1Password</a> to give away to family or friends. Not cut down, limited or expiring after one update licenses but regular, same as paid licenses. I love this application, it's a huge time saver, and so I found three Mac users who somehow hadn't even heard of this great tool and gave them the licenses.</p>
<p>For those of you who don't know about it, 1P "is a Password Manager that uniquely brings you both Security and Convenience. It is the only program that provides Anti-Phishing protection and goes beyond password management by adding Web Form Filling and Automatic Strong Password Generation. All your confidential information, including passwords, identities, and credit cards, is kept in one secure place provided by Apple's OS X Keychain."</p>
<p>Comes with an iPhone app too, which is especially handy for quick logins on the small screen.</p>
<p>How will they top this next year?</p>
