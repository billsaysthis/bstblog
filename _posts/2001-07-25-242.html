<p><b>Bill is not above pandering</b><br />

<p>There is a cool new blog running around out there called <a href="http://talkingmoose.manilasites.com">Talking Moose</a> for the past few weeks and is gathering reams of attention. While the blog is self-attributed to  "the WatchMoose of the Internet, living in a mud bog in Wyoming", the real author prefers to remain anonymous and this is only adding to the mystique. Since TM appears willing to link to anyone who links to him, I sent the following email yesterday in a blatant attempt to get some TM coolness for BillSaysThis:</p>

<br />Subject: linking</p>
<p>&gt; Mr. Cool Moose,<br />
<br />&gt;<br />
<br />&gt; Dave has never linked to my blog:<br />
<br />&gt; http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogger.phtml<br />
<br />&gt;<br />
<br />&gt; Do you think it's because I user Blogger? LOL<br />
<br />&gt;<br />
<br />&gt; Keep up the cool stuff and I'll keep reading.<br />
<br />&gt;<br />
<br />&gt; Bill</p>
<p>Notice I was not quite so blatant as to ask for a link directly. It didn't work, or at least not yet as I haven't been mentioned. <a href="http://www.calottery.com" title="Buy Bill a lottery ticket to make him feel better">Boo hoo</a>.</p>
