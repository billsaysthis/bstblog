<p>Need a <a href="http://rob.crabapples.net/archive/2004_11_14_default.htm#110080234278899751">great programmer</a>? <a href="http://www.crabapples.net/rob/">Rob Fahrni</a> is available and has deep experience with C/C++/Win32/COM and is now using C# and the .NET framework, not too mention his work history includes several years at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> in the Visio team. He's in Visalia, near Fresno, in California's Central Valley but in this age of virtual teams and distributed development, that ought not be an issue for a smart development manager.</p>
