<p>According to Mercury News TV columnist Charlie McCollum, <a href="http://www.hbo.com/films/angelsinamerica/">Angels in America</a> is possibly the <a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/entertainment/columnists/charlie_mccollum/7386051.htm" title="Scroll down link to find his comments">best show ever</a> made for television. Premieres this Sunday, Dec. 7, at 8 p.m. with the conclusion the following Sunday. Just so you know, he said this show all by itself is a reason to subscribe to HBO. Directed by Mike Nichols, stars Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, and Emma Thompson. <a href="http://endeavor.med.nyu.edu/lit-med/lit-med-db/webdocs/webdescrips/kushner1050-des-.html">What's the play about?</a></p>
