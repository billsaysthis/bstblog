<p><b>OLGA, she's a sweet girl</b><br />

<p>Now, now, she's not my new special friend! OLGA is <a href="http://www.olga.net/">The On-Line Guitar Archive</a>, a collection of user-supplied chords or tablature files for songs. The songs cover pretty much all styles of music, from <a href="http://www.olga.net/dynamic/browse.php?printer=1&amp;local=main/b/bach_johann_sebastian">JS Bach</a> to <a href="http://www.olga.net/dynamic/browse.php?local=main/s/springsteen_bruce/">Springsteen</a> to <a href="http://www.olga.net/dynamic/browse.php?printer=1&amp;local=main/l/linkin_park/one_step_closer.tab">Linkin Park</a>. Since the site depends on submissions, not all the files are complete or completely accurate but I've found pretty good material here over the years.</p>
<p>OLGA long ago ran into Napster-like opposition from music publishers and, in fact, lost it's original academically-hosted home after threats of a lawsuit from EMI. Indeed, for some time in the late '90s OLGA was completely offline. Recently, the organizers incorporated to better meet any future legal threats. I'm really surprised the <a href="http://eff.org/">EFF</a> isn't helping them out but I have pointed out the possibility to them.</p>
