<p><b>Farrakhan 'sorry for anti-semitism'</b><br />

<p>Attempting yet again to gain entry to the United Kingdom, Louis Farrakhan apologised through his lawyers for anti-semetic remarks has has made during his career, according to <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2-2001241132,00.html">The Times of London</a>. Farrakhan's lawyer "admitted that Mr Farrakhan had made “sensitive” remarks about blacks and Jews in America, and about American support for Israel but said the comments had to be set in context." What context? Farrakhan for years has used the Big Lie technique to further his own (admittedly good) cause at the expense of Jews. Like many another before him, Farrakhan is getting old (67) and sick (prostate cancer) and he sees the likelihood of achieving his life's dream receeding and so he is willing to begin compromising on what was so clear to him in younger years, to get the dream within elusive reach.<br /></p>
