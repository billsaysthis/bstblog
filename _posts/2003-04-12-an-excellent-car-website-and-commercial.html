<p>Honda UK has put up a <a href="http://www.honda.co.uk/newcars/accord.html">smashing page</a> for the new Accord, truly taking advantage of Flash, which includes one of the most striking car commercials I've ever had the pleasure of viewing, <a href="http://www.honda.co.uk/newcars/accord300k.html" title="Link goes to high speed/high resolution download version">The Cog</a>. A Rube Goldbergian, Euro modern version of dominos falling; I wonder if they used every single part that goes into the car.</p>
