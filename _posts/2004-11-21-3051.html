<p>Did you see U2 on last night's SNL? They were excellent, of course, performing <span style="font-style:italic;">Vertigo</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own</span> and for the first time in all the years of this show that I can think of, came back for a third song (<span style="font-style:italic;">I Will Follow</span>, from their first release almost as long ago) during the wasted couple of minutes that generally precede the credits. And apparently went on to play at least one more for the studio audience as the broadcast ended.<br /></p>
