<ul>
<li>Surprises: <span style="font-style:italic;">Pan's Labyrinth</span> losing Foreign Picture, Melissa Etheridge beating the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dreamgirls</span> trio, Alan Arkin's dignified acceptance speech</li>
<li>Fine choices: Martin Scorsese finally getting the little golden man, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/movies/2006/11/happy-feet">Happy Feet</a> and <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/movies/2006/07/an-inconvenient-truth">An Inconvenient Truth</a></li>
<li>Weird: William Monahan clearly used too much Valium, Ellen Degeneres as usual</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall this was definitely one of the better Oscar shows I can recall. The historical montages for Best Foreign Films, America and Errico Morricone were excellent, though I could have lived many more years without hearing Celine Dion singing any song.</p>
<p>We didn't see too many of the major nominees, hence the lack of predictions this year. With the sweet new hi-def screen that trend is likely to continue.</p>
