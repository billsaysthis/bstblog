<p>The unstoppable gravitational pull of the future landed another right hook this week with the announcement (to be taken with a large grain of salt, until confirmed) that <a href="http://www.meta-religion.com/Spiritualism/Ufo_cult/raelians.htm">the Raelians</a> have created a human baby through cloning. Jason Levine, however, <a href="http://q.queso.com/index.php?archives/001118.php">strains credulity</a> by expecting strict rationality from a cult that believes Humanity was brought to Earth 25,000 years ago by aliens AND that was founded in France. Jason, thanks for the laugh.</p>
