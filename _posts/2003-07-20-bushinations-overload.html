<p>I wanted to write a little something about the whole State of the Union/<a href="http://www.sfnewmexican.com/main.asp?SectionID=2&amp;SubSectionID=8&amp;ArticleID=30107">faked intelligence</a> controversy. Or maybe all the <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/archives/003385.html">American soldiers dying</a> in Iraq while Bush is here pushing inanities like "Bring it on." Or the way his leadership on budget issues <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/19/opinion/19KRIS.html">is decimating state and local governments</a> and their ability to deliver vital services.</p>
<p>Seriously, though, it's all too much for me and I'm overloaded, and the big shiznit here, the recall of Gov. Gray Davis, hasn't even started in earnest yet. We need a break--how about if everyone everywhere in the world just takes the next week off and goes camping or swimming or playing with family? I'm out of here to go to <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/07/18.html#a3856">Scoble's meetup</a>. With any luck, the people there will just be talking about tech. Or movies. Or movie tech.</p>
