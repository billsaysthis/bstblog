<p><strong>As the worm turns: HP/CPQ deal going down</strong></p>
<p>In a new blow to Carly Fiorina and her absurd plan, the Packard Foundation today <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/yhoo/story.asp?source=blq/yhoo&amp;siteid=yhoo&amp;dist=yhoo&amp;guid=%7B3178DB33%2DB4FB%2D44D0%2DAE11%2DE6CF4E6C3550%7D">voted to oppose the merger</a> between Hewlett Packard and Compaq just weeks after the sons of Hewlett and Packard announced their decision to vote no. This means that a block of 18% of HP stock is now against the plan and one has to think the opposition will strongly influence some big institutional holders. With any luck, even though the companies said they still expect the merger to go through, it will go down like a dog and Fiorina will run screaming into the night. This merger makes little sense from a revenue perspective and even less viewed through the HP Way.</p>
