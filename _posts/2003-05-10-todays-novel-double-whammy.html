<p>Carl Hiaasen published <a href="http://www.carlhiaasen.com/books/double.html">Double Whammy</a> back in 1987. Still extremely readable, it's one of those broken down private eye tales where, of course, the private eye solves the mystery but not after extreme jeopardy, the bad guys pay in strange and painful ways, and the protagonist goes home still sad and broken down. I've got another Hiaasen paperback towards the top of the stack and I'll give more of a write up after that's read.</p>
<p><em>Enjoyable</em></p>
