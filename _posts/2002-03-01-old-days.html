<p>This afternoon the <a href="http://www.chicagotheband.com/discography08.htm#Old">Chicago tune</a> was running through my head as I was driving away from the iPlanet/Sun campus in Santa Clara. I was there to have lunch with a couple of buddies and afterwards I wandered the halls (shh, don't tell Security) saying hi. Hard to believe its been more than a year since I last worked. There or anywhere. Which needs to change but in the meanwhile with the beautiful weather I'm enjoying.</p>
