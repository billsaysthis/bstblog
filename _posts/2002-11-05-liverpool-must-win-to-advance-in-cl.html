<p>After today's predictable <a href="http://foxsports.lycos.com/content/view?contentId=742122">2-0 drilling</a> of Moscow Spartak by FC Basel, the Reds cannot settle for a draw next Tuesday. If LFC do not win outright, they will be left in third in Group B and the Swiss side will advance instead. Suckage! The Anfielders are playing extremely strongly now, at least in English competition, but other than the Russian patsies have not done very good work in Europe, just one home draw in the first match against FC Basel and two losses to group leader Valencia.</p>
<p>Speaking of English competition, tomorrow is the first Worthington Cup match of the season. They'll host Southampton, whom they beat 3-0 in the second game of the Premiership run on two goals from El Hadji Diouf. M. Houllier <a href="http://www.soccernet.com/england/news/2002/1105/20021105lfcbabbel.html">has said</a> that both Michael Owen and Jamie Carragher will be rested but Markus Babbel will return for the first time since being diagnosed with Guillan-Barre syndrome at the start of this season, Chris Kirkland will get a chance to play goal for the the first team, and Diouf is seeking a return to play after finding his place mostly on the bench since Southampton's visit. Saturday sees the Reds on the road for a tough matchup with Middlesboro; Owen and Carragher are set to return for that one.</p>
