<p>I made my first visit to a <a href="http://www.periodontists.com/gum_disease.htm">periodontist</a> today for a consultation after a recent series of visits to the dentist. A new dentist, here in Mountain View, very good, with good office support staff (if you want a referral just ask), who did a serious deep cleaning and other work. She got me to floss for the first time in my life by showing me x-rays of my mouth and after six weeks I can see real improvement in most of my gum so I'm converted.</p>
<p>Two things made this visit no very funny. First, there was a family with the appointment ahead of mine and the father was going over and over about the treatment plan and then about the payment plan. I can understand that people want to know what's going on in their (spouse's) mouth and pay the least amount possible but not when you're costing me upwards of half an hour. Second, after looking at my mouth and poking me with a sharp probe, the good doctor says I need some hard work on my lower gum. Then I can only eat soft and not too hot food for two weeks. I can put it off for a few months, to get a good start on <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_09_01_blog_archive.phtml#85403069">the diet</a>, but then it's novocaine and the knife.</p>
