<p><b>Amazon, NBC make a smart deal</b></p>
<p>The top etailer and the top TV network are <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1007-200-7731414.html?tag=mn_hd">hooking up</a> in a deal that will post books, music, and other products recently shown on NBC, CNBC, and MSNBC on a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/nbc">special Amazon page</a>. The page will be promoted with short commercials on the NBC channels.</p>
<p>I think this is a really smart idea. I hope over time they will expand the project to include previous posted goods--"Oh yeah, did you see that book about germs they mentioned on Dateline a couple of days ago?"--that you could look up by date or show. This seems like such low hanging fruit that I'm really surprised no one has done it before. This deal is a good example of what John Sviokla, writing in CIO Magazine, calls <a href="http://www.cio.com/archive/051501/new.html">being a 24-hour, 3-D marketer</a>.</p>
<p>The closest to this that I've read about is still mostly vaporware, a system that allows viewers to press a button on their TV remote control and order a product being shown at that time. Developed by <a href="http://www.wink.com">Wink Communications</a>, this system requires a cable or satellite vendor to integrate Wink technology into their settop boxes, remotes, and office systems. After five+ years, Wink hasn't made much headway.</p>
