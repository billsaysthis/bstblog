<p>In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/12/opinion/12DAVI.html">A Brief History of the Multiverse</a>, astrophysicist Paul Davies attempts to debunk the <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/Physics/courses/A07/studentsites/studentsites2001/WAG/Multiverse.html">Multiverse paradigm</a> on the New York Times OpEd page. Certainly Davies is better educated in these matters than I but his argument seems to boil down to "Gee this is an extemely complex way to explain what we see and therefore must be wrong." He does point to certain implications of the theory that are certainly difficult to believe.</p>
<p>A little <a>Googling</a> into who <a href="http://aca.mq.edu.au/pdavies.html">Paul Davies</a> is, though, turns his credibility <a href="http://www.socialistfuture.org.uk/msf/ideas%20and%20philosophy/god's%20last%20stand.htm">straight upside down</a>. Dr. Davies has spent much of the past 20 years researching and evangelizing the Intelligent Design crapola mascarading as science. Enough so that Wired recently called him <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.12/pope_astro_pr.html">The Pope's Astrophysicist</a> and that he <a href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~theo0038/newsflash.htm">won</a> the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion in 1995, only two years after Watergate burglar <a href="http://www.templeton.org/prize/pkwin.asp">Charles Colsen got it</a>.</p>
<p>So of course he has a need to show that any new theory in physics has to either be proven wrong or shown as another path to God. Even fellow non-doctorates Penn &amp; Teller were able to debunk Intelligent Design in a <a href="http://www.sho.com/ptbs/topics.cfm?topic=c">recent episode</a> of <a href="http://www.sho.com/ptbs/">Bullshit</a>. ID is the current smoke and mirrors conservative Christians use to put a scientific sheen on their completely non-scientific belief in God.</p>
<p>Religion, by definition, is a belief system, one taken on faith in the absence of tangible proof, so the whole idea of formulating a scientific explanation seems weird, like just another marketing ploy. And it doesn't discredit a truly scientific, if young and not yet mature, theory such as the <a href="http://www.qubit.org/people/david/Articles/Frontiers.html">Multiverse</a>. Sorry Paul.</p>
