<p>Thomas Friedman wrote a column titled <em>"The End of the West"</em> the other day (<a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/29333">interesting MeFi discussion</a>) and I'm beginning to wonder if modern technology should have more of an impact on politics, specifically in terms of international alliances, then tradition or geography. France seems to match up better with China, on numerous levels, than it does with America, while we match better (current Administration twits aside) with countries like Poland, Taiwan and Argentina than France.</p>
