<p>Pete from <a href="http://www.blogofdoom.com/archives/000186.shtml">The Blog of Doom</a> was one of several to report getting offers for his domain from Brandon Oropallo of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hs=h5b&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22verisoft+llc%22&amp;btnG=Search">Verisoft LLC</a>. These were all in the area of $1000, which seems pretty pricy considering the offer was only for the domain name, not the content or other material. Pete's got a good name, I'll grant him that, especially with the upcoming <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0419706/">Doom movie</a>.</p>
<p>Still, I was surprised to receive an offer from the same guy of <strong>$2300</strong> for <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/">billsaysthis.com</a>! Too bad he didn't offer me the money for <a href="http://www.capspace.com">capspace.com</a>, I'd definitely part it with for that sum. Maybe he'll read this and make the offer. TS1 and I have a vacation a'planning for winter and the cash would be sweet.</p>
