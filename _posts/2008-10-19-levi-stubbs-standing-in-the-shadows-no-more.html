<p>The lead singer of the Four Tops passed away Friday after years of bad health, leaving behind a massive legacy of great Motown soul made with his partners Abdul "Duke" Fakir, Renaldo "Obie" Benson and Lawrence Payton. Fakir is the lone survivor, still touring more than 50 years after the group came together as the Four Aims. Stubbs is survived by his wife of 48 years, an amazing achievement in business where marriages seem as transient as last summer's catchy pop hit.</p>
<p>The group's music was a staple on the old WABC AM Top 40 radio of the late '60s and I fondly remember seeing their televised 'battles' with fellow Motown hitmakers The Temptations. Levi had a strong baritone which added weight to the often poignant lyrics of hits like <span style="font-style:italic;">Baby I Need Your Loving</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">It's the Same Old Song</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Standing in the Shadows of Love</span> and, my favorite, <span style="font-style:italic;">Reach Out I'll Be There</span>.</p>
<p>Thanks for the great music and the reminder that <span style="font-style:italic;">It's All in the Game</span>.</p>
