<p>House majority leader Tom Delay <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/07/politics/07delay.html?ex=1254801600&amp;en=a0efaed998ca4c60&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">got yet another slap on the wrist</a> from the House Ethics Comittee for using federal resources to further his Texas political machinations. And, as <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/?p=4832">Garret points out</a>, this is from the same people who tried to run our last real President out of town over getting a blow job.</p>
<p>More than anyone else I can think of, this congressperson is responsible for the terrible partisanship in Washington and replacement of the Contract for America Republicans with the current Contract on America crew. Delay was an exterminator before he got into politics: Can someone please tell me how he's qualified to be one of the most senior politicians in this country?<br /></p>
