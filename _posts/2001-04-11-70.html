<p><b>Stretching the Boundaries of Moore's Law</b>
<p>We all want faster CPUs, memory, and so forth, meaning the chips have to get smaller and pack more transistor equivalents on them. Today, Intel and a consortium of chip companies <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/is/20010411/bs/stretching_the_boundaries_of_moore_s_law_1.html">announced</a> they have successfully developed the first prototype of a 10-foot-tall cylindrical lithography machine. The machine could help produce chips running tens of times faster than today's quickest. Go team go!</p>
