<p><b>The Top Five List has a really funny joke today</b><br />

<p>Your attention, please:  Would the owner of the large jet with "Air Force One" painted on the side of it please come and claim your teenage daughter at the airport bar?</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.topfive.com">Top Five List</a> is one of several daily email lists published by Chris White; I've been reading it for at least the past 2.5 years and it's been worth reading almost every day. Today's list topic is Signs Satan is Your Gym Teacher. You can subscribe by sending email to <a href="mailto:Top5-subscribe@topica.com">Top5-subscribe@topica.com</a>. Other lists include The Whack Report, The Daily Probe, and Gadget Geek (none of whic I've read). BTW, the joke above is copyright 2001 by Chris White.</p>
