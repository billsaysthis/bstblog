<p>We received in the mail today a beautiful, thoughtful holiday gift, a pair of stainless steel <a href="http://www.zepter.com/main.php?lang=en&amp;conn=1">Zepter Home Art</a> cooking tongs, from our dear friend Annie in Hungary. What a sweet person! These really are lovely and I can't wait to use them to make a delicious meal.</p>
