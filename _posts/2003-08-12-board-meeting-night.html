<p>Board meetings are only every other month because I don't think anyone would agree to serve if they were more often. Tonight, for instance, we got the pleasure of starting off with four complaints from a single homeowner. Any one of his issues wouldn't have been to bad but the sum was just a bit too much. Then came the 800 pound gorilla, discussion and approval of the annual budget: a $50 monthly increase in the unit dues.</p>
<p>Doesn't that just suck? There is no real alternative, though, as we're going to have a major repaving next month and roof replacement program beginning next year. Previous boards (for what reason I'm not sure, probably inadequate reserve studies) just didn't put enough money away in the kitty for this stuff and we'll have to make it up now. Uggh!</p>
<p>Thankfully when I walked in the door just before 8:00 TS1 had a delicious dinner of BBQ boneless country pork ribs and spinach ready for me. And a public TV station was showing a classic 1980 Beach Boys concert from Knebworth (that's in England), one of the last shows with all six of the original Boys together on stage. Talk about your California chill pills!</p>
