<p>Detroit was a hotbed of speculation and you have to wonder if owner William Ford is just to cost conscious to pull the trigger while still owing so much money to Millen and Mornhinweg; next year should be a very different story if the can't get the Lions up to seven or eight wins. New Orleans, I think, is still a possibility for a change depending on how the playoffs, Jacksonville, and SF shake out. Hazlett for sure has to make the playoffs next season to keep his job.</p>
<p><em>Updated 1/16:</em> Jacksonville named Del Rio as coach. Speculation is Baltimore Ravens scouting director Phil Savage will be named the new GM this weekend.</p>
