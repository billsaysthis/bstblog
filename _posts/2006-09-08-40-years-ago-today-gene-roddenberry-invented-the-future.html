<p>Sort of. For my money <span style="font-style:italic;">Star Trek</span> was the first modern filmed science fiction and the first episode <a href="http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/editorials/article/25215.html">aired 40 years ago tonight</a> on NBC. We can argue over the relative merits of TOS, TNG, DS9, VOY, ENT, the Saturday morning cartoon and the ten movies but this series (along with Kubrick/Clarke's <span style="font-style:italic;">2001: A Space Odyssey</span>) set the tone and made commercially possible everything since. <span style="font-style:italic;">Star Wars</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Battlestar Galactica</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Blade Runner</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">GalaxyQuest</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Lord of the Rings</span>--I don't know if any of them would have been made if <a href="http://www.roddenberry.com/">Gene</a> didn't convince Desi Arnez and the NBC suits to put his "Wagon Train to the Stars" on Friday nights for three years.</p>
<p>I'm sure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Roddenberry">The Great Bird of the Galaxy</a> is sitting up there drinking with James Doohan and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeForest_Kelley" title="DeForest Kelley"></a>DeForest Kelley and laughing over the mess we've made of his creations and I don't care. Mr. Roddenberry, thanks for the literally thousands of hours of fun, excitement and entertainment!</p>
