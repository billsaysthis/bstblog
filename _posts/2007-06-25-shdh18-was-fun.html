<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/strategicpause/613040301/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/613040301_6ed871864b.jpg?v=0" alt="me hard at work" /></a>After last weekend's <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/search/ci_6162860">big feature article</a> in the Mercury News (<a href="http://www.mercurynewsphoto.com/2007/06/16/superhappydevhouse/">see video</a>), you won't be surprised that the turnout was bigger than ever at <a href="http://superhappydevhouse.org/SuperHappyDevHouse18">yesterday's SuperHappyDevHouse</a>. I thought it was pretty cool since <a href="http://height1percent.com/">Richard White</a>, creator and lead developer of <a href="http://activescaffold.com/">ActiveScaffold</a>, was also there and he gave me some handy advice on adding an Admin dashboard to the new Ruby on Rails app I'm developing.</p>
<p>There were <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/fenchurch/616689210/">many</a> people <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/fenchurch/615998915/">wearing</a> amusing <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/fenchurch/615914002/">hats</a>. Someone ran a script sniffing the network for Yahoo and Google searches and projected <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/strategicpause/612760475/">the flow</a> on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/strategicpause/612760015/">the wall</a>. Even another <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/nicolewong/608577656/">photo of moi</a>, though I resisted the urge to guzzle Red Bull.</p>
<p>Next SHDH should be around the end of July, if—and you should be—you're interested.</p>
