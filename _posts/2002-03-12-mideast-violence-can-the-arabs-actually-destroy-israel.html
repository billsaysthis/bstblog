<p>Thomas Friedman is one of the most important voices on understanding what is happening in the Middle East. His most recent column is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/10/opinion/10FRIE.html">A Foul Wind</a> and he gets right to this question. Not his opinion of the likelihood but rather what the young people, the ones who are most likely to act, think about it. Frighteningly, the answer seems to be that these people more and more believe the answer is yes:</p>
<p>"A visiting Egyptian official told me that he was recently speaking to Arab students about Middle East peace and one of them interrupted to say that with just "eight small, suitcase-size nuclear bombs," the whole problem of Israel could be eliminated."</p>
<p>For a Jew, Friedman is surprisingly well connected in the Arab world. He points to the recent peace proposal from Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah as an important step in getting a moderate Arab voice injected into the debate. Someone better step up to that plate and soon.</p>
