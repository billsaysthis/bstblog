<p>The Senate Majority Leader, already <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_06_22_blog_archive.phtml#105675877448835800">under scrutiny</a> as spokesman for Republican revisionism, has now come forward with a proposal in response to this week's SCOTUS anti-sodomy law ruling. Frist is suggesting that he may put up a constitutional amendment which allows marriage to occur only between one man and one woman.</p>
<p>But his own language undercuts his position. If marriage is a sacrament, as he said on today's episode of ABC's <em>This Week</em>, than there is no way under the American system of separation of Church and State that this amendment should be enacted. One might argue that other laws, such as prohibitions on murder and theft, are rooted in religious belief but these laws also have distinct value to society independent of theist dogma.</p>
<p>Prohibition of same sex marriage, conversely, has no such value. One might, possibly, argue that such unions will not produce children but then again, neither will all heterosexual couples. No, the only justification for such laws is personal distaste for such behavior and even though this distaste is widely-held cannot pass muster. Sacrament, indeed, shows that this is and ought to remain a personal mattter.</p>
