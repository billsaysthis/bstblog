<p>After a few years I was inspired once again to make a tracking page for the NFL head coaching changes, probably because of the quick trigger firing of Denny Green and the liar liar pants on fire behavior of Nick Saban. Page will be updated as more changes, departures and hirings, come down the tubes:</p>
<p><a href="http://billsaysthis.com/content/entertain/football_coaching_07.php">2006-07 CoachingGoRound</a></p>
<p>(Previous CoachingGoRounds: <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/content/entertain/football_coaching_02.phtml">2001-02</a> <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/content/entertain/football_coaching_03.phtml">2002-03</a>  <a href="http://billsaysthis.com/content/entertain/football_coaching_04.phtml">2003-04</a>)</p>
<p>Note that the Matt Millen watch is on, once again, despite his apparent retention of the Lions presidency as Detroit have, by far, the worst record in the league over his entire seven year tenure.</p>
