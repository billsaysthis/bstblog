<p>Happy as I was to see <a href="http://brucespringsteen.net/">him and the gang</a> at the San Jose Arena <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_08_25_blog_archive.phtml#85390490">last August</a>, I am in no way happy that the 2003 portion of his tour has not arrived, and apparently will not arrive, in the Bay Area. I mean, if <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/nm/20030705/people_nm/music_springsteen_dc_1">he can play</a> Fenway, Comisky, Comerica, and Miller (all baseball parks), how can he skip what I'm told is the most beautiful of them all, Pac Bell Park?</p>
<p>This bit of crankiness was inspired by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/16/arts/16BRUC.html?th">reports</a> of last night's kickoff concert at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. An awesome concert, of course, but also: "No human being has sold more tickets to more concerts in a series, making it one of the biggest stories in open-air entertainment since the Christians and the lions." 10 concerts in the stand, all sold out, 55,000 tickets per show (at a more than reasonable for these days $55 and $75 per), total gross of over $38 million.</p>
<p>And I wasn't there! You might question the quality of sound at a huge open air stadium but I've seen him there before, on the <em>Born in the USA</em> tour and it was just fine by me. After all, sonic quality in your average sports arena is somewhere in the range of tepid lemonade and a dogs playing poker signed lithograph. I do have anice consolation prize though: my friend Annie from Budapest traveled up to Vienna for the band's concert there last month and she sent me a t-shirt. Which I now treasure. If you can hear me, Bruce, please make Northern California one of the rumoured five dates still to be named on the tour!</p>
