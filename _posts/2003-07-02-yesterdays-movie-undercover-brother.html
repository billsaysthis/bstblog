<p>The Man is keeping the brothers and sisters down but never fear, <a href="http://www.undercover-brother.com/">Undercover Brother</a> and the Brotherhood are on the job. Mr. Feathers thinks he can stop a brother and Sistah Girl from defeating The Man's plot to brainwash all brothers and sisters, but not when White She Devil makes it a threesome. Especially not in this funny flick, sort of a black Matt Helm to Mike Myers' Bond update.</p>
<p>Eddie Griffin has the title role, and a 'fro to go with it. <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Ellis,%20Aunjanue">Aunjanue Ellis</a> plays Sistah, Chris Kattan is Mr. Feather, and Denise Richards is White She Devil (yup, that's the actual character name and Mr. Feather introduces her as "Black-man's Kryptonite"). Really good casting and a bunch of decent actors in supporting roles (Chi McBride, Dave Chappelle, Neil Patrick Harris, and Billy Dee Williams), not to mention a really funky soundtrack.</p>
<p>Malcolm Lee, Spike's cousin, directed and does a reasonably good job here. It's his second film in the chair as he also wrote and directed 1999's <em>The Best Man</em>. John Ridley (<em>Three Kings</em>) wrote the script based on an Internet cartoon he created--<a href="http://www.urbanentertainment.com/2/animation.asp?type_id=49&amp;cat_id=52&amp;cat_type=Animation&amp;aff_id=2">the cartoon</a> can still be seen on the Urban Entertainment website.</p>
<p><em>Definitely Recommended</em></p>
