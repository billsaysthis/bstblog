<p>Two webloggers, <a href="http://www.encorswish.com/">Chris</a> and <a href="http://www.lotsofco.org/">Max</a>, have unveiled <a href="http://www.encorswish.com/burnbabyburn.htm">Burn, Baby Burn!</a>, "the first round of the Weblogger CD Swap!". Their idea is to sign people up, each of whom is to pick out a set of summer-themed songs, burn those songs onto five CDs, and then send those CDs to other participants. In return, each will get a CD from five other participants with those people's favorite summer songs. Amusing, entertaining, and precisely the kind of violation to which record companies point when they ask for legislation such as the DMCA and SSSCA. And from my perspective they are quite right to complain about this kind of swapping, since the participants are unlikely to use these CDs as samplers and then go out and buy the licensed works. No mention by either of the initiators of this little shenanigan of any intellectual property issues. And another reason not to participate: I'd likely end with five CDs worth of dreck like <a href="http://www.artofthemix.org/FindAMix/getcontents.asp?strMixID=23663&amp;format=CD">this compilation</a> from Max's site. [via <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com">garret</a>, who should be wary of shaving his legs for any reason!]</p>
