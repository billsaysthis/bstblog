<p><b>Yesterday's book: Avatar Book II</b><br />

<p>Wait a second! I just read two books, or at least a novel split over two books, called The Avatar and nowhere in these books does the avatar make an appearance! Not that <a href="http://www.psiphi.org/cgi/upc-db/0743400518.html">Avatar</a> isn't a good read but somehow I feel gipped. We do meet the new DS9 characters, including the Jem'Hadar Odo really sent (Taran'atar), the Andorian engineer Shar, ex-Starfleet/ex-Maquis security chief Ro Laren, and Starfleet troubleshooter and new DS9 XO Elias Vaughn. O'Brien and Worf are gone, although Worf will definitely turn up in <a href="http://www.psiphi.org/cgi/upc-db/0671785540.html">other ST novels</a> as the Federation ambassador to the Klingon Empire, and it's unclear when or where Sisko and Odo will turn up. It will take awhile before we learn more, as there are only two DS9 novels to be published between now and September 2002, when we'll get a four book series, and they're both part of cross-Trek series.</p>
<p>PsiPhi has a <a href="http://www.psiphi.org/cgi/upc-db/feature/new-ds9/">bunch of info</a> on the DS9 Relaunch including character, schedules, and excerpts.</p>
