<p>I understand why <a href="http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/thirteen/">Thirteen</a> drew such a high level of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2003/11/21/thirteen_2003_review.shtml">critical acclaim</a> and <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0334/sinagra.php">appall</a>. The story, partially based on the life of co-star/co-writer Nikki Reed, shows how Reed's Evie comes into the life of Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood), another sweet young (13 year old) girl, and nearly destroys her with drugs, sex, thievery and lies. Not sure why director/co-writer Catherine Hardwicke felt the need to use the nearly cliched opening scene that's set just before the climax and then jump back to the story's beginning after the credits but it doesn't add anything for me.</p>
<p>The movie's intense and frightening yet also seductive; is as often wishing that Tracy will pull Evie out of her pit as worried that Tracy'll be pulled down; the ending, interestingly, is ambiguous so we're left to our own conclusions. The performances are everything--little of the plot is surprising in general terms--and besides outstanding work from the two girls, Holly Hunter is impressive as Wood's mom while Brady Corbet as her brother and Jeremy Sisto (<span style="font-style:italic;">6 Feet Under</span>, and the title character in USA Network's <span style="font-style:italic;">Julius Caesar</span>) as Hunter's reformed addict boyfriend do what they can. <span style="font-style:italic;">24</span>'s Sarah Clarke (the deadly worm Nina), Cynthia Ettinger (the soon returning <a href="http://www.hbo.com/carnivale/">Carnivale</a>) and DW Moffat have small parts as well.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">moderately recommended</span><br /></p>
