<p>ZapThink <a href="http://www.zapthink.com/report.html?id=ZAPFLASH-12032003">gets nasty</a> on competitor Gartner's <a href="http://www4.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?id=357793&amp;ref=g_search">Four-Platform Framework</a> for Web Services. [<em>via <a href="http://www.netcrucible.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=f10d9439-9d33-4fa0-ac7b-3d6b7b1f332e">BLTS</a></em>]</p>
<p>In footy news, Liverpool FC manager Gerard Houllier is on the hot seat--his head man wants a place in next season's Champions League or else; David Beckham hopes next Summer's marquee signing by his club Real Madrid is Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistlerooy; and, at Beck's old club, the manuevering for control continues as both Glazer and the Irishmen up their stockholdings.</p>
<p>Every columnist I've read so far agrees that the <a href="http://news.mywebpal.com/news_tool_v2.cfm?show=localnews&amp;pnpID=909&amp;NewsID=511068&amp;CategoryID=13281&amp;on=0">BCS is broken</a> and that USC should be playing in the Sugar Bowl.</p>
<p>The Chinese are <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/text/articles/2003/12/09/1070732212177.html">discovering a use</a> for cars well-known in the West. <em>Booya!</em></p>
<p>My vote is for the <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/aptech_story.asp?category=1700&amp;slug=Internet%20Pop%20Up%20Ads">bricks through windows</a> analogy. One significant distinction between most other forms of advertising and spam like this is that other advertising generally pays for something so I don't have to--broadcast TV and (at least cheaper) daily newspapers.</p>
