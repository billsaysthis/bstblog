<p>Okay, maybe there are some people out there who like this slow and boring game. I don't but okay. However, having <a href="http://www.fox.com/24">favorite</a> shows pushed off by local games definitely sucks when the national network is going ahead with <a href="http://www.fox.com/andy">new episodes</a>. I have a Tivo so recording the delayed until midnight showings ought not to be such a problem. But, uh oh, I turn out to be fucked when the game runs six minutes long as happened last night with the Giants and then the moron station execs don't cut short the following shows, like their stoopid local news, to account for this. I wonder if letters to the station really ever do any good:</p>
<p>Bad enough that you would show baseball instead of these shows and then show them late at night. But okay, I can set my recorder (a Tivo in my case) and watch the next day.</p>
<p>But you don't even stick to the damn schedule you list and run the shows late. Oh well, I didn't want to see the end of the shows anyway. Sure I can try and catch 24 later in the week on F/X but that doesn't help my girlfriend, who can't be here then to watch. And it doesn't help with Richter because that show isn't repeated.</p>
<p>Baseball sucks. I realize that's my opinion and someone must watch the games or you wouldn't bother. But if you're going to delay these shows from the rescheduled time, the least you could do is honor the contract you have with viewers (most whom I'm sure are not going to stay up into the middle of the night) and make sure they can be recorded!</p>
<p>I suppose it's too much to ask that you shorten something else, like say your news program, to make up for this so we don't get screwed over next time.</p>
