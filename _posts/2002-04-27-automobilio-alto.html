<p>A tall brown horse clops along, half on the shoulder,<br />
<br />Half on the narrow road in front of a row of tall<br />
<br />Trees. Behind them stand houses and wide green lawns<br />
<br />Drinking in the afternoon sunshine, dimensions sprawling,<br />
<br />Organic fields nearby growing fruits.</p>
<p>The rider wears a tan leather coat over blue jeans and<br />
<br />Black, irridescent boots, curly hair spilling down shoulders,<br />
<br />Smiling as she looks back to her trotting dog. One hundred<br />
<br />chanting pilgrims sit in the field the rider comes abreast of,<br />
<br />lifting their voices to praise the living universe.</p>
<p>My coffee cup is jostled by cracks in the old pavement<br />
<br />As we ride up and down the soft hills surrounded by<br />
<br />Mansions of the wealthy but no hot coffee comes out and over.<br />
<br />Fortunate for me as brown does not go at all well with the<br />
<br />Sky blue shirt I'm wearing, new today.</p>
