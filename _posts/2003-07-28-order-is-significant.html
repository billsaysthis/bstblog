<p>At least when it comes to program code, that is. I realized that as the number of strips in the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/entertain/wfasd.phtml?pg=first">Waiting for a Sunny Day</a> comic grew, there were just too many to load onto a single page and so I wrote some code over the last day to break it up into more manageable chunks. But I kept getting an odd divide by zero error, one that I couldn't track down. Then I realized that I was calling the function giving the error before setting the value of some variables that were used in the calculation. D'oh! On the other hand, I now have a nice bit of well-factored code that can be reused if I re-write the photo gallery classes and make those easier to use as well.</p>
