<p>Let me join the chorus that has certainly already sprung up: the referees, especially the referee's assistant on the far side, Jens Larsen, took the game away from Italy. No problem with either of Croatia's goals, nice touches by both Olic and Rapaic in quick succession, but the two disallowed goals for Italy were both terrible, terrible calls. Especially the diving Vieri header around the 52nd minute, no way was any player from Italy offside. And the strange, dribbling goal well into extra time, disallowed on an alleged foul, when there was no foul to be seen. Italy has every right to be very angry. Hopefully the players will take it out, cleanly, in the game against Mexico Thursday. I have to check some web sites but I wonder if there's rioting on the streets at home.</p>
<p>Italy is considering an <a href="http://worldcup.espnsoccernet.com/story?id=215178&amp;lang=en">official protest to FIFA</a> but apparently there is no chance that the result on the field will be changed. Mexico plays Ecuador tonight in the other Group G second league game and if Mexico, which is a big favorite, takes a win, Italy will need a win against Mexico in the third match or else become another favorite (Argentina, Portugal, France, are you listening?) going home early.</p>
