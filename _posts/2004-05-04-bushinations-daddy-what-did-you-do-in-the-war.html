<p>Author, journalist and Vietnam veteran William Broyles Jr. posted a powerful, insightful essay on today's Times OpEd page: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/04/opinion/04BROY.html?ex=1399003200&amp;en=65282a7f04e7a9dc&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">A War for Us, Fought by Them</a>. I was too young to serve in Vietnam and too old for the first Gulf War, not that I would have volunteered anyway, but I think Broyles' points about the disconnect between our leading politicians and family military service are not just important but also meaningful in policymaking.</p>
