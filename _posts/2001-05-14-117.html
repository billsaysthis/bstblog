<p><b>Monday Roundup: Dylan's Birthday, Startups and Liquid Courage, and The Origins of Madness</b><br />

<p>Greil Marcus has a Special Absurdity of Worldwide Commemoration of Bob Dylan's May 24 60th Birthday Edition! of his <a href="http://salon.com/ent/col/marc/2001/05/14/marcus45/print.html">Real Life Rock Top 10</a> column.</p>
<p>Esther Dyson has posted a recent column <a href="http://www.edventure.com/conversation/article.cfm?Counter=8357524">exploring the current funding situation for startups</a> and is also making her <a href="http://www.edventure.com/conversation/join.cfm">Edventure newsletter</a> available free via email. Esther has been one of the premier technology writers/analysts for a long time, well worth reading.</p>
<p>Feed Magazine has an intriguing article on Dr. David Horrobin's argument that <a href="http://www.feedmag.com/templates/default.php3?a_id=1705">schizophrenia signaled the beginnings of modern man</a>: A genetic mutation changed the biochemistry of fat in our brains. Apparently, his findings are not being well received by other researchers who prefer to see complex pharmaceuticals as necessary to any cure or improvement over dietary changes, which is what Horrobin's research finds satisfactory.</p>
