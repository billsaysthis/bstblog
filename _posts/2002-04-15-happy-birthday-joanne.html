<p>On this day in &lt;deleted by order of the celebrant&gt; <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=mom70&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=bill_jo_mom70_12_00.jpg">my sister Joanne</a> was born in Newark, NJ. Now <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=mom70&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=joanne_dinner_mom70_10_01.jpg">she</a> lives a happy life in Manhattan (New York, not Kansas, oh my god!) and is the publisher of <a href="http://www.secdealer.com/">Security Dealer Magazine</a>. <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=mom70&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=jo_blarneystone_00.jpg">Joanne</a> is wonderful, smart, funny, pretty, and single (does that make a good personals ad?), she's tall, blonde, well-traveled, and doesn't smoke. If you are the right man for her, you will be smart enough to figure out how to get in contact with her without asking me. She is the best sister a guy could ask for except back in high school and college she refused to fix me up with her hottie girlfriends but I forgive her for that now.</p>
