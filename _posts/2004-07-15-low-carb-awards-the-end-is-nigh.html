<p>You know we've slipped past the point of good sense when they start giving out <a href="http://www.carbaware.org/expo/consumer_choice_awards.htm">awards</a>&nbsp;for non-entertainment, non-sports, pure product categories. Oh well. But there are a bunch of resources mentioned that me, Mr. Low Carb Expert, hasn't even heard of, so that's cool at least.<br /></p>
