<p>You'd think Microsoft could get past its own selfish concerns and allow users to install service packs with Firefox and not just IE. Dizzam! Furthermore, I just had a nasty dealing with a big bookseller on eBay, a1books, who are really bumming me out. To put it mildly, for now at least, though I'll probably give the details when all's said and done.</p>
<p>On the bright side: Bruce Springsteen has just announced the details and release date for the 30th anniversary edition of Born to Run. Coming November 15 (which is actually a little late), included are remastered versions of the original songs, a DVD with the entire Hammersmith Odeon, London '75 film of Bruce and the E Streeters legendary 1975 concertin London; the new film <span style="font-style:italic;">Wings For Wheels: The Making of Born To Run</span>; and a 48 page booklet of previously unpublished photographs. With its two DVDs, the package offers approximately four hours of previously unseen footage including three songs recorded live at Los Angeles' Ahmanson Theater in 1973: <span style="font-style:italic;">Spirit In The Night</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Wild Billy's Circus Story</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Thundercrack</span>."</p>
