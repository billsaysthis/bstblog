<p><b>Yesterday's Book: Tell No One</b><br />

<p>Ha! Should be more like Tell Everyone One. The <a href="http://www.harlancoben.com/novels.shtml#TNO">latest mystery novel</a> from Edgar award winner Harlan Coben is a taut thriller unlike his previous novels, which were all great but funny mysteries. This one picks you up by the collar, shakes you around, punches you in the gut a few times. But you live. Here's a good <a href="http://www.bookpage.com/0107bp/harlan_coben.html">recent interview</a> with the author himself. A book absolutely worth buying and reading.</p>
<p>Note: the author is another graduate of Livingston High School, like yours truly.</p>
