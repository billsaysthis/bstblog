<p>I'll just go with the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A48735-2002Feb8.html">article headline</a> for this one, hard to put it better. I kept thinking, "Why is Costas/Couric talking now? I would like to listen to the show." Over and over. How stupid. I was surprised just how touching the Native American and Sting/Yo-Yo Ma performances were and there were some lovely visual touches with the stadium audience, but NBC really blew their coverage. Just hope the event commentators aren't such blabbermouths.</p>
