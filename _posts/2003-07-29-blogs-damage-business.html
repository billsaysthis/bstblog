<p>Rob Fahrni, my favorite Fresno Microsoftie, had a bad experience with a company the other day and wrote it up on his blog (<a href="http://www.crabapples.net/rob/archive/2003_07_27_default.htm#105941282628644608">No integrity</a>). Now that Google and it's dependents are so attuned to blogs, I'm guessing that within a few days or less, people searching on the web for Viking Ready Mix concrete will see Rob's entry as high or higher than the company's own website (if they have one) and think twice about doing business with them. So, Gloria, I'd think twice about bullshitting a bullshitter--just fess up and pay for Rob's damage, that's what your insurance is for. And Rob, I'd file a report with either the Fresno Police or CHP.</p>
