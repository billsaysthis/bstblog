<p>Talk about pulling it out of your ass! That's surely what the American team did tonight in grabbing a point in the match at Panama City, with Cobi Jones scoring the equalizer in the 92nd minute from what was most likely an offside position. The Panamanians' score was completely legit, to be fair. We played like pure crap tonight while the other side had plenty of energy and dominated the second half; other than our goal, we barely troubled Donaldo Gonzalez the entire 48 minutes.</p>
<p>Combined with Jamaica's win at El Salvador, that leaves us in control of our qualifying group at five points, Jamaica ahead of Panama on goal differential, and El Salvador trailing with three points. Pretty much leaves everything up in the air midway through the round, though USA has a slight edge with two home matches and only El Salvador away.<br /></p>
