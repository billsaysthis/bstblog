<p>Continuing <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_03_23_blog_archive.phtml#200057929">the story</a>, with the gender changed to confuse everyone:</p>
<p>X is now completely ignoring the HOA rules and doing whatever she likes, including digging up the flowerbeds outside other people's units and replanting them with what she wants even though what she's doing is potentially harmful (could bring snails and termites). This has brought in complaints and I thought one way to get her to stop her latest antics would be a personal conversation. I walked over to her home, only a few units away from mine, once or twice a day all week but her car was never there.</p>
<p>I finally went over at a time when X was home. This is very funny. As I was walking up her driveway, her patio gate was open and I could see her standing there working on some potted plants. I called out "X" so she wouldn't be startled to see me standing there suddenly and instead of acknowledging me, she ran into her house.</p>
<p>I waited but she didn't come back out. I went around her car and knocked on the door. No answer. Waited a bit and knocked again, still no answer. I walked around the driveway--I decided that just walking through her open gate might be a poor choice--and I could see her living room light on and the patio door open. I called her name a couple more times but she never answered.</p>
<p>Last night was our bi-monthly board meeting. The board decided to take more serious measures to end her bothersome actions.</p>
