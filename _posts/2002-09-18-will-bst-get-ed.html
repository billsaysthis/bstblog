<p>I submitted the CNN article <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2002/09/16/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/index.htm">Nude video games? They're coming this fall.</a> this morning, so we'll see. Keep your fingers crossed. Of course this isn't the same as having an article on this website submitted but could be cool anyway.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> The answer is no, poor Billy got his entry put in the circular bin. Those dastardly /. editors!</p>
