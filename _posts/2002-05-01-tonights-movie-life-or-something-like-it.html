<p>Definitely an excursion into chick flick territory, Angelina Jolie takes a strange ride in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0282687">Life or Something Like It</a> and most men will enjoy the ride as well, even if she doesn't show off her hot naked body. Edward Burns reminds me of someone here, another actor from years past, with the wisecracks and the big smiles, but I can't quite put my finger on who. <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Shalhoub,+Tony">Tony Shalhoub</a> is turning into one of the great character actors of our time (Men in Black, The Man Who Wasn't There, TV's Wings) and his streetcorner prophet sets Jolie off with his vision that she will die in less than a week. Since the first scene is Jolie on an operating table, the odds that she will seem reasonable. Then again, this is a Hollywood movie.</p>
<p>Director Stephen Herek does a much better job this time around than he did on last movie, <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_03_10_blog_archive.phtml#75017572">Rock Star</a>, getting strong performances and keeping the pace flowing. So does writer John Scott Shepherd, whose only previously produced script was last year's Tim Allen clunker Joe Somebody, giving Burns a son as to foil his hard edge.</p>
<p>A big shout out to my homeboy Byron for making the movie and a terrific dinner at <a href="http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/02.05.98/dining-9805.html">Don Giovanni</a> my first birthday present of the year. For those of you still waiting, there are only four more shopping days until the Big Event.</p>
