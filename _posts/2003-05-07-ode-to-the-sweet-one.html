<p>That kiss, that smile, that explosion that<br />
<br />Brilliance cutting through a grey dreary<br />
<br />Afternoon that I thought would never end until<br />
<br />You came unexpectedly to the door and rang.<br />
<br />No television, no novel, no violence-stained<br />
<br />Videogame.</p>
<p>Those lips, those eyelashes, the cheekbones that<br />
<br />Sit at the top of your body and never fail to raise my<br />
<br />Temperature, to quicken the pace of the blood flow<br />
<br />In my veins.</p>
<p>Do you understand this passion? Have I told you<br />
<br />Often enough how much I love you and what that<br />
<br />Means to me?</p>
<p>[Speaking of getting married...]</p>
