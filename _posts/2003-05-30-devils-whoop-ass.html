<p>Two games down, two to go, and the greatest goaltender now playing, the Devils' Martin Brodeur, hasn't even been challenged in putting up two shutouts. JS Giguere came into the Finals as the man with the buzz but he's given up five goals (the Devils' last in Game One was to an empty net) and the New Jersey defense has been absolutely stifling. Props to former SJ Shark Jeff Friesen for getting his scoring touch going, particular the very sweet shot he made tonight.</p>
