<p><b>Morality is in the eye of the beholder</b></p>
<p>To some people, drawing a line between good and bad behavior is very simple. Sometimes it is <a href="http://denbeste.nu/entries/00001108.shtml" title="Thanks Steven">intuitive but wrong</a>. Some behaviors are so wrong, in the eyes of certain groups, it justifies <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml?type=topnews&amp;StoryID=292001">any action</a> to prevent these bad behaviors from happening. Since protests, letter writing campaigns, and even <a href="http://crime.about.com/library/weekly/aa032901a.htm">murder</a> have not gotten anti-abortionists to their goal, one cannot be too surprised that they would attempt to piggyback on current terrorism (since what else can these extemists be termed?) to achieve them. Of course once more they will fail.</p>
