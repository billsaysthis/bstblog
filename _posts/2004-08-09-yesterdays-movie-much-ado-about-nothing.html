<p><a href="http://www.branaghcompendium.com/index2.html">Kenneth Branagh</a> came blasting out of England in the '80s, promising to be the next Olivier. One of the ways he chose to use his new-found clout is to bring versions of all of Shakespeare's works to the screen. From 1993, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107616/">Much Ado About Nothing</a> is one of the comedies and probably one of my favorite movies ever.</p>
<p>Branagh, who wrote adaptation and directed, plays Benedick, a nobleman in the service of Don Pedro (Denzel Washington). Pedro and his men visit Seigneur Leonato, the Governor of Messina, and his family; in his party are his brother John (an evil Keanu Reeves) and Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard), a young, sweet, naive boy who is in love with Leonato's daughter Hero (an enchanting Kate Beckinsale). Benedick is matched with Leonato's niece, Beatrice, played by an amazing Emma Thompson.</p>
<p>The key plots are: Claudio and Hero's love match, which John keeps trying to sabotage and Benedick and Beatrice's pairing, a match that Don Pedro and Leonato conspire to arrange despite the sharp, antagonistic attitudes of the married in real life couple. The characters have complex relationships and with only eight major roles almost all are well developed, Hero and Don Pedro the main exceptions. Michael Keaton, in a minor turn, is a great Dogberry.</p>
<p>Beyond the sophisticated humor and terrific acting, Branagh as director has brought a beautiful, radiant vision of the Italian countryside on screen. Almost as if he had the lighting crew put a second Sun in the sky--which is something one of the digital FX houses might be able to do today but not a dozen years ago.</p>
<p><em>absolutely recommended</em><br /></p>
