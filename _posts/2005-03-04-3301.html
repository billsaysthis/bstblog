<p>Sex Pistols guitarist <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/images.html?issue=13.03&amp;topic=radio&amp;img=2">Steve Jones</a> is now a radio DJ in Los Angeles, supposedly a very cool non-corporate one even though the station is owned by Clear Channel, but what gets me about the linked photo is how normal and middle-aged he looks. You can't be 23 forever but some images create terrible cognitive dissonence nonetheless.</p>
