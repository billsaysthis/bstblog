<p>Angelina Jolie in extremely flattering tight outfits? Check. Whacked out phantasmagorical plot? Check. Diabolical villain racing our heroine to an ancient artifact that could doom millions? Check. Sure enough everything's in place for the 2003 sequel <a href="http://www.tombraidermovie.com/">Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life</a>.</p>
<p>What do you expect from movies based on video games? At least director Jan de Bont keeps the bullets and bombs within reason, a bit of computer generated menace and the visible blood absolutely minimal, a positive in my book. Gerard Butler, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001354/">Ciaran Hinds</a>, and Djimon Hounsou provide romance, evil and wisdom in support.</p>
<p>Yes, nearly everything is cartoony but from that perspective this is successful. A female Indiana Jones, as my sweetie suggested. Not <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325703/business">box office gold</a>, considering the $90 million budget, probably profitable in the long run but Jolie has said she won't do a third.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">moderately recommended</span></p>
