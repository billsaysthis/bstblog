<p>TS1 and I shut off our landline last week. The last real use which required it was TiVo (we had a Series 1) and that went away at the beginning of the year when the HDTV arrived, so we reached out to as many service providers and contacts as we remembered, and friends and family of course, and made sure each had the appropriate cell number, waited a week or so just in case and called ATT to disconnect.</p>
<p>Since we have ATT Wireless, and are new customers to that branch, I didn't get any push back or even difficult questions after giving this reason in response to why. Maybe the trend is so prevalent there wouldn't have been a hard sell to try and retain us no matter the wireless carrier we use. When we switched from Verizon after getting his and hers iPhones that company made a few attempts to retain our business but, of course, there was no chance of that happening.</p>
<p>After having a home phone number for as long as I remember. From when I was born until I was about eight or so our number was 201.992.4583, then that number was transferred to my mom's women's clothing boutique and our number was 201.992.7323 until I moved out of my folks' house permanently after grad school.</p>
<p>My parents got a second line at the house for my sister and me when we were teenagers but oddly I can't remember its number, despite it being the first that was "mine." Then between school and moving houses and states and such I had a bunch that passed too quickly to get lodged permanently in my mind, including the couple I had in California before moving to Mountain View a bit more than 10 years ago. Since then, though, I only had the one home number that just got turned off and my cell, which stayed the same through two or three carrier changes and is what I have now.</p>
<p>Unlike Mr. Scoble, putting that number on this blog is probably not the right choice for me. In case you were wondering.</p>
<p>You might laugh but it feels weird, like leaving my backpack at a hotel and saying forget about it rather than going back. As if something's missing from my jeans pocket that I can't quite put a finger on. Still, better to have the $32/month in my bank account, eh?</p>
