<p><b>Yet another test post: Project Allison</b></p>
<p>Phil Ulrich has posted <a href="http://www.interalia.org/openbox/projectAllison/blogger.newpost.php">Project Allison</a>, another tool to utilize the Blogger API. This one's written in <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a>, which I like, and he's also planning a Visual Basic front end to it, which I really like as I'm in favor of a non-browser based tool to work with my weblog.</p>
<p>[After using] I think the code may have a bug in that I selected post &amp; publish, but this entry was only posted...</p>
