<p>Frank Moss, co-founder of software vendor Bowstreet, writes an article he calls <a href="http://news.com.com/2010-1075-847893.html">Web services' dirty little secret </a> on CNet. Don't believe the big bad vendors like IBM and Microsoft when they say web services are an open, portable platform. Think back to client/server architectures, the last time this more or or less same group of vendors started spouting. But, Moss claims, what they are really doing is giving customers the next generation of platform lock in, a COBOL for the new millenium. He has a solution though: buy his product (although he isn't quite so obvious or the editors are barely this side of bought to come right out and say this) and avoid the lock in. Umm Frank, but doesn't your solution simply lock us in to Bowstreet? Of course he would love that or else his little private company will never escape the dot bomb morass to go public for a bigtime cashout!</p>
