<p>Driving to the gym this morning, one of the radio station blabbermouths mentioned a recent academic study which found that only two percent of all marital affairs stay secret, meaning that 98% become known to the other spouse. Let's call BS on this, assuming the radioman reported the study accurately, because if you'd successfully (and purposely) hidden knowledge of the betrayal from everyone would you really be likely to tell a complete stranger? Even if anonymity was guaranteed why would anyone take the chance?</p>
