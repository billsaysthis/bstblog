<p>The <a href="http://plant.blogger.com/api">Blogger API server</a> continues to be offline, causing this site's Book Review and Springsteen pages to be non-functional at this time. Pyra is not responding to email or <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/bloggerDev/message/650">newsgroup postings</a> on this topic. User frustration is mounting. Myself, I set up <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">MovableType 2.11</a> yesterday and unless there is some serious improvement from Blogger services quickly, you may see me finally give up and leave. Which would be a shame after all this time, well over a year now, that I have been an enthhusiastic user and supporter. Ev, are you listening? Why can't we get so much as a simple status message/response?</p>
<p><em>Update, 5:30 PST:</em> Ev posted a <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/bloggerPro2/message/1268">message to the newsgroup</a> explaining many of the difficulties, including why he hasn't posted answers to the numerous problems. We need to have a chat with some folks at Yahoo! Groups, it seems, when a group owner can't even post to his own group.</p>
<p><em>Update, 6:30 PST:</em> The API server is back online and so all pages should be working.</p>
