<p>Warning: This is a grilled cheese post! Lately my right knee has not been doing so well after visits to the gym. First the doctor said to take a gym vacation, take two Aleve twice a day and put on the occasional ice pack. Did that, went back to the gym and no real change. Went back to the doctor, who sent me to an othopedic specialist. He prescribed a month of physical theraphy plus two Aleve twice a day as long as I'm in therapy.</p>
<p>I went for the first treatment today. Nice place, convenient location. Everybody working there is very young, which is definitely another sign I'm older than I imagine myself to be. First the therapist did some testing and measurement--first time I've seen a protractor used in quite some time--and then sent me off to her aide for stretching.</p>
<p>You wouldn't think stretching could make me feel so creaky, but then you'd be wrong. Since you're all smarter than that, you probably were smirking behind my back, which isn't very nice but that is expected. The aide probably did understand the discomfort without me saying anything since he offered an ice pack after we were done. A big ice pack with my legs elevated, that felt very nice.</p>
<p>The therapist also noticed I have a flat ("pronated") right foot and suggested this is playing a part in my knee's travails. So when I exercise, and I am allowed to go back to the gym, I have to concentrate on keeping the pressure on the outside of my foot. The first part of my stretching for this visit was a five minute warmup on a stationary bike, and I had to constantly remind myself of this, remembering is not easy.</p>
<p>Now I have to do this stretching every day for a month, in addition to the workouts. And find a pair of cheap, yet uncomfortable, orthotics. Swell but as long as I get rid of the knee ache okay.<br /></p>
