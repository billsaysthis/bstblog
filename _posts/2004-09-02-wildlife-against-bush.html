<p>Added a link (over there on the right side bar) to <a href="http://www.defenderbear.org/">Defender Bear</a>, "a cartoon developed by Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund to assist its project to defeat George W. Bush and to elect John Kerry as president of the United States. DefenderBear.org is the Website created to feature the cartoons and related subjects. Defenders Action Fund is working to oppose George Bushâ€™s re-election because it considers him the most anti-conservation U.S. president in history, and because it sees John Kerry as likely to be one of the most pro-conservation presidents in history."<br /></p>
