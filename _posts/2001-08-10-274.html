<p><b>Today's Movie: Once Upon a Time in China</b><br />

<p>If you like pure Hong Kong cinematic martial arts, <a href="http://www.jetli.com/jetli/jet/jet_film_07.php?bw=">Once Upon a Time in China</a> is not to be missed. The video we watched was dubbed in English, which tends to take away from my enjoyment because the voices are so obviously fake and the dialog is so poorly translated. On a DVD I would have had a choice to use subtitles instead but... This is the first of a trilogy where Jet Li plays Wong Fei-hung. Wong is a healer and martial artist in turn of the century China, reacting to the intrusion of Europeans and Americans into China.</p>
