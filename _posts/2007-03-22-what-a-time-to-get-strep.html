<p>So I get this great new job two weeks ago and--boom--Saturday afternoon I start getting sick. Yesterday I was feeling better, went over for a long meeting with the boss, but after dinner things went down hill fast. Coughing, fever, bad sore throat, even chills. Seriously, couldn't the bugs have waited until next month or something?</p>
<p>Don't want to say too much about the new gig yet. We're a very early stage startup, working each on our own, with a really exciting consumer product coming out in the very near future. The co-founders both have impressive track records with previous entrepreneurial ventures and one was an angel investor in RawSugar, which is where the connection came from. My responsibilities are customer support and right now that means helping to build the infrastructure and pumping up the help content. And eating our dog food, as the saying goes, working with our core product every day--it's tasty.</p>
<p>Sure hope the doc's prescription kicks in fast, there aren't enough hours in the day anyway.</p>
