<p>You all know that David Hasselhoff, besides making a huge pile off the lowest common denominator shows Baywatch and Knightrider, is a huge singing star in Europe and <a href="http://www.hellonetwork.com/demo/toysclub/video.asp?speed=hook300">now you can see why</a>. Actually, if you're anything like me, this full-length music video will do no such thing. I have fond memories of the original version from back in the '70s but this is just sad. Almost like <a href="http://holloway.co.nz/butt-face-egg-man.gif">random acts of video</a> cut together as the Buff One spins and spins from desert to ocean to Arctic all the while singing as hard as his lungs will allow. View for laughs only.</p>
<p>Or you can wait a few months and regurgitate your meal after listening to <a href="http://www.cmt.com/news/feat/dparton.040802.jhtml">Dolly Parton sing</a> Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven."</p>
