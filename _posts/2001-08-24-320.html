<p><b>Idiots Suck</b><br />

<p>Another example of how you can find entertainment on the Internet simply by following a few links: <a href="http://www.customerssuck.com/forums/forumdisplay.php3?s=3e95da5eb509337ee5d51effd0e42a95&amp;forumid=79">CS - Stories About Idiots</a>. This site has other forums but this seem the most amusing. It features stories such as the woman who waited 20 minutes in line to return a video to Blockbuster and the clerk who asked a customer to sign the back of a credit card "so she could verify the signatures matched." Classics.</p>
