<p>An Australian film from 1988, <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0095996">Rikky and Pete</a> is a so-so tale of two grown siblings who flee their domineering father and an angry, semi-psychotic copper in Brisbane for the mining works far north in the Outback. The plot's just whacked together, with bits and characters coming in and out without too much reasoning involved, and the sister (<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Landis,%20Nina">Nina Landis</a>) keeps getting up onstage to sing. Overall it has a certain charm but that may just be my general enchantment with all things Aussie.</p>
<p><em>Watchable if nothing else is on the tube</em></p>
