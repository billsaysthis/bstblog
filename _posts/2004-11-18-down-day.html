<p>For the second time in a few months, my precious LittleSteven Toshiba laptop is in the shop. Last time it was the hard drive, this time the screen is dying. Some part called an inverter. Fry's gave me a decent loaner, have to love the newer screens and their sharpness, but the wasted time setting everything up and then transferring data back when LittleSteven comes home is more than annoying. Not to mention that the service counter staffer took over an hour and a quarter to fill in a few forms and get the loaner.<br /></p>
