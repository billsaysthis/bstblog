<p>Another <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2004_11_14_blog_archive.phtml#110080825252134079">down day</a> for my <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2003_07_27_blog_archive.phtml#105962872230782130">not quite two year old</a> Toshiba laptop. Came home from work last night to something that sounded more like poorly-tuned lawnmower than a computer. The Big Guy suggested yesterday's heat might be he culprit so simply leaving the machine powered off for an hour or two was the first remedy to test; sadly, even leaving it off overnight hasn't helped. This is the third system failure in 10 months, making me wonder if LittleSteven has decided to leave the band. It's still under an extended warranty (that was a good decision!) so I'll probably go over to Fry's and see what they say before making a decision. With new Toshiba laptops sporting 17" screens and DVD burners, I'm definitely tempted to bing home a NilsLofgren.</p>
