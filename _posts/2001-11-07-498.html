<p><b>Life size Monopoly comes to San Jose</b></p>
<p>Friends of San Jose Beautiful is bringing a lifesize version of the Parker Brothers game to Guadalupe River Park in San Jose. <a href="http://www.sjbeautiful.org/monopoly_in_the_park.html">Monopoly in the Park</a> will be available for parties and other group use, with properties sponsored by different corporations (IBM purchased New York Avenue, Waste Management bought Community Chest) and organizations (City of San Jos√© Police Department, Police Officers Association purchased "Go to Jail"). There are even jailbird costumes for players to wear while imprisoned. Wired also has a <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,48191,00.html">story</a> on the project. Given the current push of California companies and the state Attorney General against Microsoft in the antitrust case, I find this particularly amusing!</p>
