<p><b>This explain a lot!</b>
<p>I guess I'm one of the SMILTs described in <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/scripts/printer/printer.asp?f=/stories/20010321/508280.html">'We can't believe our luck'</a>: "Single men in their late thirties (SMILTs) have never had it so good: no responsibilities outside work, and a waiting list of twentysomething women who want to date them."</p>
<p><i>Woo-hoo!</i></p>
