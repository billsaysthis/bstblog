<p><strong>Auditors: why do they do these things?</strong></p>
<p>Already, the knives are out and coming after Big 5 accounting firm Andersen, saying the firm's <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml;jsessionid=XV5YLNHI1SWWOCRBAE0CFFAKEEATGIWD?type=businessnews&amp;StoryID=510871">future is at stake</a> after the debacle with Enron. Pundits are claiming that Andersen will be forced to go under or be acquired due to the loss of credibility and the money they will lose in the tidal wave of litigation that has already begun. This isn't the first big problem for them either, as Andersen just paid the largest civil fine ever assessed by the SEC. Another great American company taken down by greed, I suppose.</p>
