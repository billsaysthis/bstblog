<p>Once again a bored writer fell prey to the rants of an aggravated homeowner and <a href="http://aol1.bankrate.com/aol/news/real-estate/HOA-horrors1.asp">published a story</a> on the evils of homeowner associations. One of my fellow MeFites, though he violated the posting guidelines by simply posting a biased phrase as hyperlink text without any additional commentary or explanation (which I find oddly amusing), <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/27797">put it up</a> for discussion on MetaFilter. Given the often (small l) libertarian bent of many commentators, the cries of fascism were not long in coming. Being president of the HOA in which I live, I feel the commentators are generally giving us a bum rap and <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/27797#541802">said so</a>, in detail. To summarize: HOAs are not evil but are also not for everyone.</p>
