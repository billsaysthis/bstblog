<p>An article in this week's <em>Time</em> (<a href="http://www.time.com/time/election2004/article/0,18471,605436,00.html">A Test of Kerry's Faith</a>) points out some contradictions of modern life and especially politics. The article looks at the conflict between John Kerry's professed Catholic beliefs, Catholic Church officials' statements on belief and politics and Kerry's position statements on related issues like abortion and gay marriage.</p>
<p>The Church statements say that Catholic politicians have an obligation, in order to maintain their good standing in the Church, to vote and make every effort to follow Church teachings on these issues. For example, Kerry and other politicians, therefore, must vote against allowing abortions and in favor of making them illegal but Kerry has always voted pro choice. Recently, Church officials have taken their positions to an even more certain level by stating that politicians at any level of government who do not vote in line with the teachings will not be permitted Communion and other graces.</p>
<p>So we come down to the nub. America among those countries with both political freedom and religious variation and so some politicians, just like some number of other citizens, have come to hold positions on issues in conflict with what the leaders of their religion claims is the Godly choice. The Roman Catholic Church is a strong example of this, IMO, because of its extremely hierarchical structure and insistence on Papal infallibility. We Americans claim to have and to support separation of church and state and to leave explicit religious instruction at the doorway of the legislatures and council halls but then turn and see this is far from the truth.</p>
<p>Just another reason why I believe organized religion--especially the true, fanatical believers--is not only a foolish remnant of less-sophisticated, less-educated times but also a hindrance to further social evolution and cultural maturation. I obviously believe Kerry is a far better choice in the November election but one can only wonder how this factor will play out in states where the outcome is still undecided.</p>
