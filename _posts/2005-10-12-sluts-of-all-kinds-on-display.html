<p>My friend Beau recently relocated to San Francisco (from Perth via Maui, ouch!) and based on <a href="http://www.dentedreality.com.au/notes/2005/10/11#quote-of-the-day20051011">a co-worker's remark</a> is now eagerly awaiting his first Halloween in the city. All I can tell you dude is remember what city you're, the movie <span style="font-style:italic;">Crying Game</span>, and watch out for just who you approach ;)</p>
