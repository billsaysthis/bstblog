<p>The Big Guy and my Dad both pointed me to <a href="http://globalspecops.com/vieweyestorm.html">A View from the Eye of the Storm</a>, a&nbsp;speech by Haim Harari, a theoretical physicist,&nbsp;on War on Terror. Lengthy but unlike many essays on the topic, concrete in both examples and required actions. Too bad politicians in the West will not listen to plain spoken truth such as this.<br /></p>
