<p>Based on a novel by comic caper genius Donald Westlake, 1972's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068718/">The Hot Rock</a> was directed by Peter Yates, had a script by William Goldman and starred Robert Redford. Sadly, even with all the talent involved, the film just doesn't measure up to the book. Mainly, I just felt that the cast and director walked through the picture and never approached the nervous energy called for, with the possible exception of George Segal.</p>
<p>Redford's sister is married to Segal, who picks The Blonde One up after his latest stint in jail as we begin. Segal, clearly a criminal wannabe, has a job for them: stealing the Sahara Stone, treasured by several African nations and currently on display in Manhattan, for the UN Ambassador (Moses Gunn) of one of the interested nations. Reluctantly, Redford agrees to the job and Segal rounds out the crew with Paul Sand and Ron Leibman. The heist goes reasonably well but Sand, who has the gem, is caught by the cops. The crew spins around a batch of bad luck ever more tightly; Sand's father (Zero Mostel) even tries to rip them off.</p>
