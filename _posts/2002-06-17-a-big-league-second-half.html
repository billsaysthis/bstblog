<p>More yellows, they just keep coming. A strange one against Brad Friedel that was simply a mistake by the referee. Who made a huge one early in the second half when John O'Brien got away with a handball in the box.</p>
<p>Friedel has played up to the top flight level he's shown throughout the tournament. He had no business at all in the first half, essentially, but had to be at his best for the entire second half.</p>
<p>Mexico takes a red card to Marquez with an elbow against Cobi Jones in the 88th minute. They'll be down a man for the remainder and they've used all their substitutes too. Jones drew a yellow card a few minutes earlier too.</p>
<p>Only the 89th minute but Sam's Army is singing Na Na Hey Hey (Goodbye) already. Five minutes of stoppage time to go!</p>
<p>94th minute and Donovan almost makes it 3-0 off a Jones cross but the ball sails over the top. The Americans have never put on a shutout in the World Cup before today.</p>
<p>Is this the most exciting win for US Men's soccer ever? You bet it is! Two quality goals, nothing cheap or easy about either, against a quality team. The US makes it into the Round of Eight. Bring on Germany!!!</p>
<p><span style="font-size:400%;font-weight:bold;">USA! USA!</span></p>
