<p>Of <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/archives/000238.shtml#000238">Karl's hinting</a>, that is. I will be checking out this website tomorrow: <a href="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/smc/journey/">the Hero's Journey</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks buddy! But you haven't told us how much you enjoyed the Phoenix Trap show yet! Of course, neither has <a href="http://www.phoenixtrap.com/~mjg/index.php">Mark</a>. Maybe the show was so good they're both still spinning?</p>
