<p>Spitzer, New York's crusading <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/bio.html">attorney general</a>, has written an outstanding essay for today's NY Times OpEd page, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/17/opinion/17SPIT.html">Regulation Begins at Home</a>, in which he tears a nice chunk out of the Bush Administration. Specifically he attacks the SEC's settlement with Putnam over their misadventures in mutual funds and the administration's decision to abandon pending enforcement actions and investigations of Clear Air Act violations. This guy is 44 years old, Princeton undergrad, Harvard Law (married to another Harvard Law grad), and clearly one of the brightest future stars of the Democratic Party if he can sustain the momentum--I absolutely look forward to seeing him take a bigger seat down the road and would recommend he be considered for Attorney General should (when) the Demos unseat Bush next year.</p>
