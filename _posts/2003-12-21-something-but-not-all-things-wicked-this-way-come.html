<p>I suppose we should all behave properly, all the time, but being human none of us are quite so perfect. Which is one reason why the GPS-based tracking technology described in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/21/technology/21WATC.html?th">this NY Times article</a> is giving me the creeps. I can surely understand a parent's concern for a child in this age of violence or terror but, bringing in a commonly used phrase from journalism, this is a slippery slope we're traveling down and slipping into the danger zone is going to be all too easy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tom Friedman is really stretching to make a point with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/21/opinion/21FRIE.html">his column</a>. I do not in the least see the big deal in requiring foriegners to provide their fingerprints before entering America; we need to be sure the person is who he or she claims to be and if that's unacceptable, the person really doesn't need to come in.</p>
