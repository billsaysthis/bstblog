<p><strong>Paces, routes, Fates</strong></p>
<p>[In lieu of some more prosaic thoughts on the turn of the year, I offer this poem]</p>
<p>Take in the breath of life around you<br />
<br />Feel the joy and challenge and sadness<br />
<br />Is it cold and crisp or hot and wet?<br />
<br />Hammer or feather, what is your choice?</p>
<p>Or do we have a choice to make?<br />
<br />The Fates lay claim to that right<br />
<br />To measure the paces and map the routes<br />
<br />Each day, each minute turns a new page.</p>
<p>A deep pit where gleaming towers once stood<br />
<br />Say otherwise as the children and widows cry<br />
<br />To Hell with the Fates and their plans made real<br />
<br />Away with the heart, dig deep with knives.</p>
<p>Other folk stand up, ready to be counted<br />
<br />Ready to make some difference if they can<br />
<br />Barriers to the goal must be swept away<br />
<br />If these burning hearts can be made true</p>
<p>Fates take a seat, listen to the cries of Men<br />
<br />Watch for the blooming flowers in the crisp Winter<br />
<br />Feel the trees sway in the heat of Summer<br />
<br />Waiting to feel again the winged energy of delight.</p>
<p>Inspired by rainer marie rilke's as once the winged energy of delight [via <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/posts/02/20020101">dangerousmeta</a>]</p>
