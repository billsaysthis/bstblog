<p>Weblogs Compendium put together <a href="http://www.lights.com/weblogs/rss.html">this list of RSS Readers</a>. Clearly goes to show that when you put hype together with a fairly easy technical situation, you get people jumping in massively, seeking <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.07/egoboo.html">egoboo</a> since there is little or no opportunity for actual cash money. Can't complain since (a) I use a <a href="http://www.sharpreader.net/">very nice free reader</a> and (b) I know there are some people reading this blog through them. But still people, aren't there other interesting problems you can solve with your software expertise?</p>
