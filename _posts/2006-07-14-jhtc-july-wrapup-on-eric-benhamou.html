<p>I think <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/misc/jhtc-july06.html">tonight's meeting</a> showed JHTC is starting to get back to the level of community we had in 2003-2004. A terrific speaker in Eric Benhamou, 50+ people in the room and lots of small group conversations before and after the main event.</p>
<p><a href="http://web.benhamouglobalventures.com/">Eric</a> gave an energizing hour long presentation title "Business for the Soul," discussing the role of social action for corporations and how that translates into venture philosophy, using as a case study the terrific success <a href="http://israelventurenetwork.org">the Israel Venture Network</a>, which he chairs, has had in six short years. He then took questions from the group for 25 minutes.</p>
<p>As I announced at the beginning of the meeting, our next two meetings are already set:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/misc/jhtc-sep06.html">Sep. 12</a> - <a href="http://www.rawsugar.com/">Ofer Ben-Shachar</a>, A Pragmatic Serial Entrepreneur</li>
<li>Nov. 14 - Barry Kramer and Candy Mirrer, Venture Capital and M&amp;A for Startups</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks again to <a href="http://www.fenwick.com">Fenwick &amp; West</a> for the use of their great conference space!</p>
<p>Here are a couple of photos, one of Eric and one with him and me:</p>
