<p>Come back to me!<br />
<br />I'm proud of my big fat ass<br />
<br />It was a great pleasure to be naked in [the] film<br />
<br />You knew the broadcast would be watched by millions<br />
<br />of families with children--now you owe me billions.</p>
<p>Valentine's Day is coming up, and each of us is thinking<br />
<br />of romance--and you could give me a jolly good rogering--<br />
<br />No more trolling the Internet for juicy tales please,<br />
<br />We're talking about young kids, who don't even really know<br />
<br />The pressure yet.</p>
<p>I listen to voices, snap my fingers and I  love the way music<br />
<br />Makes me feel--I do, I truly do--the message is, get up and dance!<br />
<br />Just do it! My head is just something I keep my hat on.</p>
<p>Don't ask for my family's darkest secret, how my older<br />
<br />Brother threatened to kill him, beat him to a pulp, stomp!<br />
<br />That fool tried to get between him and his ex-wife. No<br />
<br />Denying, as it was all caught on camera and then<br />
<br />He disappeared down Flamingo Lane.</p>
<p>Yobbos and hooligans, pardon me for living, but there was a time<br />
<br />A time when buying soap was enough, and now there's a hold up.<br />
<br />I thought he was a student, he was taking heroin and grabbing<br />
<br />Condoms--he should not have been out in the street--and there<br />
<br />He was, shouting, "I'm proud of my big fat ass" to all and anon.</p>
