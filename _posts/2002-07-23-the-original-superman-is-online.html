<p>Not sure how long this scanned in copy (<a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG02/yeung/actioncomics/cover.html">ACTION COMICS NO. 1</a>) will be allowed to stay online by the copyright owner. To me, it's only of historical interest, even though I'm a Superman fan, because the actual comic is pretty pitiful. Somewhere along the line later the beginning was redone and became much more interesting.</p>
