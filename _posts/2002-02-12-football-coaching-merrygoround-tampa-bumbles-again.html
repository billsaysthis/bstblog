<p>One would think at this point the Glazer boys down in Florida would learn to keep their movements, meetings, and mouths shut unless they have something good to say. Maryland coach Ralph Friedgen might not be a bad choice for their head coaching slot, he is hot and has solid offensive-side credentials, but he <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2002/0211/1330324.html">decided to stay at Maryland</a>. I suppose the press conference Friedgen held to announce this would have let the cat out of the bag anyway, but one must think that this whole tryst could have been kept under wraps, at least for the time being, if some effort had been made. The previous candidate, Marvin Lewis, got a nice consolation prize: the biggest contract ever for an assistant coach to be the Redskins' defensive coordinator. Someday, Marvin, someday, you'll get that head coaching gig you deserve and have a chance to show all the owners and GMs what they passed up these last few years.</p>
