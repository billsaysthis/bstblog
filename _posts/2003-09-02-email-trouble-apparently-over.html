<p>There were about 200 new emails in my mail client when I checked first thing this morning, so that's good. Although 120 were spam, which was less good. I have never and will never buy anything or visit any website which brings itself to my attention through spam, so these people are wasting their own time and resources keeping me in the loop. Oh well, another one came in as I was writing this. Still, my point is that you can send email again to my normal address.</p>
