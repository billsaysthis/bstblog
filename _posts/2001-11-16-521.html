<p><b>Advertising (by me) for the laughs</b></p>
<p>A new <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/textads.mefi">trend</a> in web advertising, after so many other forms--banners, popups, pounders--have clearly failed, is being called micro advertising. Pyra Labs, the company behind Blogger (the service that I use to publish this weblog), today debuted <a href="http://www.pyrads.com/index.jsp">the Pyrads service</a> and I figured for $10 for 3,333 views I'd try it out; I expect I was one of the first since I have RAD Order ID #104 (whoohoo!). You can see the results in <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/galleries/odds_ends.phtml?pic=bloggerad_1.jpg">this screen capture</a>. Yes, I had to use up one of the views to get the shot but since the ads rotate, it was the only way I could see it myself. In the first few hours (no more than four, since that's how long ago I bought the add), I had 11 hits (out of 276 impressions delivered) from it, so that's cool. If you're reading this page after clicking through on the ad, please <a href="mailto:bill@billsaysthis.com">drop me an email</a> and let me know what you think.</p>
<p>About the ad itself. The title is limited to 20 characters and the text to 50, so I wrote: title - BillSaysThis is fun! and text - Wandering comments on the real and online worlds</p>
<p>Okay, not going to overthrow Madison Ave. anytime soon, still a cheap thrill.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> In response to an email from <a href="http://www.dotcomnotcom.com/index2.html">Alex Rose</a> (thanks!), I checked the referrer logs to see that after about 23 hours Blogger/Pyrad delivered 992 impressions of my ad and 29 people clicked through to see this site. Three percent may not sound like much but it's much higher than the average banner ad gets. And I still get over 2300 more impressions delivered!</p>
