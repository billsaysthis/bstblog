<p>English keeper David Seaman makes a great jumping save to shut down a Brazilian offesnive push but he comes down over the top of Sol Campbell and has big trouble getting up. The England trainer comes up and works his lower back before play resumes; that was probably two+ minutes of extra time right there. England is now keeping six men back as a line to make sure they go in at the half with the lead.</p>
