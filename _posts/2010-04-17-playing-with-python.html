<p>As part of the Events team at <a href="http://hackerdojo.com">Hacker Dojo</a> (where I'm more or less happily spending most weekdays now), I'm helping to write a new events application. <a href="http://progrium.com/">Jeff Lindsay</a> started the app before any of the rest of us got involved and he chose to write in Python for deployment on Google App Engine.</p>
<p>Never having worked with Python before (<em>eww, indentation denotes code sections</em>) has been a bit of a challenge. But the app is straightforward in functionality and I can often copy Jeff's original code as a starting point. Also there are a bunch of Python devs here at the Dojo who I've bugged for help.</p>
<p>Can't say as I'm inspired to jump ship from Ruby on Rails, at least not yet, but learning a new language appeals to me.</p>
