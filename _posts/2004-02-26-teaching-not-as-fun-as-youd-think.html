<p>I was the co-facilitator at a ProMatch class today, my first time, and although I had very positive feedback for the portion of the class where I pretended to teach, it was not as pleasant an experience as, say, sitting in the stands at an Earthquakes match. For those of you know me and my aversion to sitting in the same building as thousands of other humans should realize that I choose this comparison intentionally.</p>
<p>To a degree, I walked into this because originally the facilitator had no plans to turn over a segment of the class to me and was only going to use me as scribe. But during the break I gave him some 'constructive feedback' (which he did request from the class just before the recess) and possibly he was not 100% thrilled with this. At least, he immediately afterwards made the change in plans.</p>
<p>Stage fright is a terrible thing and some people get it so bad there's no chance of them standing in front of a class but my level is much milder. Mainly I seem to speak to the class but inside am wondering what I'll say next or who I should call on when I've finished the sentence; an odd sort of multi-tasking, with some internal anxiety-driven shaking thrown in. Next Tuesday I get the pleasure all over again though with a different class.</p>
