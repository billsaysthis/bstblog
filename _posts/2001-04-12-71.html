<p><b>Space is beautiful, man</b>
<p>Remember those days back in college when you could spend Friday night with something to give you a buzz, a blacklight, and a cool poster? Well, that was "20 years ago today," as <a href="http://www.thebeatles.com">the Beatles</a> said. But you can get a natural high looking at <a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/public/gallery/galindex.html">images from the Hubble Telescope</a>, such as this one of the <a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/public/2001apr/big.html">Whirlpool Galaxy M51</a>. Groovy, dude.</p>
