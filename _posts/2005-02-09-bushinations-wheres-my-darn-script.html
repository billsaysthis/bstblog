<p>Matt Drudge <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/flashss.htm">quoted President Bush's brief conversation</a> with Mary Mornin in Omaha today (<a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=/www/story/02-04-2005/0002951038&amp;EDATE=">PR Newswire transcript</a>). Mornin, a woman in her late fifties who told the president she was a divorced mother of three, including a 'mentally challenged' son. Just in case it goes away here is what I read:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><tt><b>"Begin transcript:</p>
<p>MS. MORNIN: That's good, because I work three jobs and I feel like I contribute.</p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT: You work three jobs?</p>
<p>MS. MORNIN: Three jobs, yes.</p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT: Uniquely American, isn't it? I mean, that is fantastic that you're doing that. (Applause.) Get any sleep? (Laughter.)</p>
<p>MS. MORNIN: Not much. Not much.</b></tt><tt><b>"</b></tt></p></blockquote>
<p>I don't but perhaps you find this funny; all I see from this is an enormous lack of sensitivity on the part of a man who seems lost in the ether when he doesn't have prepared remarks to lean on if an off-message question comes his way. This woman is struggling to make ends meet yet finds the time to attend a rally supporting his (full of crap) Social Security reform proposal and the BushMeister falls back on his fratboy mean humor to thank her. <span style="font-style:italic;">Wonderful!</span><br /></p>
