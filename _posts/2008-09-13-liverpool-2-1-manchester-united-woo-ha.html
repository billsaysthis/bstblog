<p>Because of the Setanta crap this game wasn't available to the vast majority of American fans but I was quite happy to read this headline on BBC Sports just now:</p>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/7614366.stm">Ferguson lambasts Man Utd display</a></p>
<p>Lovely words for any Reds fan, eh? Especially with Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres starting on the bench from injury, our captain only coming on at the 68th minute, and the Red Devils' five years of league dominance continuing with a smart early goal by Tevez off a brilliant pass by newly bought Dimitar Berbetov, one would hardly have expected <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7601885.stm">the result</a>.</p>
<p>10 points off our first four Premier League matches has us at the top of the table (pending Chelsea's outcome in a couple of hours) and Man Utd only four off three matches. We have an interesting run of five games, probably mostly winnable: at Marseilles for the opening Champions League game midweek, new boys Stoke City--who are beating Newcastle 0-2 after 70 minutes today--next Saturday, a Carling up tie with League One side Crewe, the 'away' derby with Everton and finally yet another CL clash with Dutch power PSV Eindhoven.</p>
<p>Is this the year the title drought ends? Sir Alex and his teams have taken 10 league title in that time to climb within one of Liverpool's all-time record but one can only hope today's hard working result foretells just that ending!</p>
