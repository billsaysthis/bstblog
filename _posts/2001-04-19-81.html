<p><b>Picturing pennies</b>
<p>For some reason, Alan Taylor has published <a href="http://www.kokogiak.com/megapenny/">the MegaPenny Project</a>. The project purports to visualize what various numbers of pennies, stacked, would look like. Doesn't really work for me, but it may for you. Does this look like a <a href="http://www.kokogiak.com/megapenny/nine.asp">billion pennies</a>?</p>
