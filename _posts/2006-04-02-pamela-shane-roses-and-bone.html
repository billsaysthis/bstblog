<p>My good friend <a href="http://www.pamslife.com">Pam</a> has finally released her first CD through CD Baby, <a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/pamelashane">Roses and Bone</a>, and I can tell you that if you enjoy heartfelt, emotional singer-songwriters like Shawn Colvin or Stephen Bishop you'll probably enjoy Pam's music. Since Pam plays piano that's the featured instrument rather than guitar, though she does have pedal steel support from <a href="http://www.rearwindowmusic.com/bobby_index.html">Bobby Black</a> (Commander Cody, Asleep at the Wheel, New Riders of the Purple Sage). You can <a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/pamelashane">listen to the songs online</a> and the $12.95 is money well spent. She was back in the studio this afternoon to kickstart her next recording.</p>
