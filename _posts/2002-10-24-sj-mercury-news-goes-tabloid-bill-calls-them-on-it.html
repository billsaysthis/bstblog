<p>As <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_10_13_blog_archive.phtml#85579929">mentioned here</a> last Saturday, I wrote a very cranky Letter to the Editor regarding a <a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/4320908.htm">silly article</a> the newspaper put on their front page that day. But give them credit, they <a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/opinion/4356774.htm">printed my letter</a> today, directly above a similarly criticial letter from Gov. Davis's press secretary Steven Maviglio.</p>
<p>Or, as one friend put it, the editors are seriously cynical and realize that printing such letters keeps people reading. And buying the newspaper. So they purposely write articles that will attract emotional responses because the sell more product. I believe this is what they mean by sensationalism and <a href="http://www.nypost.com/">tabloid journalism</a>. The Merc isn't that low. Yet.</p>
