<p>NBC can really suck my ass. I mean it. Bad enough they moved <em>Boomtown</em> from Sunday to Friday but for them to now put the series on hiatus for (at least) three weeks due to low ratings after only two showings this season is sad. Perhaps it's for the best, sort of a mercy killing, since the network already forced creators Jon Avnet and Graham Yost to stop using the Rashomon-like multiple perspectives that gave <em>Boomtown</em> its distinctive flavor.</p>
