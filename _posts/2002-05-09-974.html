<p><strong>The last part of a cold</strong>, at least for me, is the weird part where I am woozy for a number of hours and there is no difference if I lie die and watch TV, sit up and read, or walk around. Of course running in tight little circles or pretending to be a figure skater by spinning in place makes the feeling worse.</p>
