<p><strong>Vaxgen: more good news</strong></p>
<p>The company furthest along in releasing an AIDS vaccine has released more good news: the HIV/AIDS vaccine, AIDSVAX B/B, <a href="http://ir.shareholder.com/vxgn/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=68699">induces antibodies to the five most common HIV subtypes</a> according to an article published today in the journal Vaccine. "Once again we see evidence that AIDSVAX induces a more robust immune response than we originally anticipated," said Donald P. Francis, M.D., D.Sc., president and co-founder of VaxGen. The stock is up 30 cents on the report. Now if they could just get some analyst coverage to bring in the insitutional investors.</p>
