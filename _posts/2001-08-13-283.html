<p><b>Need a Sopranos fix?</b><br />

<p>Yeah, I know HBO began showing the <a href="http://www.hbo.com/sopranos">first 39 episodes</a> last night. But I've seen all of them at least three times (except for the third season) and I can't believe we'll be waiting another <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/2001_07_15_blog_archive.phtml#4584386">13 months for new shows</a>. Our good friends at Democratic Underground are trying to help fill the void with <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/supremos/index.html">The Supremos, by The Shifties</a>. Tony's family is replaced by the <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">US Supreme Court</a>, with Antonin 'Nino' Supremo (i.e., Antonin Scalia) as head of the family and Chief Justice Rehquist as the proxy for Uncle Junior. Nino also consults with his attractive brunette psychiatrist Dr. Phlemmi, of course. Good for some laughs.</p>
<p>What is the Democratic Underground? It "was founded on Inauguration Day, January 20, 2001, to protest the illegitimate presidency of George W. Bush and to provide a resource for the exchange and dissemination of liberal and progressive ideas. Since then, DU has become one of the premier left-wing websites on the Internet, publishing original content six days a week, and hosting one of the Web's most active left-wing discussion boards."</p>
<p>Another amusing feature on the site is <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/top10/top10_2001_31.html">The Top Ten Conservative Idiots</a>, a list that is posted weekly.</p>
