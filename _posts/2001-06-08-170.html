<p><b>Microsoft plays Big Bad Wolf Once Again</b><br />

<p>Are the <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com" title="How can you not read this regularly?">web pages you read</a> not heavily <a href="http://www.scripting.com" title="Random link for your amusement">linked enough?</a> As part of Windows XP (coming in October), the Evil Redmondians may solve this problem with Internet Smart Tags. Deborah Branscom has a <a href="http://buzz.weblogs.com/2001/06/08">properly snarky response</a> in her weblog. Walt Mossberg has more details in a <a href="http://interactive.wsj.com/fr/emailthis/retrieve.cgi?id=SB991961636462948689.djm">Wall Street Journal article</a>, including a brief yet wimpy MS defense. So far the tags are in an XP beta but per MS no decision has been taken on whether they will be included in the commercial release.</p>
<p>What are Smart Tags? According to The Wall Street Journal, Smart Tags "automatically scans the Web pages that a Windows XP user browses, inserting links beneath certain types of words, such as names of the companies, sports teams or colleges." <a href="http://www.fool.com/news/2001/msft010608.htm">Motley Fool</a> says "If you think this sounds an awful lot like a hyperlink -- one of those underlined blue words on a website that takes the user to another webpage -- you're right, except that whereas a webpage designer controls a hyperlink, Microsoft will control Smart Tags." For a technical look at creating Smart Tags, you can check out this <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/voices/office06072001.asp">MS Developer Network article</a>.</p>
<p>The Register has <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/19573.html">further XP bad news</a> in an overview of the latest beta release.</p>
