<p>For example, Canadian power trio <a href="http://www.rush.com/">Rush</a>. Their latest release, Vapors, is consistent with the body of work they've made over the last 28 years (Rush, 1974, and Fly By Night, 1975), rocks as hard as ever but doesn't stagnate. Neil, Alex, and Geddy have always been techies and so it's no surprise they have a pretty sophisticated website all done in Flash. Given that their days of huge album sales are over, the group is using the site to collaborate with fans--homemade videos, fan record reviews, and more--and not just <a href="http://brucespringsteen.net/" title="Okay, I'm grousing but he could do a lot better!">minimal material related to a new release</a>. When I clicked on the '70s Photo Gallery, <em>Closer to the Heart</em> just started playing (and no annoying RealPlayer or WMP popping up either). One quible: Shoreline Amphitheater is in Mountain View, not San Francisco! [<em>via <a href="http://philsown.com/blog/">Phil's Own</a></em></p>
