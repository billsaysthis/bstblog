<p><strong>Tonight's movie: Ocean's 11</strong></p>
<p>I had been reluctant to see <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0240772">this remake</a> of a less-than-classic 1960 Sinatra film once I read the reviews. But I got a good review from <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/gallery.phtml?gall=mom70&amp;pg=pic&amp;pict=joanne_dinner_mom70_10_01.jpg">my sister</a> and there was <a href="http://us.imdb.com/tiger_redirect?PROMO_HPVAN&amp;/Title?0259711">nothing else</a> that seemed interesting so off we went. My sister was right and we enjoyed this film. Although director Steven Soderbergh would have been better off without the useless coda; I guess he felt the need to show Julia Roberts and George Clooney kissing. Why was Don Cheadle speaking with a Cockney accent? Casey Affleck and Scott Caan nearly steal the movie as a pair of bumbling brothers who take on almost all the crucial supporting tasks. <a href="http://us.imdb.com/EGallery?source=ss&amp;group=0240772&amp;photo=Kit7.jpg&amp;path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Reiner,+Carl">Carl Reiner</a>, still great at age 79, shows superb timing and delivery. Still, the point of the original was to give the Rat Pack a chance to work together and this crew doesn't quite match the cohesion and chemistry, even if this film is better made. Recommended if you want to come out feeling good.</p>
