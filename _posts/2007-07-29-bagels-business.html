<p>The <a href="http://jvalley.org/">Jewish Federation of Silicon Valley</a> asked me to be on the organizing committee for a new speaker's series, due to our burgeoning relationship over the <a href="http://jhtc.org/">Jewish High Tech Community</a>, and, flattered, I agreed. The new Federation leadership (which I'm seeing in dealings with Jyl Jurman and Arielle Hendler) are showing real smarts IMO, especially compared with the previous team who, after all, took over JHTC and let it die on the vine.</p>
<p>Bagels + Business will have a wider focus than JHTC, bringing in speakers from across the spectrum of industries we have here in the South Bay like real estate, biotech/pharmaceutical, finance and investing, media and sometimes stretching the boundary a bit into politics and education. I signed up to help arrange the April guest which, given the timing, will focus on business in Israel as our homeland reaches its 60th birthday.</p>
<p>Details are still being worked out but this is planned to be held five times a year, preferrably the second Thursday of every other month beginning in October, at the beautiful new <span class="style141"><a href="http://www.svjcc.org/">Addison-Penzak Jewish Community Center</a> in Los Gatos,</span> with a small admission to cover the cost of breakfast. We're hoping to have a real blockbuster speaker for the first event but I should probably hold my tongue until arrangements are final ;)</p>
<p>As you'd expect, these events will be open to the community at large, Jewish or not. And I'm easily flattered.</p>
