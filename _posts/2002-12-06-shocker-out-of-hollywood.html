<p>Well, not really. A press release came out this morning announcing that <a href="http://www.julia-stiles.com/">Julia Stiles</a> has made a deal to star in a romantic comedy called <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0337697">The Prince and the Freshman</a>. She'll play the rebellious farmgirl frosh at college in Indiana where a British prince is studying and spending a year out of the limelight. They fall in love, the news gets out, and the Queen must clean up the mess. I'll give you one, and only one, guess as to the ending of this film.</p>
<p>No word on who's playing the prince just yet; maybe they'll get Naomi Watts' boyfriend Heath Ledger. I thought <a href="http://movies.hsx.com/servlet/SecurityDetail?symbol=JSTIL">Stiles</a> was trying to step up in class with her small role in <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2002_06_09_blog_archive.phtml#85171977">The Bourne Identity</a> and co-starring in the upcoming Julia Roberts film <a href="http://movies.hsx.com/servlet/SecurityDetail?symbol=MNLSA">Mona Lisa Smile</a> but apparently money talks. Can't really blame her for that.</p>
