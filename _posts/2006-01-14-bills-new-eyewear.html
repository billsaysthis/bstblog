<p>I've been wearing contact lenses for about seven months now, probably my fourth or fifth try over the years beginning in high school. Each previous time I had an allergic reaction on the inside of my eyelidsâ€”nothing serious, little bumps just uncomfortable enough to make me go back to glasses.  Knock on wood but I'm finally confident that the material used in Bausch &amp; Lomb's brand new as of last Fall <a href="http://www.bausch.com/us/vision/products/softcontacts/purevision.jsp">Pure Vision line</a> won't cause the same problem.</p>
<p>Wearing them isn't a matter of vanity for me (I don't think) but better vision and convenience. Having to clean them overnight once a week offers a good comparison on sight quality, each pair lasts for at least a month and, for example, wearing them out in the rain is an entirely difference. Though they're not perfect as the allergy is still troubling me a bit and producing excessive amounts of... um... eye goo all day long.</p>
<p>Big thanks to my opthamologist, <a href="http://www.mvo.com/doctors.asp?ID=5">Dr. Ken Schwaderer</a>, for taking terrific care of me, trying different lenses and approaches over quite a few appointments to get the right solution. Definitely consider <a href="http://www.mvo.com/">Mountain View Optometry</a> if you're in the area and need a new doctor, nothing in  it for me but do tell them I referred you.</p>
