<p>Let's see. The weigh-in. Breakfast, cheese omelette, couple slices bacon, couple slices low-carb toast, green tea, courtesy of the Sweet One. Read the paper, read the overnight email. Took TS1 to her train. Back home, surfed the news list, more email, shower. Coffee with Evan. Conversation: raid level zero, Andreeson's ReplayTV setup, wedding preparation, Niacin. Home again, more surfing.</p>
<p>Guy from the carpet store, the sales manager, showed up. The bedroom door doesn't stay open since the new carpet was installed. He tries to fix it. Nothing obviously wrong. Ten minutes, 20 minutes, nearly an hour. Finally Sean wants to give up. I'm not satisfied, and, see, they need to do something because I still have the second half of their payment in hand. He promises to send one of his handymen on Monday and I say fine. This is accompanied by much dialog on his part trying to get me to agree that this is not their problem anymore, but I do not. He's almost out the door and then decides to try one more thing--stuffing little bits of paper into the hinges.</p>
<p>Ta-da! The paper, along with tiny bits of masking tape, do the trick. No need for the handyman to come. Door stays open yet still closes when pulled. Sean leaves, glad to escape. I agree to call tomorrow and pay. Well after noon now, I am hungry. Delicious leftover fried chicken from last night, courtesy of TS1. I eat it, along with a Chocolate Peanut Butter Atkins Advantage Bar. Nummy! Watch this morning's episode of <i>Lois and Clark: the Adventures of Superman</i>--Tivo is great. This was the episode where Lois tries to respond to Clark's proposal. Cool shot of Superman flying her up over the clouds. When she complains about being a bit chilly, he warms her by wrapping the cape around her. As if she wouldn't freeze and choke to death for lack of oxygen at that altitude! LOL</p>
<p>More email. I send a resume to a recruiter in New Jersey who posted a couple of interesting jobs to KITlist-tech. Later he posts a few more and now they include the requirement that the candidate be local, no relocation available. I'll be getting that phone call tomorrow, right? Take out a bag of catfish to defrost for dinner.</p>
<p>Time to roll. First stop is the party supply store on El Camino but they do not carry calligraphy pens any more. Odd. I go to Long's, across the street, to mail Annie's birthday gift to her in Hungary. Something nice, to be sure. While there, I check and sure enough, Long's carries calligraphy pens. $6.59 for a pack of five but of course that includes several colors I have no need for. They do not sell single black pens. No matter, I buy the pack. Starbucks alert--it's right there across the parking lot. Must have more coffee! Fortunately, their supply has not run out and they sell me a grande for only $1.55. Hey, it's hot and it's coffee.</p>
<p>Next stop Safeway. Got to love a supermarket that always has a two for one special on an 18 pack of fresh eggs, given that we eat so many on the Atkins Nutritional Approach. Probably around 30 a week between the two if us. Plus some bok choy for dinner. Before this diet began I don't think I'd ever eaten bok choy but now probably once a week. It's good, you should try it, either steamed with a little salt in the water or sauteed with some minced garlic. The cashier must have just come on shift, she is all bubbly and energetic.</p>
<p>Home again, garbage has been collected from the curb but mail is in the box. Nothing interesting or useful. As if I have the excess cash flow to send to (certainly deserving) groups these days! Instead I whip up a batch of Atkins Blueberry Muffins. A little bit of elbow grease (and vegetable oil) and we have a dozen muffins, enough for about a week of breakfasts. Since I'm in a surprisingly good mood--must be the coffee--I wash the dishes too.</p>
<p>More websurfing. For some reason I did not make the Daypop Top 40 for the, let's see, 720th straight day. Glenn Reynolds or Dave Winer I am not. But I play one of them in this surreal dream that garret has every once in a blue moon. Karl enjoys an article I send on Line 6. Mom calls to talk about the hotel situation in Mountain View. The President comes on the TV and tries to hypnotize the White House press corp but as best I can tell they resist successfully. I do my wrist weight work while watching, to avoid the hypnosis.</p>
<p>Finally TS1 come home from work and I get the hug that is so urgently needed. Phew! She admires the calligraphy pens and starts to play with one, writing my parents' names over and over on a blank sheet of paper. She has much better penmanship than she realizes. The invitations look great, I made them the other day at Evan's place. Are you coming? Then I smell dinner cooking, courtesy of TS1, fried catfish, the last few shrimp, steamed bok choy. First time we are having catfish but I like it. Fish is another thing I never ate before the diet but just goes to show what a well-meaning person can miss without even trying. Afterwards, I watch this afternoon's episode of <i>Roswell</i>. Alex died, suicide or is it murder?!?!?!?! Brush the teeth and floss.</p>

<p>Sleep time. Nighty night Internet.<br /></p>
