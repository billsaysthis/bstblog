<p>Neil <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/metropolitan/2437551">got married yesterday</a> but George and Jeb had better things to do, as did Neil's oldest child.</p>
<p>On a completely non-ha front, one of the sweeter women I know in this area got engaged yesterday. Congrats and best wishes to <a href="http://www.pamslife.com/2004_03_01_archives.html#107875498613867439">Pam</a> and Henry!</p>
