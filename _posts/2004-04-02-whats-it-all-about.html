<p>Scoble <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/04/02.html#a7136">alerts me</a> to news I find simply shocking: <a href="http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2004-04/sunflash.20040402.3.html">Sun</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/apr04/04-02SunAgreementPR.asp">Microsoft</a> have settled their legal differences. Slashdot has a <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/04/02/1416229">discussion</a> and The Register has <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/53/36770.html">an article</a>. Biggest parts of the news to me are that:<br />

<ul>
<li>Sun gets $2 billion cash from the nearly bottomless MSFT coffers;<br />
</li>
<li>Sun drops all outstanding litigation--meaning their very significant antitrust lawsuit--pending against MSFT and neither company will sue each otherover patent issues for the next 10 years;<br />
</li>
<li>Sun is firing yet another 10% of its employees, meaning it has now dumped over 14,000 employees (out of what was 44,000) since 2001 and I truly wonder what this will mean in terms of product development; and,<br />
</li>
<li>Sun promoted software head Jonathan Schwartz to president and chief operating officer, giving McNealey a bit of support he hasn't had since Zander left and announced <a href="http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2004-04/sunflash.20040402.1.html">preliminary Q3 results</a> of a loss in the 6-8 cents per share range not counting extraordinary items, below Street expectations.</li>
</ul>
<p>On this news, MSFT stock is up 2.31% (58 cents) while SUNW is up 19.81% (83 cents).</p>
