<p>As you may recall, my birthday was not all that long ago and I finally grabbed four pics out of my camera from that day. Vivian has more but she has had other things to worry about; those probably won't get posted until next week at the earliest. Here's me and Viv and me and Byron:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bill_viv_5402.jpg" alt="Bill and Vivian are still happy together, on Bill's 41st birthday" height="250" /> &nbsp; <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/byron_bill_5402.jpg" alt="Byron and Bill are still buds, on Bill's 41st birthday" height="250" /></p>
<p>There are also pictures of <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/picture.phtml?pict=viv_5402.jpg">Vivian</a> and <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/picture.phtml?pict=byron_5402.jpg">Byron</a> by themselves.</p>
