<p><strong>ATT not the only idiots @Home</strong></p>
<p>Now that more information is coming to light on the recent death of Excite@Home, it turns out that ATT Broadband managers are not the only ones who fucked up. The creditors are <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml;jsessionid=GQM5QVVGFQXFUCRBAEZSFEYKEEATIIWD?type=internetnews&amp;StoryID=439458">looking like idiots too</a>. They pushed ATT so hard during negotiations for the highspeed network that ATT walked away from the deal and the creditors were left with their dicks in their hands since no other company was interested in bidding. Now the network will shut down in a few months and the creditors are out the $400 million ATT was offering to pay. ATT still deserve to be smacked around for the way they handled the situaiton and left customers out in the cold but the creitors will have a hard time explaining this outcome to their investors. At least I'm (mostly) back online now.</p>
