<ul>
<li>Would <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/22/fashion/weddings/22VOWS.html?8hpib">this wedding location</a> been available if one of the parents wasn't a Congressman?</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/daily/chart/?sortdate=2003-06-20&amp;p=.htm">$62.6 million</a> sounds pretty good but are the studio execs really happy? Reviews like <a href="http://www.oliverwillis.com/entries/0603/review_hulk.html">Oliver's</a> are among the reasons I'm not jumping to hand over my movie money.
</li>
<li>Why are some people so comfortable making <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/06/19/teach_me_spanish_curse_words.html#c002495">idiotic assertions</a> yet unwilling to stand behind them?
</li>
<li>While I may agree with the sentiment, the shirts are not in any way a good idea and I <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/000808.html">don't want one</a>. This should have been in the form of a question but is such emphatic consistency really necessary?
</li>
<li>Are there legitimate uses for DeCSS and similar software? <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17791-2003Jun20.html?nav=hptoc_tn">Of course</a>. Are the folks at the MPAA and its backers a bunch of head in the sand doofii? Of course.</li>
</ul>
