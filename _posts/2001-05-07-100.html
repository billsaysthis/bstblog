<p><b>Yesterday's Movie: Wonder Boys</b>
<p>Definitely for those who like subtle, intellectual humor, <a href="http://www.wonderboysmovie.com/">Wonder Boys</a> stars <a href="http://www.michaeldouglas.com/html/html/michael_douglas.html" title="Probably Douglas's best work since The American President">Michael Douglas</a>, Tobey Maguire, Robert Downey Jr., Katie Holmes, and Frances McDormand in a movie about writers. Coming of age tales are usually focused on the teen set but novelist Michael Chabon has set us a tale where both student and teacher need to grow up; of course they do, but it takes a lot of weed, a dead dog, and the loss of a 2600 page novel to get them there. Excellent acting and a good story.</p>
