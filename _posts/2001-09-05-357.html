<p><b>HP/CPQ: It's all bad</b></p>
<p>The Merc had a major takeout on the merger this morning. Scott Herbold, the stock columnist, said the merger wasn't worth a hill of beans. <a href="http://web.siliconvalley.com/content/sv/opinion/dgillmor/weblog/">Dan Gillmor</a> said: "When one beleaguered giant buys another, you can smell the desperation. It's oozing from the corporate pores" at the two computer makers. Some observers see this as indicator of a wave of consolidation; Ernst &amp; Young, for example, is staffing up its San Jose office, which focuses on mergers and acquisitions. Employees are nervous and with a projected reduction of 15,000 staff I can't blame them.</p>
<p>The Reg has an <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/28/21481.html">insightful analysis</a> of how the talks began. Another side effect of SirCam?</p>
