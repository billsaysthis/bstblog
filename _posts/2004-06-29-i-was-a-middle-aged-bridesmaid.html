<p>Yes, this shocking if <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050530/">paraphrased cliche</a> headline is true! The reason for the radio silence here since Wednesday was a trip back East for my sister's wedding Saturday night. Although not formally encumbered with the title, I did stand up on her side, next to her lovely and gracious 17 year old stepdaughter Danielle. As Viv pointed out, that makes me a bridemaid though I fear I will never get to be the bride.</p>
<p>Which is okay. My sister waited a little longer for this night than I thought she ought to have but she was magnificent. Beautiful, a lovely gown, happy, generous, having fun and in control. I have a couple of photos snapped with the digital to post, probably tomorrow, and you'll see for yourself.</p>
<p>The gala was held at the The Mark in Manhattan, a very elegant hotel which is part of the global Mandarin Oriental group, with 120 family members and friends turning out in very fancy duds. I myself wore a stylish black tuxedo with silver vest and tie (at the bride's request) and my wife was stunning in a little black dress, strappy black shoes and her hair put up. My folks both looked terrific and were so happy for Joanne, Larry is an amazing guy and his family has quickly made her one of them.</p>
<p>The band, featured the last few years on Regis and Kelly's annual wedding giveaway show, was superb--I was surprised this singer was working weddings on Saturday nights. Even better, they did not play <em>Celebrate</em> or <em>Shout</em>, though perhaps they are now considered dated and outre, it's been awhile since I was at a fancy wedding. The food was yum, the cake was wonderful, this is a place you should consider if you affair is going to be in Manhattan.</p>
<p>My sister was a bit more enthusiastic than the rest of the bridal party about taking some outdoor photos before the even. The hotel is on 77th between Madison and Fifth, so we walked over to Fifth Avenue for some shots by Central Park but ended up walking past 81st to take them on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum--a very odd parade of tuxedoes, dresses and her in her wedding gown--but the photos were taken. The photographer seemed capable, will be interesting to see his final product.</p>
<p>One bit that I was a little concerned about up front was seeing my ex-wife Cindy and her friends, who are still close with my sister, for the first time in 14 years or so. But that all turned out pleasantly, she chatted with me for a minute, even said some very nice things to my Mom and then caught the bouquet.</p>
<p>Other parts of the trip were great too. We did get to the Springsteen exhibit at the Newark Museum, which was a bunch of fun. And met SportsFilter's goddam in the bargain, always good to meet online friends in person. Plus a morning after brunch at Jane's Restaurant down in Greenwich Village, awesome food and apparently the current hotspot; I can certainly recommend the Lobster Benny and Cosmopolitan Mimosa!</p>
