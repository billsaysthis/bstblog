<p>When I found out the tournament was going to be shown on Spanish language <a href="http://goltv.tv">GolTV</a> I resigned myself to missing out for the most part on whatever the announcers might be saying. It turns out, though, that they bought the <span style="font-style:italic;">English</span> language rights, UHF network TeleFutura holding the Spanish rights, and so everything, including pre-game and half time shows, are in English. Suh-weet!</p>
<p>Brazil-Mexico tomorrow and USA-Argentine Thursday, expect bloodbaths for both America del Norte sides.</p>
