<p>"I thought there was a monster in the potty." This was a line of dialog Bart said during the episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Simpsons</span> I watched tonight. In the car section of the paper this morning, a review mentioned that the new Dodge Megacab pickup truck has a list price of over $50,000. Now you tell me where the monster lives!</p>
