<p>These days you can hardly refresh your aggregator without hitting another new network and when I saw the <a href="http://www.moneyblognetwork.com/">Money Blog Network</a> this afternoon I realized the time had come when the bill:network needs to expand. Unlike all the others, though, my new network is not about creating an advertising platform or any other kind of platform. Instead, it's about making fun of all these blatant attempts to cash in.</p>
<p>Hence the name: <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sick From Lunch Network</span>. Do you want to join? The requirements are simple: be willing to put the still-to-be-designed logo on your page, linked to a master page which will list the members and our motto. "<span style="font-weight:bold;">Advertising is so 20th Century--we'd rather be sick from lunch and blog about it.</span>" Also, membership is at my discretion, though you can resign at any time. <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/contact.phtml?sub=Join%20Sick%20from%20lunch">Snarky applications</a> are preferred. Feel free to send logo suggestions too.</p>
