<p>TS1 and I want to get tickets for the <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1C003A34F2AEA4EB?brand=&amp;artistid=736365&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=1">U2 concert at HP Pavilion At San Jose</a> which go on sale in a bit more than an hour. There are three ticket prices, depending on seat location, and I wanted to know before we drive to the TM location how the seats are divided but of course the website doesn't have that posted. They'll still be happy to add a $12 or so PER TICKET service charge, of course, for the privilege of printing a ticket. In fact, looking at other concerts at HP Pavilion already on sale, I see that the TicketMaster scum will charge an extra $2.50 (per order, not ticket) if you want to speed up delivery by printing them on your own printer, supplying your own paper. Tell me this is not a monopolistic abuse of power, though if you do I will be laughing very loudly from two inches in front of your nose.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">60 minutes later:</span> Well, we drove over to the Tower Records store, which hosts the only local TM counter, but the "starting number" was 53 places ahead of our number. Better off having two computers to hit their website right at 10 than to wait in line so long so we drove home. Three minutes until the opening whistle...</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">A further 20 minutes on:</span> We got through on the website. Each of us purchased two of the $49.50 tickets, which is $99 face value though our credit card will see <span style="font-style:italic;">Total Charge: $119.55</span> because of the ridiculous fees charged by these wankers. All are in the same section (207, rows 14 and 15), but I can't see if one seat is on or close to the aisle; information important to me but not to TicketSlime.One pair will be resold later, or used as trade bait, so we can get an aisle seat.</p>
<p>The important thing is that we will be going to see U2. These guys are the last band (going by year of first record release) who I've really enjoyed year in and year out. Which really proves the old chestnut that the music you like in high school is the music you like the rest of your life. You can have your Dave Matthew Bands, your Radioheads, your White Stripes, no problem in my book, but I'll take some Bruce, Zeppelin, Beatles, Allman Brothers, Elvis (Presley or Costello), or U2 over all of them.<br /></p>
