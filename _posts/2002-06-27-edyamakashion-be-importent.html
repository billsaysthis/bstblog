<p>Two of my closest friends, who are also friends, happen to have daughters born in 1988. The two students graduated from their respective middle schools last week. Though it seems very strange to me to have friends with children this old, I actually have friends with children older than these! Here we have a picture of Carol and her mom Pam (names withheld to frustrate the insane) celebrating Carol's achievement:</p>
