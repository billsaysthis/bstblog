<p>"<a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=WIJ4UKCNX1PBWCRBAEKSFFA?type=topNews&amp;storyID=3808056">London police said</a> on Wednesday there would be no special 'exclusion zones' for President Bush's visit next week and he could easily come into contact with anti-war protesters." So sad that GWB will have to leave his cushy cocoon of fantasy.</p>
