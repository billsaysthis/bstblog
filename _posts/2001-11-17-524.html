<p><b>One of the South's most divine foods</b></p>
<p><a href="">Nakada</a>, who is probably a little <a href="http://mynakada.weblogs.com/stories/storyReader$94">too fond</a> of these delights for his own good, points us to the <a href="http://taquitos.net/yum/kk.shtml">Krispy Kreme Doughnuts appreciation page</a>. I didn't think it was possible but Taquitos Senior Editor Stewart Deck has compiled too much information on this simple snack food vendor. But looking through the site I realized that there are more people with too much time to spend on <a href="http://taquitos.net/chipworld/">snack foods</a>. I mean, a recipe for <a href="http://taquitos.net/yum/recipes.shtml">Keith's peanut butter and Cocoa Puffs sandwich on toast</a>? Oh god!</p>
