<p>Being on the job hunt these days is all about networking. sometimes, though, people take the idea of network just a bit too far. For instance, I just got an email on one of my subscribed mailing lists from someone who "met someone from Company X at a coffee shop yesterday." This person offered to forward any qualified resumes from other group members to his new contact.</p>
