<p>Slashdot has a really good thread today: <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/01/19/2318203&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=134">Top 10 New Sci-Fi/SF Authors?</a>. Since it isn't about Linux, Open Source, DRM, or Microsoft, there's very little of the childish and tediously repetitive comments to spoil it. Those of you who want to find recommendations for some new SF authors will be happy. There is a moderate level of duplication and, given the length of the thread, Slashdot's default interface will not make the reading easy but much meat to be had. Surprised me but with 875 comments posted no one has suggested Peter F. Hamilton and his <a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/martin.burcombe/confederation.html">Night's Dawn Trilogy</a>, which I would pick as one of the best of the '90s.</p>
