<p>Go to Guerrilla News Network and watch Eminem's new video <a href="http://www.gnn.tv/content/eminem_mosh.html">Mosh</a>. Doesn't matter if you are into rap or not, this is one of those songs that cuts across simplistic labels. The lyrics are clear and clean, the nusic is a basic beat and pulsing synth, and the message is straightforward: Bush must go. I really am beginning to wonder if get out the vote actions like this video, Rock the Vote and Puff Daddy's Vote or Die will get out a substantial number of younger voters, exactly the people who don't get counted in all those polls quoted in the news every day and probably more than enough to push the election to John Kerry. Take heart! [<em>via Adam Rifkin's <a href="http://ifindkarma.typepad.com/relax/2004/10/eminem_mosh.html">Relax</a></em>]</p>
