<p>Steven really lets it loose in his essay <a href="http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2002/03/Itaintmyfault.shtml">It ain't my fault</a>. "Africa is fucked...Asia is fucked...Europe is probably fucked, too. [South America]'s still fucked." He goes on to explain that everyone blames him (that is, Americans) for things they either did or did not do, either recently or some distant time in the past. But is America truly worthy of the blame, or are others using us as a scapegoat, a convenient target? "I find myself despairing, sometimes. It gets to be too much for me. Sometimes I feel like screaming at the top of my lungs, Why don't all you people solve your OWN fucking problems for a change?" Right on, Captain.</p>
