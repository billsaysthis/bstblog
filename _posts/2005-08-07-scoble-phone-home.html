<p>I was wondering why Robert Scoble, usually fairly prolific with the posting, hadn't been seen in my aggregator for awhile so I went over to the site and saw the comments on <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/07/31.html#a10804">his post supporting Molly Holzschlag</a>. Geez, people get rough but some of these guys were going like they were sticking pins in a Scoble voodoo doll for pleasure. Some of the time I feel, though much more mildly, that Rob goes a bit too far into cheerleading mode but damn. Rob, we love you anyway, turn off comments if you must, but get back on the horse!</p>
