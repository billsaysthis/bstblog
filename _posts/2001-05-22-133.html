<p><b>Where in the world is tolerance?</b><br />

<p>I look and look and look but it doesn't ever seem to get better. For example, the ruling Taliban is <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/south_asia/newsid_1345000/1345019.stm">forcing Hindus to wear tags in Afghanistan</a>, eerily reminiscent to the Nazi policy forcing Jews to wear yellow stars. In the Middle East, <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010522/pl/mideast_envoy_dc_1.html">Israelis and Palestinians</a> are unable to stop killing each other. In Northern Ireland, the peace accord is <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20010518/wl/northern_ireland_1.html">close to falling apart</a>. Multiple ethnic conflicts continue in Eastern Europe, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Africa. Even on a smaller level, incidents continue to occur across the U.S.</p>
<p>When will people realize that it's really a small planet and we have to learn to live together on it before we <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/2001_05_13_blog_archive.phtml#3660540">kill everyone</a>?</p>
