<p>"The Power of the Blogosphere" my ass. <a href="http://www.charlierose.com/search/search.asp">The Charlie Rose Show</a> had on <a href="http://www.instapundit.com/">Glenn Reynolds</a>, <a href="http://www.wonkette.com/">Anna Marie Cox</a>, <a href="http://www.andrewsullivan.com/">Andrew Sullivan</a> and <a href="http://www.joetrippi.com/">Joe Trippi</a> last night for a conversation about blogging and I was soooooooooo bored I deleted it off TiVo before the discussion was half over. All four of these people, while well-known, are all about the politics. How could they not have on someone like <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a> (okay not my favorite person but still...), <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/">Matt</a> <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/">Haughey</a> (plus <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/">MetaFilter</a>), or even, yes I'll go there, <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scoble</a>. The show would even have been better if they'd just left one or two of the guests off, they were all talking on top of each other and Rose couldn't control things.</p>
