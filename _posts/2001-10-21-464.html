<p><b>Political Cartoonist gets to the heart of the matter</b></p>
<p>Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oliverwillis.com<br />
<br />"&gt;Oliver Willis we see a <a href="http://seattlep-i.nwsource.com/horsey/viewbydate.asp?id=507">cartoon by David Horsey</a> from the Seatlle Post-Intelligencer that with three characters and two sentences captures the essence of the problem I have with pacifists in the current environment. Steven, as usual, has an <a href="http://denbeste.nu/entries/00001160.shtml">excellent response</a> to the logically fallacious anti-war faction; essentially logic is a fundamental truth of the universe, not subject to personal interpretation, even though some people would like to believe otherwise.</p>
