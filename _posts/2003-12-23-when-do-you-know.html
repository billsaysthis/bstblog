<p>Ruth Wedgwood, a former federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/23/opinion/23WEDG.html?pagewanted=all&amp;position=">presents an interesting argument</a> in favor of the Bush administration's detention of alleged Al Qaeda member Jose Padilla. Boils down to <em>"By the logic of last week's [apellate court] decision, the president could not have held the hijackers as combatants--even after they had entered the United States, even with habeas corpus review of the president's decision, until the moment they appeared at Logan Airport with box cutters."</em></p>
