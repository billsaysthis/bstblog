<p>Sun Microsystems stock is trading down a couple of cents as I write this, at $4 even, so I guess this means Wall Street is not expecting much from today's after the close quarterly earnings announcement. Sure those were the days of the dot com bubble but I remember when the share price was surging almost every day. If the change was only 25 or 30 cents we'd be grumbling after work. Up, up and split, up, up and split. The stock was $48/share on Sep. 1, 1998, the day NetDynamics offically became part of Sun and peaked at a (split-adjusted) $514.56 <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=SUNW&amp;a=07&amp;b=11&amp;c=200&amp;d=08&amp;e=5&amp;f=2000&amp;g=d">exactly two years later</a>. Just reminiscing, not likely to ever see such things again. Except that investor psychology does get caught up in itself and so maybe we will.</p>
