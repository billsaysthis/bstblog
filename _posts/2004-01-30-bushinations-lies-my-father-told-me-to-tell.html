<p>One of the aspects of our system of organization (that is, both government and corporate) is that "nobodies" like me or you, Dear Reader, can actually get straight, honest answers from people in positions of authority. So when Somebody makes a decision or pronouncement that makes no sense at all (in terms of consistent internal logic), the great unwashed masses have no way to reach clarity. The list below has three strong examples of out and out falsehood by our Chief Executive but the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit200401229.html">latest Cringley</a> has a similar analysis of the offshoring problem.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>"How is it patriotic to place one's re-election worries before the need of the American people and the 9/11 families to know what mistakes were made leading up to the worst attack on American soil?"</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/30/opinion/L30WTCC.html?ex=1390798800&amp;en=e204801c003f7a16&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">Andrew Rice</a>, brother of 9/11 victim David, on the Bush Administration's opposition to extend the work of the committee investigating the events of that day.</p>
</li>
<li>Somehow, two months ago it was $400 billion; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/30/politics/30DEFI.html?ex=1390798800&amp;en=f84eec6db029995c&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">now it's $540 billion</a>. The real question is how could the Administration not have known the difference, or rather, why weren't they honest in the first place? Because, of course, at the higher figure the bill would have never passed Congress.
</li>
<li>The biggest lie is that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. I'm sick when I think back to the days just before the US attacked Iraq and I was thinking that, well, those are some pretty serious weapons and if he has them, he needs to go. Now I realize that people are dying over there, Americans, Iraqis, Brits, Italians and more, because so many Americans believed the words coming out of Bush's mouth. Hell, just last week Cheney was over in Davos claiming there is evidence yet to be found. Now the party line is that Hussein was a bad, bad man (no doubt about that) and he just had to go; if he didn't quite have NBC ready to go, <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001726.shtml">he surely would soon have gotten there soon</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps listening to Kevin Phillips <a href="http://www.onpointradio.org/shows/2004/01/20040129_b_main.asp">on the Bush dynasty</a> would be a good refresher course for those who doubt what Bush is all about. And perhaps one of you Dear Readers can explain to me how we, the Sheep, can get honest answers.</p>
