<p>Interesting new collection at RawSugar: <a href="http://www.rawsugar.com/collections/guyt/ajax">Ajax for the programmer - anotated searchable index </a>. If you're a web-focused geek, Ajax is one of the hotter topics of discussion at this moment.</p>
<p><em>On a completely different note</em>, I continue to be amazed at how unaware people can be of their lives. The challenge question this morning on KFOG, prize was a pair of front row seats to tonight's Robert Plant concert, was name all nine counties that make up the government-defined Bay Area. Now, I don't expect everyone to know all nine--Solano County's pretty obscure down here in the South Bay, for instance--but of the first five callers, three didn't even name San Francisco!</p>
