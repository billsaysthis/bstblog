<p>I love this: I'm watching the Earthquakes match <a title="Doubt this link will do much good after the game ends" href="http://media.yahoo.com/broadband/go/soccer/player?key=/mls/game/20040821dalsan">live on the web</a> thanks to Yahoo! Sports. There is no local show but the game is being televised back to Dallas (I'm guessing, given the bias of the ads and commentary) so someone made the deal to put the feed up. From <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/s/soccerpass?p=mls">the schedule</a> on the broadcast page, several games a week are available this way so if you don't have FoxSportsWorld to get the games regularly on cable, check this out. The choice is between a fairly small but sharp picture or fullscreen and blurry.</p>
<p>Doesn't hurt that the Quakes are winning 2-0 as I write this, at the half.</p>
<p>However, if the news on the team staying in San Jose doesn't change by Sep. 17 I wonder how much attention I'll be giving to MLS after this season. FSW shows plenty of high quality EPL, French, Dutch, German, Brazilian and Argentinean football, more than enough to sate my demand if MLS leaves the Bay Area.</p>
<p><em>Final:</em> The Quakes put another ball in the netting, Landon putting it right onto Ching and it was over with half an hour left (<a href="http://sanjose.earthquakes.mlsnet.com/MLS/scoreboard/game.jsp?match=08212004_DALSJ">stats</a>). Excellent overall performance, with Onstad needing to make only one real save all night. We jump ahead of Dallas and out of the basement, next weekend Colorado comes to town and if all goes right we'll be in third place and setting up a run to the playoffs.<br /></p>
