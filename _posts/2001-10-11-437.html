<p><b>Today's movie: Training Day</b></p>
<p>Are you up for a powerful, nasty, angry movie? Then see <a href="http://trainingday.warnerbros.com/">Training Day</a>, because <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Washington,+Denzel">Denzel Washington</a> and Ethan Hawke blow up the screen in it. Aside from having Washington continually call Hawke the n-word and dog, director Antoine Fuqua makes this a movie of eyes, lots of massive closeups on the two leads as they talk. Fuqua also directed <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120008">The Replacement Killers</a> (Chow-Yun Fat) and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0211938">Bait</a> (Jamie Foxx), so he's pretty much three for three with movies I enjoyed. Washington is <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0107616">always good</a> and Hawke, well he was great in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0097165">Dead Poets Society</a>.</p>
