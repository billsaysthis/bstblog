<p>Tivo has an <a href="http://www3.tivo.com/tivo-misc/subunsub/show.do">email newsletter</a> for subscribers and there's occasionally a useful morsel so I get it. But then you get one like today's (sorry, the marketing-fu over in Alviso just isn't up to posting these on the web), which leads off with the reason enough to unsubscribe:</p>
<p><em>"Not yet a member of TiVo Rewards? You're crazy."</em></p>
<p>I shit you not.</p>
