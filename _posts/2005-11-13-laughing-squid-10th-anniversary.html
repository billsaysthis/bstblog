<p>Congratulations to Scott "Laughing Squid" Beale on tonight's <a href="http://laughingsquid.com/2005/11/08/laughing-squid-10th-anniversary-details/">10th Anniversary Party</a> for his off-the-beaten path hosting company. I've run into Scott a few times recently and he really represents the best of what underlies the San Francisco stereotype. Which are, after all, usually based on some distortion of reality and that's what Scott is. He shows up at so many events, happenings and parties I wonder if he bothers to keep an apartment/house or just has a dresser and shower in the office! <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laughingsquid/">Always with a camera too</a>. Happy 10 years, pal, and best wishes for many more decades of merging art, commerce and community. [<em>tag: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/laughingsquid">laughingsquid</a></em>]</p>
