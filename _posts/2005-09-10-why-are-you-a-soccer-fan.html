<p>Soccer Silicon Valley opened a blog and this was the title of <a href="http://blog.soccersiliconvalley.com/archives/2005/09/why_are_you_a_s.html">their second post</a>. However, I think the blog writers need some poking and so posted the following as my comment, just posting here for my memory and in case it mysteriously disappears:</p>
<p>Been a fan since I worked Cosmos games at Giants Stadium for the food concessionaire. Big Quakes, USA and Liverpool supporter.</p>
<p>Having a blog is a good idea but after two posts and no useful information about what's going on with the team I wonder if it'll be worth your trouble.</p>
<p>I don't like all the secrecy regarding the ownership change and potential sites. Anyone who would want to lead, or be part of, a new investment group should actively be recruiting support from this fan base to show AEG and MLS they understand what is in place and that they can be part of it.</p>
<p>Finally, what makes the SSV leaders qualified to be involved and know what's going on and not the rest of us? Infrequent request for letterwriting and phone campaigns aside, there have not be any opportunities for people like myself to be part of this process and I think that's a mistake.</p>
