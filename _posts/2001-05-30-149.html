<p><b>Off the Mark: Cartoons for laughing at</b><br />

<p>Hey! I've had my first email from someone who only knows of me by reading this weblog. From David Allen and the unconventional minds at Plan Nine Publishing, cartoonist Mark Parisi brings us his third collection, <a href="http://www.plan9.org/otm3.html">The off the mark Science Fiction Picture Show</a>. Laugh at Buffy, Star Trek, Teletubbies in 'toons heavily influenced by The Far Side style of Gary Larson. Plan 9 also carries Sluggy Freelance, Bill  Dave, and Nukees. Check'em out!</p>
