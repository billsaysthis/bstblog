<p><b>Jumping The Shark</b><br />

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.topfive.com/">Top5</a> (a very funny email list everyone should be reading), I found out about this site. Great place if you are a fan of TV or just love to bitch about it. A show <a href="http://www.jumptheshark.com/">"jumps the shark"</a> in that instant that you know from now on...it's all downhill. On this site you can post your two cents, read what others have said, and vote on when your favorite show hit that moment.The term is a reference to the "Happy Days" episode in which Fonzie jumps a shark with his motorcycle. Some of the big categories are: Ted McGinley (he cn kill a show just by appearing on it), Death, A Very Special Episode, and They Did It.</p>
