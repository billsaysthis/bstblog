<p>The use of silence is a very effective dramatic tool. Silence also makes a writer's life much easier, allowing (forcing) the audience to bring imagination to a scene where the writer has not, or cannot, find words to convey meaning. Actors may embellish with an arched eyebrow, an upturned hand softly lowered, yet the writer hasn't put a word to page.</p>
