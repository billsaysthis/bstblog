<p><b>Still more good fortune</b></p>
<p>For the third year in a row, I was happy to be invited to share the holiday with my buddy Byron and his family. What a great meal! Far too much food, I could have burst on the drive home. Thanks to Pam for the great stuffed mushroom recipe. Anyway, here are a <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/content/galleries/thanks_2001.phtml">few pictures</a>. I like this one, of me and Byron:</p>

<p>Just looking at my belt, you can see how good the food was, thanks to Mrs. Nevins and Caroline!</p>
