<p><b>Some people are sick, others just wacky</b></p>
<p>A laugh is a good thing almost anytime but especially so this week, so I was glad to run across this <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/09-14-2001/0001572054&amp;EDATE=">Raelian press release</a>. The Raelians are a way-out-there religious group who are pressing ahead with human cloning plans. Their tie in with the tragedy? In this press release they explain that "cloning technology ... will make terrorist attacks inefficient in the future" by allowing complete replacement of adults including reasonably up todate memories. Ok, well, yeah, ya see.. [Call the guys with the funny white jackets.]</p>
<p>Why do I say the Raelians are out there? Here's a snip from the quick summary (their name) of their religon: Life on Earth is not the result of random evolution or a supernatural 'God' but rather was planted here by extraterrestrial scientists (the word Elohim in Genesis, generally translated as God, actually means "those who came from the sky") and now these aliens are going to return. To prepare the way, the aliens asked French journalist Rael to establish an embassy here on Earth for them. The embassy is to serve the same function as other earthly embassies, giving the aliens a safe haven to safely land  at and from which they can treat on a neutral, non-discriminatory basis with all governments and peoples. Need more detail? You can <a href="http://www.rael.org/int/english/vshop/vshop.html">purchase</a> the books Rael has written, The Message given by Extra-Terrestrials, Let's Welcome Our Fathers From Space, and Sensual Meditation.</p>
