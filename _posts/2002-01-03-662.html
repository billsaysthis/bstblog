<p><strong>Searchers: Rex Grossman is not Jewish</strong></p>
<p>Every so often I will look at the referrers list for my website. One recurring item is someone searching to find out whether University of Florida Rex Grossman is Jewish or not. Well, according to JewishSports.com's <a href="http://www.jewishsports.com/news/fall2000.htm">Fall 2000 News</a>, he isn't. But because I have a previous weblog entry <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_12_09_blog_archive.phtml#7843258">mentioning him</a> and another with the word <a href="http://www.billsaysthis.com/blog/blogarch.phtml?archdate=2001_12_09_blog_archive.phtml#7785745">Jewish</a> in it, both on the same archive page, I show up high in Google searches. Anyway, hopefully this entry will answer the question for you.</p>
<p>I also show up near the top on a search for <a href="http://google.yahoo.com/bin/query?p=sexy+Better+Bill+sites&amp;hc=0&amp;hs=0">sexy Better Bill sites</a> but that seems more reasonable to me. Of course.</p>
