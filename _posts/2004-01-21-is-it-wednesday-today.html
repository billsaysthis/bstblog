<p>Don't you just love the way the Bush Administration is <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,8454938%255E23289,00.html">protecting our right to be obese</a> from those nasty foreigners!</p>
<p>USA Network <a href="http://comingsoon.net/news.php?id=3090">has given the green light</a> to a very strange sounding take on the Frankenstein story; first as a movie and possibly as a weekly series after that. The monster and the doc are 200 years old now, living in Seattle.</p>

<p>Except for the cold, the no air, and the pink and red color scheme, Mars <a href="http://www.lyle.org/mars/imagery/color/127515369-7.jpg">looks like a great place to visit</a> (many other interesting photos and such on the <a href="http://www.lyle.org/mars/">Spirit Imagery page</a>).</p>
