<p>The SEC is <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-wrap26.4mar26,1,615001.story?coll=la-headlines-business">going to use</a> $52.5 million dollars out of the settlements paid by various Wall Street firms for the nefarious schemes--misconduct by research analysts--to fund investor education programs. Does this sound to anyone else the way it does to me, that this money will essentially be used to advertise services of which the guilty parties are the largest sellers? Education my ass.</p>

Got to ask Steve when this will change...</p>
