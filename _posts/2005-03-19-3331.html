<p>Holy cow, more good news: HBO has signed on the dotted line for a fourth season of The Wire! Production is late this year for 12 episodes to air early 2006, no word on the story line, and Dominic West may or may not be back though everyone else is signed. <span style="font-style:italic;">Excellent!</span></p>
