<p>Everyone makes fun of <a href="http://www.ebbflux.com/postmodern/">postmodernism</a>. And by everybody I mean semi-educated folks like myself who don't do it for a living. But trying to get your head around it if you haven't studied it extensively is absolutely mindbending. If you don't believe me, check out this really good MeFi post and discussion: <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/23775">Postmodern Infotainment: I Rrivolously Link - You Decide</a>. Be sure and read the comments, including <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/23775#441550">Rusty's informed defense</a>, and don't miss the whack Mr. T parody link.</p>
