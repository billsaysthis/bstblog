<p>Two articles in today's <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> that I happened to read consecutively make a good match:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/05/national/05retire.html?ex=1254628800&amp;en=2e65f714f7aee383&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">Pension Failures Foil 6-Figure Retirements, Too</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/05/business/05shelter.html?ex=1254628800&amp;amp;en=defe2845ac1dc7a9&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">Republicans Try to Dilute Provisions in Tax Bill</a></p>
<p>What good will it do us to survive into our 70s and 80s if we have to work like dogs "bagging groceries at Publix" or flipping burgers just to pay medical bills? Of course today's business execs should read these articles with a wary eye, understanding that once they're gone from the stage they'll be just as forgotten.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Later:</span> Security surely is not the kind of crap Neocon analysis as posed by Michael Ledeen in <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/ledeen/ledeen200410050930.asp">this National Review column</a>. [<span style="font-style:italic;">via <a href="http://www.jimgilliam.com/2004/10/did_i_say_iraq_i_meant_iran.php">Jim Gilliam</a></span>]<br /></p>
