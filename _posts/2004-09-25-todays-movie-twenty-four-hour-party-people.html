<p>A lot of people liked this movie. Not enough for it to make a profit but a lot of, um, the right people, the cool people, the people who were into the post-NewWave English music scene of the early '80s. For them <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274309/">Twenty Four Hour Party People</a> is a trip home, I guess, but for me wasn't even worth finishing. I couldn't connect with the dark humor and not being a fan of Steve Coogan's Alan Partridge TV character nor the bands involved (Joy Division, New Order) so I hit the delete button after about 45 minutes.</p>
