<p><strong>Micro-advertising experiment, days 15 and 16: the party's over</strong></p>
<p>Well, two weeks of amusing myself with the MetaFilter text ad are over and all 5,000 impressions have been served and through the ad 72 visitors came to this site, a clickthrough rate of 1.44%; a graph shows the entire run of the ad. The last two days had four clickthroughs out of 304 for a 1.32% CTR. <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/">Matt</a>, thanks for the fun! And if any of you are new regular or semi-regular visitors, welcome to the party--the party's over, long live the party!</p>

<p>Another happy note: the BillSaysThis visitor counter went past 5,000 last night and is up to 5,022 as of this writing. Talk about your woo-fucking-hoo!<br /></p>
