<p>To <a href="mailto:letters@nytimes.com">the Editor</a>,</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/10/opinion/10SAFI.html?ex=1399521600&amp;en=0898ce64f1ff32ee&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">today's column</a> William Safire states "In last week's apology before the Senate, Rumsfeld assumed ultimate responsibility."</p>
<p>The one question I would love to see answered, by him or even better by a senior member of the Administration, is what this assumption actually means in practical terms. If Secretary Rumsfeld is not going to resign, as Safire states is unwarranted, than what is Rumsfeld's statement other than words trying to absorb guilt like a sponge? Is he, like a pro athlete who's mouthed off to a coach, gong to be benched for a game or two? Fined? Sadly, it seems like the Bush Administration, Mr. Safire and other Republicans are content to once again overlook bad actions based on easily mouthed but action-free apologies.</p>
