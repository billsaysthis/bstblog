<p>I've made some phone calls and done some further research. Seems like one of the weak points of the BASOC bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics here is the need to build 3,000 residential units for the Village here in Mountain View. I say weak because if they can't get approval for it there is not much in the way of backup, at least not that they've publicly described.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this housing would be built on land owned and controlled by the Department of Defense and the Army, so the City of Mountain View has no control over planning and zoning compliance. Suckage! Next step is to contact Rep. Anna Eshoo and California's senators. Somehow I doubt they'll be too inclined to help me out here. More suckage!</p>
