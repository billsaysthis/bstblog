<p>Okay, no overtime, but my boys have no one to blame but themselves, they choked under the pressure of the extra man. The Brazilians showed all the technical skill they are famous for, stopping passes with chest or foot precisely in place, sliding passes through slender openings, running the other team off the ball. Posession football. Now Brazil rests up to meet the winner of Senegal-Turkey in Saitama, Japan, in five days.</p>
<p>Three hours to wait for USA-Germany</p>
