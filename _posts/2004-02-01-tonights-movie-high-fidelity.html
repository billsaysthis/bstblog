<p>Top five reasons why <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146882/">High Fidelity</a> is one of my all time favorite movies:</p>
<ol>
<li>A romantic comedy with intelligence and wit, a plot that is in constant motion, well-contrasted characters who find organic growth. More laughs <em>and</em> smiles per square meter of film stock than you can shake a stick at.</p>
</li>
<li>John Cusack is one of the great American actors whether he gets the credit for it or not. <em>High Fidelity</em> uses his ability for believability and physical humor and contrasts him so well with Jack Black (going over the top) and Todd Louiso (just the opposite, barely animated).
</li>
<li>Lots and lots of great music, much of which is woven directly into the plot and not just used as background. And the artists are all over the place: Springsteen, Aretha, Bow Wow Wow, Belle &amp; Sebastian, Liz Phair, Ann Peebles, Illinois Jacquet, Stiff Little Fingers and more.
</li>
<li>You can watch it many times and see some new bit or some scene in a new light each time. Plus it's difficult to get tired of seeing Catherine Zeta-Jones pull off her top.
</li>
<li>Bruce Springsteen makes a cameo, sitting back playing his Telecaster and giving Rob sage advice</li>
</ol>
