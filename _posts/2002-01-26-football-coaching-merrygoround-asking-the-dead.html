<p>In a largely sucessful attempt at being wacky, Rick Kamla talks to the spirits of some dear departed (Lombardi, Hendrix, Hartman, MLK...) in<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.fanball.com/web/fb/content/feature.cfc?ID=26668">Kamla Unfiltered: Altered State of the NFL</a> to get some answers on the NFL. Read the whole thing but I like the coaching comments well down into the article as Kamla has 'Phil Hartman' get nasty on Tampa Bay and San Diego. Both teams are still headless.</p>
<p>In other news, John Fox was announced as the new coach of the Panthers yesterday. He immediately named former All-Pro linebacker Jack Del Rio, an All American at USC in his college days who won notice as linebackers coach the last few years at Baltimore, his defensive coordinator.</p>
<p>San Diego seemed headed for ex-Cleveland, Kansas City, and Washington head coach Marty Schottenheimer until he and GM John Butler bumped ugly over the issue of personnel control. Butler has it and Schottenheimer wants it. Marty can afford to be picky, somewhat, since the Redskins are on the hook for $2.5 million a year for the next three years less whatever another team pays him. But he's getting older and one wonders how marketable he'll be in 2003 if no job comes together this year.</p>
