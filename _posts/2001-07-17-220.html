<p><b>Tonight's movie, sort of: Touching Evil</b><br />

<p>Well, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/mystery/programs/evil/full.html">Touching Evil</a> isn't a movie but a TV series, although tonight's broadcast of the first episode was two hours long. A British import shown on PBS' Mystery, this detective show was pretty good if you're willing to put up with not understanding all the dialog due to mumbling Britishisms. Robson Green stars as a detective inspector just back to work after recovering from a gunshot to his brain and he's up against a nasty bit of work in pharmaceutical engineer Dr. Ronald Hinks (<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?McDiarmid,+Ian">Ian McDiarmid</a>, Chancellor Palpatine in Star Wars Episodes I and II). Given the vagaries of public television scheduling, I sure hope the next episode is on at the same time next week; according to the <a href="http://www.kcsm.org/tv60.html">KCSM</a> schedule, it is.</p>
