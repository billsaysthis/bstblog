<p>Ev is advertising the position I previously filled for them: <a href="http://www.pyra.com/jobs/customer_support.asp">Pyra Labs - Jobs: Customer Support</a>. You'll be working with a great group of customers and good people at Pyra. Just remember, when things get tough, to repeat to yourself, with eyes closed and face turned towards the sky, this little mantra: "The customer support rep did not write Blogger. The customer support rep did not select, install, or configure the servers. The customer support rep did not make malicious changes to the customer's template."</p>
