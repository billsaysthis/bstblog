<p>American politics today appears to be reaching a point of collapse. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell precisely captured the problem by publicly stating that his party's plan for the next two years is to block any legislation proposed by the Democrats unless the bill follows GOP dictates. President Obama's recent actions and speeches have me believing he can't see the forest for the trees.</p>
<p>[John Robb, among others, has recognized this threat and is developing a solution called Resilient Communities but such efforts seem unlikely to make a sufficient impact soon enough.]</p>
