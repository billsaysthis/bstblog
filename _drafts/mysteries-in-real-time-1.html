<p>I'm a fat fuck. Pushing deep into my 40s, there's little hope I'll ever reach that dream of just being a tad chubby. I'm fat and hell, if I'm being this honest I should add that I have boundary and control issues. If I didn't I wouldn't have told you that, eh?</p>
<p>I'm still someone who nevertheless can help you with a life changing and even life threatening problem. My mind works just fine at finding and churning the right data. The payoff from a good education and thousands and thousands of hours of reading thought-provoking books and watching buttloads of movies and TV.</p>
<p>Hence the fat fuck part, which means I won't be throwing any bad men with guns out of your home or office. Here's a boundary breaker for you: If someone pulled a gun on me while I'm trying to help you I'll probably piss my pants. Then again, for all the years of doing this no one's actually felt it necessary to draw a gun in my presence.</p>
<p>That's what I said in my little mental devil voice when I saw the look on the face of the well-dressed, jogger-lean man sitting in the not-quite comfortable chair across my mostly neat office desk. He was a referral from a man whose wife and bank account were safe and sound, but clearly was not seeing that capability on first impression.</p>
