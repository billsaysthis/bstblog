<p>For most folks, the answer is logical analysis. That is, they add up the pluses and minuses and take the side of the ledger that has the surplus. Not everyone is very good at understanding the factors involved, my own record is not terrific, and for sure no one takes the time to think through every decision rigorously. Still, in the main people do not flips a coin or roll a pair of dice.</p>
<p>This raises the question of why so many people believe in a deity in the vein of the Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions. If, for example, miracles of the kind recorded in the book of those religions still occurred, or at least occurred as recently as the last couple of hundred years (i.e., post-Enlightenment), this would be less of a question. However, they don't and so the choice by these otherwise reasonably logical folks to base life decisions as if they did is puzzling.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying existence has no creator—even if current quantum physics suggest that material existence came into being simply due to the potential for it to happen or that the very fact of our existence plays a part in defining the so-called laws of nature—because if that were the case then we're left with what I like to call the "turtles all the way down" problem. Put it another way, who or what created the potential? Frankly, to me the answer is simply beyond our understanding, at least for now.</p>
<p>Accordingly, then, there is no logical support for using Bible/Koran/Torah as literal rules for life. Of course, just as not everyone consistently uses logic to make decision, neither do religious adherents always follow the rules laid down in their particular book. But let's take self-described religious believers, which would be more than 90% of all Americans, at their word.</p>
<p>Essentially,  our society suffers from a mass delusion. If all this amounted to were Saturday and Sunday morning services, the occasional proselytizer and TV evangelist shouting at us to behave then no big whoop.</p>
<p>But the impact is far worse than that. I honestly believe many of the decisions being made by the Bush Administration have religion as the second most significant factor, right after doing what's best for their corporate benefactors. Of course, most of the world's terrorists claim to be inspired by their god, including Al Qaeda, Hamas, Hizbullah, the Irish Republican Army, the Kurdish Freedom Fighters and the Tamil Tigers. I'm not sure if the few remaining communist groups, such as FARC and the Nepalese, fall into this line of thinking but that hardly dents the argument.</p>
