<p>Mr. Dayley always liked learning his lessons. He especially liked lessons he was told not to learn or that others did not see. He was the first child in his kindergarten to learn to read, to do simple math, to understand the rules of playground games. As a teen he was the first of his friends to have girlfriend, the first to 'experiment' with kissing another boy, the first to sample marijuana (and the first to say no, too)</p>
<p>Mr. Dayley soaked up college life, it was like drinking straight from a hose for four full years. Classes, clubs, fraternities, girls, boys, art, science and running through them all politics. Oh yes, this was a big lesson to learn! Three years it took him to thoroughly grasp the complexities of how politics was the lever from which he could move the world. His senior year was as close to Paradise as he thought reality allowed.</p>
