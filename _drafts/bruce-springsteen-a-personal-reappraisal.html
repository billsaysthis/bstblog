<p>I still get no more joy from music than listening to my favorite albums by the Jersey boy, yet I don't feel the same about him as 20 years ago. To some degree the change is due to the normal passage of time, Bruce's own changes as a man and musician and, perhaps most of all, because when your parents told the teenaged you things will seem different when you're older they were right.</p>
<p>One perceived change in the music is a sense of intention. What I mean by this is that Bruce seems to be attempting to control every aspect of his recordings, not just the normal superstar need for everything to be just so but at a level of detail one rarely encounters anywhere. Perhaps throw in a smidge of forcing the material into specific channels. One example of the former is the change in how Bruce sings, from very casual back in the '70s to tightly controlling the muscles of his mouth the last 15 years or so; an example of the latter is last year's Seeger Sessions release, which I think Bruce was determined to prove that his folk music could be upbeat and as appealling as his rockers.</p>
