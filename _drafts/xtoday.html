<h3>Version 1</h3>
<p>When you wake up in the morning<br />
Do you take an easy breath or<br />
Does your chest tighten<br />
Fluttering rapidly like hummingbird wings?</p>
<p>When I look out the window I see the same<br />
View as my Sweet One but somehow instead<br />
We don't see the same thing, at least<br />
What we see doesn't have the same impact on our souls.</p>
<p>When we drive to work I am thinking about<br />
All that can go wrong that day and she jokes<br />
About her co-workers or a show from last night and<br />
I think she is the one of us afraid of everything.</p>
<p>When does the terror that keeps me up at night and<br />
Invades my waking hours more and more often<br />
Distracting me from most of the small bits of<br />
Joy and happiness that I know can be had?</p>
<h3>Version 2</h3>
<p>When you wake up in the morning<br />
Do you take an easy breath or<br />
Does your chest tighten<br />
Fluttering rapidly like hummingbird wings?</p>
<p>When I look out the window I see the same<br />
View as my Sweet One but somehow instead<br />
We don't see the same thing, at least<br />
What we see doesn't have the same impact on our souls.</p>
<p>When we drive to work I am thinking about<br />
All that can go wrong that day and she jokes<br />
About her co-workers or a show from last night and<br />
I think she is the one of us afraid of everything.</p>
<p>When some well-meaning friend spouts a clich√©<br />
"it's always darkest before the dawn" or<br />
"God helps those who help themselves"<br />
Remember connecting your fist to his nose is wrong.</p>
